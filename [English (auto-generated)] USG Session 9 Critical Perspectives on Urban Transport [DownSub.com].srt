1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
should be recording automatically but

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,100
well it is now thanks for thanks for

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,039
reminding me so double rationality the

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,980
rationality of the discipline uh which

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,719
is taken as uh some kind of

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,199
um Fields deriving from Natural Sciences

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,140
alluding to laws of physics which

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,600
apparently help to understand where

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,960
people go how they move around the city

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,060
um and the rationality of the of the

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,800
people themselves of the users of

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,020
passengers drivers who make rational

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,200
economic choices in terms of where they

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,520
go how they go

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,879
how does this apply to the city uh well

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,340
basically the city's approach as a clean

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,820
slate so it's social political spatial

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,480
complexity it's seen if it is seen it's

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,640
seen as an obstacle to these principles

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,980
of rational planning

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,079
um if it's not seen then basically well

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,079
this planning is applied as if on a

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,160
clean slate

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
which

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
in this particular slide maybe this is a

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,900
bit of an exaggeration these are plans

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,180
from the cocusier who was really very

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,340
back then it was called bold or

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,159
courageous in terms of proposing to

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
actually demolish all's uh neighborhoods

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,979
or whole cities to to give way to this

32
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,200
rational modern planning

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,540
um but a lot of these planning

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,799
principles have been applied and I'm

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,240
sure that you've been to maybe even

36
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,400
lived in cities where

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,720
um whole neighborhoods if not whole

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,159
cities have been designed according to

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,020
this principle of rationality speed

40
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,920
modernity that of course focused on or

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,979
framed the car the private vehicle as

42
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,920
the ultimate most rational most

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,200
liberating mode of of Mobility mode of

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,640
transport

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,500
we also arrived last time to this

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,659
growing reflection starting from the

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,479
1970s and then through the 1980s and

48
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,840
1990s on many different problems related

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,720
to car and automobility so there's wider

50
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,500
social uh phenomenon related to to

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,440
massification and commodification of of

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,360
private cars

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,220
so a lot of social issues have been

54
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,260
raised and primarily environmental

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,020
issues have been raised with regards to

56
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,220
automobility with regard with regard to

57
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,260
the car and to be frank I think in a lot

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,440
of Transport debates whether in Academia

59
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,860
or an activism or in policy in Brussels

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,360
I think is quite apparent in many other

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,580
Belgian cities too this is where we are

62
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,800
this is still very much the dominant

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,260
Paradigm in terms of how policy is Being

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,000
Framed and how research is being done

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
Harris are considered to be something

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,840
detrimental to the quality of urban

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,140
space to a living

68
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,459
be it because of its environmental

69
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,920
impacts the pollution noise accidents

70
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,379
that it causes uh it's a very dangerous

71
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,819
mode of transport

72
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,920
for those of course who are outside of

73
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,220
the car and Clash collide with it or

74
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,019
it's spatial Footprints all right so the

75
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,780
the spatial uh impact of the the

76
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,400
infrastructure the amount of square

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,500
meters that have to be devoted to this

78
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,819
particular amount of Transport in order

79
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,120
for it to uh to be able to uh to move

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,920
around the city so I'm thinking here

81
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,599
about all the urban motorways the

82
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,819
parking lots Junctions and all that that

83
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,560
has to be present in the city for the

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,319
car to uh to be a a valid uh useful of

85
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,060
of moving around

86
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,340
so this is what we did last time

87
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,720
uh

88
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,940
a bit of an well not an interlude but

89
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,400
what happened also uh throughout the

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,379
1970s and 80s is that in the global

91
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,019
North at least in so-called developed

92
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,239
countries such as Belgium but also

93
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,239
across the pond in North America cities

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,599
have uh entered into a post-foldist era

95
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,920
and I'm sure this has been covered a lot

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,659
by David and probably a little bit by

97
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,879
Nick and here I'm going to focus much

98
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,980
more on the transport related impact of

99
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,420
that shift of course it was not

100
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,459
something that happened over a day and

101
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,099
it's difficult to tell or to pinpoint

102
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,580
when did for this cities

103
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,379
you know conclude the existence and and

104
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,299
we move to prosperity and it's more of a

105
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,700
longer process that happened over over a

106
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,858
long period of time at least at least

107
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,858
years if not decades but what's very

108
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,358
important there is that if you go back

109
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,720
to these um curves and that are somewhat

110
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,820
similar to contratives waves of

111
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,600
different Innovation waves uh 1960s 70s

112
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,820
and 80s brought first The Innovation and

113
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,340
then the massification the spread of ICT

114
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,800
technology so different modes of

115
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,419
different instruments of

116
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,419
telecommunications and also a big

117
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,380
development of Aviation of air which was

118
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,900
used both I mean of course it existed

119
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,720
already in 1930s 40s and 50s but it's in

120
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,720
the 1970s that it really became a common

121
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,419
or more common than ever way of for

122
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,580
people to move around to travel of

123
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,620
course not within the city but between

124
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,900
cities between countries and also to

125
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,880
move Goods so this really propelled uh

126
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
or gave constituted a really big step in

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,340
terms of globalizing both traffic of

128
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,639
people as and and of goods of trade

129
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,340
and that's coincided with a general

130
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,660
shift from industrial to service economy

131
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,340
ongoing supervisation of not only

132
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,280
housing but also a number of other

133
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,240
economic functions that were

134
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,800
traditionally related to memory course

135
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,199
also going to do the suburbs which

136
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,220
created a polycentric

137
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,900
mosaic-like patterns of suburbanization

138
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,880
so the suburbs were no longer these

139
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,320
residential areas from which people

140
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,300
commuted to the city center but actually

141
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,300
a lot of jobs a lot of productive

142
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,100
activity and service economy would start

143
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,139
being located in in the suburbs

144
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,340
themselves

145
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,080
uh so creating all kinds of

146
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,020
constellations which for example could

147
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,000
be called the Suburban downtowns or Edge

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,620
cities that comes from the work of

149
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,960
famous geographer and Soldier uh

150
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,639
analyzing the development of Los Angeles

151
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,479
in the 1980s and the 1990s

152
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,280
the Paradigm of this could be seen I

153
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,020
mean or the symbol not a paradigm of

154
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,360
this transformation could be seen in the

155
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,000
particular space or a type of space of

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,060
an airport if back in the 1970s as you

157
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,800
can see in this image the airport would

158
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,560
be a very functional Place uh a place of

159
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,160
arrival a departure and a rather small

160
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,819
area would be devoted to the airport

161
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,860
this over of course a number of decades

162
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,139
has completely changed so you see that

163
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,759
development of one of the most important

164
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,740
efforts in the world's Hip Roll which is

165
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,139
the airport of Amsterdam

166
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,780
uh what's very important here is that

167
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,880
the airport it's no longer an addition

168
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,699
to the city but actually increasingly a

169
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,000
central space around which or in

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,520
relation to which the city develops so

171
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,380
what kind of a city a city what kind of

172
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,660
an Oakwood city has uh has a

173
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,160
repercussions in terms of what kind of

174
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,259
class of investors and productive

175
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,960
activities it can attract to have an

176
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,900
importance in airport Hub is

177
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,240
increasingly only well it's already a

178
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,860
well-established point of the agenda of

179
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,039
open marketing of Urban Development

180
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,780
um and airports are no longer just

181
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,580
airports I mean you can see here in the

182
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,039
slide that around sleepwell we've got a

183
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,720
number of other activities so a business

184
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,440
district office spaces uh residential

185
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,880
Hotel so it is uh sort of neighborhood

186
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,639
in itself that is built around the the

187
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,139
airport

188
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,699
um itself

189
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,639
this is important why is it why is it is

190
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,660
important

191
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,819
well there was a number of things at

192
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,199
stake here but the most important thing

193
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,199
here is that this change of typology of

194
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,580
different spaces in relation to these

195
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,240
different modes of travel so coming into

196
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,699
telecommunications Aviation means that

197
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,319
the travel contents are becoming more

198
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,419
and more complex

199
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,819
um the globalization of world economy

200
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,919
and the centrality of the city and this

201
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,199
global economy means that there is a

202
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,599
number of productive activities jobs

203
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,020
basically that happen 24 7. it's the

204
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,180
Paradigm of going to uh I mean of most

205
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,460
people going to work at eight o'clock

206
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,720
nine o'clock in the morning and then

207
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,160
going back in the afternoon of course

208
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,259
it's a lot of people still do that but

209
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,000
there is plenty of jobs that happen

210
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,280
overnight that require

211
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
transport infrastructure that is

212
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,380
provided in places and at times that

213
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,839
we're not needed there was no demand for

214
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,039
in the past

215
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,719
so in our

216
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,520
in us this

217
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,279
making of those Urban economy more

218
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,740
flexible uh and more precarious has

219
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,240
repercussions in terms of making

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,040
transport and Mobility also much more

221
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,320
flexible or the demand for much more

222
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,779
flexible way of moving which of course

223
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,880
means that it's way more complicated and

224
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,220
way more difficult to design Transport

225
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,040
Systems than before since people move if

226
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,140
we can put it in a very blunt way in in

227
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,820
much more complicated ways than ever

228
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,740
before at very different times in a

229
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,660
different stasis just to give you an

230
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,100
example I mean traditionally

231
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,959
reserventence of the airport of Brussels

232
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,300
will be considered of course as a very

233
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,160
important space that'll have to be

234
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,080
connected to the city primarily to

235
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,839
receive passengers there and from and

236
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,760
increasingly a random area of the city

237
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,260
and I think you covered that with David

238
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,779
White's uh in quite in detail there's a

239
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,640
whole Hub of business and productive

240
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,459
activity which of course attracts a lot

241
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,260
of middle class workers who would go to

242
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,440
that area daytime but then the

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,940
development of ongoing development of

244
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,220
the city sorry of the airport means that

245
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,300
there is

246
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,220
um high demand for workers in logistics

247
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,839
for example who have to arrive at the

248
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,160
airport at three o'clock in the morning

249
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,260
which raises questions in terms of

250
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,640
provision of public transport through

251
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,260
that area a lot of these people would

252
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,760
for example reside in working-class

253
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,260
neighborhoods of Brussels

254
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,580
so

255
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,920
um there is a question with a nighttime

256
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,600
public transport should be provided to

257
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,100
that area

258
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,660
um but then and get a current Paradigm

259
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,820
of public transport by Time by night

260
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,100
time in Brussels this mode of Transport

261
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,779
is mostly provided for leisure

262
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,180
activities so for people who go out

263
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,760
enjoy cultural activities or socializing

264
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,500
and then want to go back home at two

265
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,779
o'clock three o'clock in the night but

266
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,040
not for people who actually need to

267
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,920
reach their their jobs at that time of

268
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,279
the of the night in very let's say weird

269
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,060
or previously not so present areas such

270
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,640
as the the savitem area or other

271
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,839
localities around us that hack okay

272
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,399
so having said this uh so a quick

273
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,440
reminder of what we did last time and a

274
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,240
quick

275
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,579
uh cover of this shift from for this to

276
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,320
post four days in Paradigm of uh of

277
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,820
Urban Development and its repercussions

278
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,120
for for the cities uh and and transport

279
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,200
in them

280
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,899
here's what we are going to do today so

281
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,500
we will discuss uh perhaps have a little

282
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,060
discussion actually I will be trying to

283
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,920
ask you some questions and engage in

284
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,779
some exchange here

285
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,240
what is the sustainable Urban transport

286
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,100
and different sustainable perspectives

287
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,459
on imagining transport and developing it

288
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,800
and then we will engage in a progressive

289
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,440
deconstruction of that Paradigm and

290
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,600
analyze what we can identify as critical

291
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,339
approaches to transported Mobility that

292
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,899
built on a number of perspectives that

293
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,260
you already heard from David and bass

294
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,200
and Nick about

295
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,320
all right last week what you had to do

296
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,120
and many other things that an article

297
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,320
you had to do as students of Master

298
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,779
nerve and studies and geography is to

299
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,000
read a paper by David bannister on on

300
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160
sustainable Mobility paradigm

301
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,240
um I wonder where they used to remember

302
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,640
anything from that paper this is not an

303
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,740
exam so don't worry if you remember

304
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,959
things that were not exactly you know

305
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,399
um I mean what you remember isn't

306
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,079
exactly carry clear maybe things a

307
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,540
little bit fuzzy but

308
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,040
does something ring a bell from that

309
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,540
from that piece

310
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,220
um if you if somebody asked you today

311
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,500
before this particular lecture what is

312
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,899
sustainable Urban transport what comes

313
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,060
to mind does anybody want to uh want to

314
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,500
share their thoughts on this with us

315
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
that's called awkward silence

316
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,480
foreign

317
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,980
does anybody remember what banister says

318
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,339
in this paper

319
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,800
that's all right

320
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:39,000
okay well

321
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,420
it's not how to put it it's not the most

322
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,579
um fascinating paper I've ever read but

323
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,339
for transport geography it's absolutely

324
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,899
fundamental so this is really something

325
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,800
that

326
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,200
you see being referred to for when was

327
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,220
it written 2011 right so nine years in

328
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,260
this is still a very very important

329
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,380
piece of writing that really defined

330
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,440
almost a whole field of research and

331
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,720
transport and Mobility

332
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,660
what's important here and this is

333
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,399
important when we keep thinking about

334
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,680
the last lecture in the neoclassical

335
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,100
Paradigm of uh of developing transport

336
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,220
is well could be summarized in a number

337
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,399
of points so if you think about this uh

338
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,600
image that I showed you from the Corpus

339
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,700
here and this modernist rational

340
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,740
approach to planning cities around

341
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,500
transport or

342
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,839
here the assumption is that we have to

343
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,100
ultimately break with this

344
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,079
monofunctional planning separation of

345
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,260
functions keeping residential areas on

346
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,779
the one side and productive activity

347
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,600
jobs offices industrial activity on the

348
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
other side and then Leisure somewhere in

349
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,380
between these three in the in between

350
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,360
these two here the idea is that we

351
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440
really have to engage in planning cities

352
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,240
that are much more mixed which different

353
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,000
functions are

354
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,079
allocated much more closely to each

355
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,600
other why do we have to do that well

356
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,540
because this increases the possibility

357
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,120
of of engaging Less in mobility of

358
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,540
basically in moving less in the in the

359
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,860
city which has of course very good

360
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,540
implications or potentially good

361
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,620
implications in terms of the

362
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,540
environmental impact of transform

363
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,820
so the idea is that if we make cities

364
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,100
more mixed in terms of the functions and

365
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,139
on top of that more dense we might

366
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,600
arrive at the situation in which people

367
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,339
don't have to travel such far distances

368
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:30,920
or they don't have to travel that often

369
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,180
and potentially and that's the second

370
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,820
point we can also facilitate some kind

371
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,700
of a shift from the mode that we all

372
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,040
want to disappear I mean I'm thinking as

373
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,660
a sustainable Urban transport planner

374
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,519
now so the car towards public transport

375
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,959
Collective Mobility on the one hand and

376
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,160
on the other hand

377
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,680
so-called soft transport mode so walking

378
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,920
cycling to profoundly Challenge and

379
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,260
hopefully end the domination of cars in

380
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,360
in cities like

381
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,279
so this is I mean goes beyond the

382
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,360
critique of the car uh how do we maybe

383
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,100
not get rid of the car but how limited

384
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,560
how do we limit its presence well we

385
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,959
make cities more dense more mixed and we

386
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,160
make public transport and other

387
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,199
different modes of of moving around more

388
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,519
attractive

389
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,440
well of course there are important

390
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,899
cultural and social barriers to this so

391
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,000
there is some kind of social inertia and

392
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
you mentioned it in our discussion at

393
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
the end of the last lecture people are

394
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,459
used to driving the they of course have

395
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,260
been also told for a couple of decades

396
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,899
now that uh I mean buying a car is

397
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,699
something not only perfectly normal but

398
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,459
maybe in context such as Belgium or

399
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,579
Brussels a perfectly rational choice

400
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,860
and also well if we follow the

401
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,600
neoclassical line I mean people make

402
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,779
rational economic choices uh so it's

403
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,639
been simply quite profitable and and

404
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,120
economically reasonable to have a car so

405
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,279
to instigate some kind of a social

406
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,139
transformation we need to pay more

407
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,360
attention to how people make these

408
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,579
choices and this perspective starts

409
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,040
adding a number of psychological

410
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,779
analysis for example and factors to this

411
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,940
to this equation so it's not only an

412
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,940
economic uh choice and some kind of an

413
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,040
economic decision that people make when

414
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,660
they take a car or some other amount of

415
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,120
Transport but there's also

416
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,779
um

417
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,300
different social aspects psychological

418
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,180
aspects that impact and make an impact

419
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,339
on this and this means that sustainable

420
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,560
Urban transport Scholars planners

421
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,500
activists are much more attentive than

422
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,120
the neoclassical colleagues in terms of

423
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
how people engage in different

424
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,560
Lifestyles why do they practice certain

425
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,740
travel behaviors it is called which also

426
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,259
leads to a lot of studies on inclusion

427
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,940
in transport or exclusion from it on

428
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,399
accessibility two different transport

429
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,560
modes or accessibility through transport

430
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,019
to different Urban functions which

431
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,139
progressively over the you know 1990s

432
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,320
2000s and up to today questions this

433
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,300
Paradigm of of seems to question this

434
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,420
Paradigm of top-down planning and and

435
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,319
policy so this figure of some

436
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,199
neoclassical rational expert is not

437
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,640
necessarily

438
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,040
um well it's still there but it's not

439
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,740
the only god-like figure that makes

440
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,559
these like decisions in terms of you

441
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,179
know here we will build a Motorway and

442
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,699
he will build some residential uh

443
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,339
neighborhood etc etc

444
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,859
where is the city in this in this

445
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,780
Paradigm or in this perspective

446
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,299
well the city is

447
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,299
um

448
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,100
an outcome of the sustainable transport

449
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,039
Paradigm it's a sustainable transport in

450
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,500
the sustainable city is is an in it's an

451
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,240
integral component

452
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,780
um of what uh what Jacob's called good

453
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,000
City on what David bannister in the

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,940
article you had to read uh identifies as

455
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,620
Urban viability vibrancy Vitality there

456
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,820
was a lot of uh words about a lot of um

457
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,059
writing about uh the the attractiveness

458
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,919
of the city or its livability or its

459
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,140
resilience that's a bit more recent so

460
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,419
there's a lot of keywords which identify

461
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,419
uh a city as

462
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,080
um

463
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,660
ultimate benefactor of the shift towards

464
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,640
sustainable transport so there is talk

465
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,100
about maintaining economic performance

466
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,900
of the city since well we remember that

467
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,660
neoclassical Scholars have essentially

468
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,460
tried to theorize this relationship

469
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,440
between economic growth and development

470
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,360
of Transport so it's still there we move

471
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,820
away from the car but the cities still

472
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,320
continue to develop the economies

473
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,360
continue to thrive we achieve social

474
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,240
cohesion so presumably everybody is on

475
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,980
board there is no Losers of this process

476
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,600
it's all of course environmentally

477
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,900
friendly we arrive at Urban environments

478
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,720
which provide Better Health environments

479
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,580
or facilities well not facilities but

480
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,200
are basically more healthy for the for

481
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,480
the residents and all this in the spirit

482
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,940
of participation so everybody is on

483
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,380
board and and

484
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,020
this political process does not exclude

485
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,860
anybody well if you think about this uh

486
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,460
I mean I'm no my intention is not to be

487
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,320
ironic here I think that

488
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,120
um by the way the slide I mean the image

489
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,919
here is from uh this visualization of uh

490
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,960
in Brussels so the central uh

491
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,480
Avenue that crosses the Pentagon from

492
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,520
north to south and if you remember how

493
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,280
this this street looked like some years

494
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,600
ago

495
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
um this kind of vision is something that

496
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,500
we might all you know want to subscribe

497
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
to I mean who doesn't want to live in a

498
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,919
city that is all these things

499
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,660
economically performing socially

500
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,340
cohesive environmentally friendly I mean

501
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,919
it's a perfect City it sees

502
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,799
um the problem is well before we move to

503
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,940
the problem

504
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,039
um there are a few

505
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,020
I'm sure that this rings a bell and I'm

506
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,220
sure that you know a lot of different

507
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,620
practices which are trying to policies

508
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,260
practices that are trying to achieve

509
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,580
these things to make the city more

510
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,200
environmentally friendly in terms of its

511
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,120
transport economically performance

512
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,520
inclusive cohesive and whatnot

513
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,660
it's what examples you know so this is

514
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,059
maybe an easy question to answer

515
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,799
compared to the previous one

516
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,020
does anybody know any practices of

517
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,120
sustainable transport basically is it my

518
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,360
question

519
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,840
because you can see that the

520
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,080
construction of bike lanes for example

521
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,520
yes very much so I mean it's a

522
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,440
promoting a different mode of Transport

523
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,880
than the cars right one of the soft

524
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,460
modes cycling so we absolutely yes

525
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,880
what else

526
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,419
I see it enter

527
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,340
um I'm living uh

528
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,100
here next to it about one kilometer of

529
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,320
the Opera in antrop

530
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,419
and um

531
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,240
two years ago it was uh

532
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,220
for um

533
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,559
passengers

534
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,260
very difficult to cross the roads and

535
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,280
now

536
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,780
um they made a tunnel

537
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,020
and they made a huge space for um carbon

538
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,340
transport and and passengers so

539
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,320
you can see now and then

540
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,480
a big difference

541
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,799
um clear division from from what's

542
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,520
what's usual until the 90s so you mean

543
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,000
that there was less space of well of the

544
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,840
car infrastructure

545
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,179
by public transport

546
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,039
yeah

547
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,799
the the car was was still

548
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,740
um like they say it was the boss

549
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,799
um right presence of the of the car was

550
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,320
was very important we seen our shift

551
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,880
there

552
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,000
and this shift basically consists of

553
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,620
creating some infrastructure for

554
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,299
pedestrians and public transports to

555
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,720
somehow public schools now for a meeting

556
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,200
place uh for the Opera okay okay

557
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,220
to this

558
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,320
um can you hear me yeah I just just

559
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,299
right before the lecture I I read about

560
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,280
Paris with a more

561
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,220
um restrictive policy about banning

562
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,460
um your parking spots in cities in in

563
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,400
order to achieve the 50 minutes uh City

564
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,640
the so-called so-called Fatima City yeah

565
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,700
right so restricting restricting car

566
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,799
infrastructure or transforming it into

567
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
different type of infrastructure for

568
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,179
either either different modes or for

569
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,820
pedestrians so creating some Urban space

570
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,159
okay

571
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,520
what else maybe developing both rapid

572
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,280
transits for example in America

573
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,860
yeah does everybody or is this somebody

574
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,480
who doesn't know what bus Rapid Transit

575
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,600
is

576
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,360
it's a funny question to ask to a screen

577
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,720
but oh no don't tell me that it's

578
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,460
switched again I have to stop sharing

579
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,500
your screen but perhaps you want to

580
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,480
explain what bus Rapid Transit is

581
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,620
because I'm sure that there is somebody

582
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,299
who doesn't know

583
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,179
I can help in case

584
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,580
your definition is not perfect well what

585
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,840
it has

586
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,960
yeah yeah you know what I have as an

587
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,440
example is these lanes that the just for

588
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,919
bosses so they're developer a rapid Lane

589
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,159
that it will only go for buses so it's

590
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,020
supposed to work better around the city

591
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,820
yeah

592
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,039
yeah it's essentially creating separate

593
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,640
lanes for for buses but what's quite

594
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,380
specific about this or quite particular

595
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,760
is that it's

596
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,760
um kind of imitates or replaces an

597
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,260
underground system so a Metro system

598
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,539
which

599
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,700
is of course very expensive to build so

600
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,159
the idea is that instead of engaging in

601
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,720
all this digging and creating this very

602
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,360
costly and an invasive infrastructure

603
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,799
you can just create some separate lanes

604
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,140
for the buses and have an efficient

605
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,880
public transport system which is Metro

606
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,960
like

607
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,900
and that's I want to say common but uh

608
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,900
well a lot of cases first emerge in in

609
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,520
the global South right so in South

610
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,220
America and then in South Africa

611
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,440
um but there are also cases in in global

612
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
North in Western Europe

613
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,179
okay there is a lot of these different

614
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,520
policies and a lot of different

615
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,720
um

616
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,820
a lot of different uh practices and

617
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,900
ideas it seems so let's quickly go over

618
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,000
I mean let's let's try to put them

619
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,340
together into some kind of coherent uh

620
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,820
typology of different things that cities

621
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,039
can do in order to make this transport

622
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,380
more sustainable so the first thing is

623
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,059
to tackle the problem right so if the

624
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,400
problem is the car then how do we deal

625
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,500
with the car well we can either improve

626
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,860
the technology of the car and this means

627
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,220
um reducing emissions making it

628
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,260
contaminate the air a little bit less so

629
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,960
cleaning the engine technology

630
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,299
substituting for of petrol diesel

631
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,700
vehicles by electric vehicles or biogas

632
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,640
or whatnot uh creating the con I mean

633
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,500
changing the construction of cars so

634
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,860
that they cause less casualties in in

635
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,780
case of accidents right so this is

636
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,280
something that today we take for granted

637
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,220
that cars have these um crash zones and

638
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,620
crashes are being done safety tests but

639
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,480
this was virtually non-existent in the

640
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,520
1970s or 80s

641
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,320
so that's one thing so basically it's

642
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,940
trying to make the car a better vehicle

643
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,200
for the city

644
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,480
well here in the immediate problem is

645
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,659
that I mentioned that last time uh among

646
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,659
the type of vehicles that see a number

647
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,779
of sales go up most I mean most rapidly

648
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,179
in last two or three years are SUVs so

649
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,520
the sports utility vehicles which are

650
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,980
basically these massive jeep-like uh

651
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,840
cars which are extremely dangerous for

652
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,120
pedestrians and if you also turn to one

653
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,360
of the most important or marketized

654
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,000
inventors of Transport technology Elon

655
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,039
Musk I mean it's a guy who does electric

656
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,320
cars but also if you paid attention to

657
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,940
that I don't know if you know if you

658
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,980
notice that in the news I think it was

659
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,200
early this year or last year that he

660
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,020
produced this massive truck uh like

661
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,760
American style you know pickup truck

662
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,700
which has not been tested in terms of

663
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,559
its impact on pedestrians in case it

664
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,900
actually clashes with one but there is

665
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,880
on the one hand the industry tries to

666
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,919
reinvent the vehicles to make them more

667
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,840
safe and environmentally friendly on the

668
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,039
other hand there is still a push for

669
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,919
creating gigantic vehicles with simply

670
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,500
cannot achieve that with the size and

671
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,539
the you know its audience or the

672
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,220
audience is not simply looking for this

673
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,159
okay so that's the car another thing

674
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,380
that of course can be done is uh to

675
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,000
restrict the accessibility for the car

676
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,480
uh to the to the city as a whole or to

677
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,620
its different

678
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,220
um areas specific zones right so we can

679
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,919
for example impose these restrictive

680
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:01,440
pricing instruments such as congestion

681
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,100
charging or Powers which was stolen in

682
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,500
Dutch which was very recently announced

683
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,720
in Brussels but it existed in in several

684
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,460
other

685
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,720
Belgian cities in one form or another

686
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,059
for for quite a while now

687
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,700
um we can think of reducing physically

688
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,500
the space for the car so basically

689
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,559
making uh roads more narrow so so

690
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,900
cutting some Lanes reducing the number

691
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,440
of parking areas and then uh as it was

692
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,960
mentioned uh earlier replacing this

693
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,880
infrastructure is replacing the space

694
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,940
with other users so opening this space

695
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,500
to for example pedestrians or

696
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,659
non-motorized traffic creating these

697
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,640
so-called pedestrian zones or shared

698
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,720
spaces and here you have one from London

699
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,100
in this slide and also the famous

700
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,720
congestion charging scheme in London

701
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
which means that in a specific Central

702
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,700
area of London you pay 12 pounds to

703
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,600
enter every time you you do that right

704
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,760
okay

705
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,740
what other things can be done to tackle

706
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,380
a lot of Mobility well of course if we

707
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,720
want the presence of the car to go down

708
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,700
we need to propose some alternative to

709
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,799
the car our obvious alternative is

710
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,200
public transport and here sustainable

711
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,960
perspectives on transport basically uh

712
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,820
keep emphasizing the importance of

713
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,840
increasing the quality of public

714
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,100
transport of increasing the

715
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,279
accessibility of public transport

716
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:25,380
across the urban or Suburban space and

717
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,080
indeed fast Rapid Transit is one common

718
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,360
example of how this can be done actually

719
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,020
quite inexpensively also the

720
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,279
reinstallation of urban trumps and many

721
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,679
cities in the global North that got rid

722
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,320
of the tram uh to create space for the

723
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,480
car if you remember my slice from from

724
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,700
last time that's what partly happened in

725
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,760
Brussels in the 1970s it's a very common

726
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,740
way it was a very common phenomenon

727
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,200
common phenomenon sorry in France where

728
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,299
a lot of cities Trump's Trump network

729
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,700
was quite simply dismantled so here

730
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,340
since the 1990s 2000s we see The Return

731
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,279
of the Trump Urban funicular so creating

732
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,380
these cable cars plenty of other modes

733
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,720
basically of public transport and also

734
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,279
promoting the notion

735
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,740
of multi-modality right so creating

736
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,539
different options for users so that they

737
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,059
don't have to Simply choose between the

738
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,320
car and something else but there's

739
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,899
something else is a variety of different

740
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,059
options from which one can choose and

741
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,980
depending on where they go with whom

742
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,460
what they feel uh like like using in a

743
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,779
particular moment of time what

744
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,120
corresponds better to the behavior do

745
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,159
they to their lifestyle right if we if

746
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,779
the lifestyle and behavior is what we

747
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,520
pay attention to much more than before

748
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,179
um and then finally what's important in

749
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,000
this portfolio of different solutions or

750
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,340
tools if you will is reducing the need

751
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,960
to travel right so I mentioned already

752
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,000
that here the idea is that we make

753
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
cities more dense more mixed so perhaps

754
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,279
we don't have to travel so often and so

755
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,460
far

756
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,220
and in planning or in geography the idea

757
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,760
here is to progressively link Urban

758
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
Development with transport development

759
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,000
so the idea of Transit Oriental

760
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,980
transport oriented development

761
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,559
emerged within this Paradigm so for

762
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,140
example fostering some activities some

763
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,640
development around the development of

764
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,559
new Metro stations or Railway stations

765
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,200
or whole transport corridors a little

766
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,580
bit like what I showed you last time

767
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,620
with Copenhagen right the finger the

768
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,360
five finger plant which was one of the

769
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,240
first ideas of linking transport

770
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,059
development and Urban Development

771
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:34,980
um and many other things that's well

772
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,080
quite frankly I'm much more interested

773
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,059
in in sharing with you the critique of

774
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,940
all this than than this itself because

775
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,700
this is very easy to find and there's

776
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,380
plenty of different Publications on this

777
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,020
I mean basically if you follow any of

778
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,779
these uh websites which deal with or

779
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,399
well these are called magazines these

780
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,279
days that follow uh Urban policy City

781
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,640
lab the Atlantic fox or whatnot I'm sure

782
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,260
that you know more than I do I mean this

783
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,760
is what they say I mean this is what

784
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,580
they promote a lot right so the car is

785
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,299
the problem so anytime a big Northern

786
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,820
also in the global South uh this is

787
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,340
picked up a little bit but anytime any

788
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,720
important city does something in terms

789
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,179
of curbing automobility

790
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,640
um this is very often picked up by this

791
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,340
kind of media and hails as a radical

792
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,039
intervention as a radical step to to

793
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,559
reinvent Humanity to give cities back to

794
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,299
the people to make cities more

795
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,059
sustainable green attractive and etc etc

796
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,340
now I'm not saying that this is all bad

797
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,100
and that this is uh you know problematic

798
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,720
in itself but there is a number of

799
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,760
critical questions that answers critical

800
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,620
geographers really need to be asking

801
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,240
about these practices because they quite

802
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,559
simply

803
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,720
um well they are they are not really

804
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,700
taking full stock of the complexity of

805
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,679
cities that they're being applied in

806
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,120
for one

807
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,980
so

808
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,740
um well the first immediate problem is

809
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,200
that the word sustainability or the term

810
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,779
sustainability has already been picked

811
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:07,020
up by the industry the Paradigm that

812
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,159
sustainability in principle wanted to to

813
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,860
criticize and to have some critical

814
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,480
Cutting Edge over

815
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,100
so for instance the the oil industry and

816
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,620
the car industry both claim to be

817
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,179
extremely sustainable these days right

818
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,399
in terms of how they produce soil and in

819
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,020
terms of how they produce vehicles I

820
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,460
mentioned already this idea of

821
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,620
Reinventing the car so it's a more

822
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,860
sustainable mode of travel in in cities

823
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,080
but the deeper problem is that

824
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,059
and I will show that in a moment that

825
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,100
the kind of questions that sustainable

826
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,620
Urban paradigm

827
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,659
um asks about the city and the solutions

828
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,419
that it tries to bring are essentially I

829
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:51,779
mean they can only reveal some transport

830
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,720
reality to a point so it's very quick I

831
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,039
think that we can reach some kind of a

832
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,240
wall

833
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,120
um and this debate between let's say the

834
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,159
neoclassical engineers and economists

835
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,159
and the anti-car proponents of

836
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,620
sustainable vanities it's not a very

837
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,120
productive one

838
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,880
and very importantly for this course and

839
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,559
for you is I don't know Urban

840
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,179
geographers urban planners of the future

841
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,399
the relation between transport and the

842
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,860
urban in this debate is very it's very

843
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,440
weak so conceptually but also

844
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,820
empirically

845
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,320
um this kind of thinking about

846
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,179
transported Mobility simply does not

847
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,340
tell us a lot I think about the city

848
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,120
which is why we're here two nights

849
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,820
right so so let's deconstruct it and

850
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,100
explore some critical stuff about it

851
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,159
basically so

852
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,380
I wonder whether you can already pick up

853
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,260
some critique of this from Elena and her

854
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,039
colleague

855
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,399
I'll be starving with the readings today

856
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,140
does anybody remember something from the

857
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,679
reading for today

858
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,720
um I do

859
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,980
it's been a week since I read it

860
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,299
but uh

861
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,260
um I know that she uh has like

862
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,219
identified two main principles of

863
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,780
critique

864
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,520
which is first that the Alternatives

865
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,300
that are being proposed by um the

866
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,119
automobile industry and no specific

867
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,820
plans they are not very

868
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,599
like sufficient in reducing the uh out

869
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,000
to mobile impact

870
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,199
um in in certain cases you can you can

871
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,960
say if I uh say something wrong and then

872
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,000
secondly

873
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,159
um

874
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,000
well it's it's sort of a very exclusive

875
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,820
uh sometimes discussion I think but uh

876
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,520
yeah it's not very present anymore but I

877
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,980
would like to pose another question for

878
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,200
that paper it kind of upset me in a way

879
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,920
oh yeah

880
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,760
yeah if we're at it like uh I basically

881
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,460
I liked her way of like introducing her

882
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,200
thoughts and like structuring the paper

883
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,540
but I was a bit like put off just uh

884
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,300
methodologically uh in the way that she

885
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:27,020
uh links empirical evidence that she

886
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,380
produced herself to theory that is

887
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,060
oftentimes very theoretical and like

888
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,760
um based on uh very uh personal beliefs

889
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,359
and attitudes which I like also support

890
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,359
in a way but sometimes I found that did

891
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,000
make her arguments less striking and I

892
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,800
was just wondering because we are like

893
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,900
still in the beginning of all of our

894
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,680
like uh Urban critical research careers

895
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,500
uh how that is to be done

896
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,940
uh

897
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,700
if you have an answer to that

898
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,440
I don't know I mean I don't have an

899
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,079
answer to that question

900
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,300
um well I would agree with you that

901
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,859
maybe methodologically this is not the

902
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:19,500
strongest paper uh it's an analysis of

903
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,300
plans and it's not very clear exactly

904
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,740
what she's maybe done with this and

905
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,079
maybe it's true that her conviction is a

906
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,760
little bit stronger than her empirics in

907
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,140
this particular paper

908
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,619
um I picked it because it summarizes a

909
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,180
few things a little bit better than than

910
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,480
others but I really like what she what

911
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,940
she what she does even though the best

912
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,859
work that she's done is in French I

913
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,079
think which makes it not accessible to

914
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,240
everybody here

915
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,140
um

916
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,760
but yeah I think your first point in

917
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,380
terms of what's you know what's in the

918
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,380
article it's it's spot on it's also

919
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,380
there in the title I mean uh she may be

920
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,800
uh it's again she risks uh being maybe a

921
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,960
little bit uh engaging in some kind of

922
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,900
exaggeration right it's not every single

923
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,880
sustainable Urban transport policy that

924
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,980
leads to the processes that she

925
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,460
describes but there is a tendency for

926
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,359
these policies to create some

927
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,740
inequalities

928
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,680
and for the politicizing the debate

929
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,820
so um it's not exactly clear who these

930
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,220
policies are supposed to be for they are

931
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,520
these obvious a little bit again in this

932
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,859
kind of neoclassical uh Direction

933
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:32,280
rational tools of now dealing with uh

934
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,220
with the car is the problem right so in

935
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,320
fact the power relations in transport or

936
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,700
in transport policy have not really

937
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,280
changed is just that the focus has

938
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,160
shifted significantly and now

939
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,720
um this is what the planners are doing

940
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,220
as opposed to what they were doing in

941
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,420
the 1970s and 80s

942
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,220
um let's dive into this

943
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,780
whoops uh great so what are the and

944
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,300
that's my um individual of how to put it

945
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,180
my personal top five of the reasons why

946
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,160
sustainable Urban transport Paradigm is

947
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,099
not exactly the the you know doesn't

948
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,079
give you a complete view of the

949
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,880
relationship between transport and the

950
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,700
and the city and and also with some I

951
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,160
think quite practical theoretical

952
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,579
empirical uh recipes for how to get out

953
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,380
of this uh roadblock pan unintended so

954
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,599
the first issue with with a lot of the

955
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,400
riding on sustainability is that it's

956
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,260
still very much focused on technology

957
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,180
so there is a lot of attention given to

958
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,760
technological solutions where social and

959
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,900
political Innovations and some bottom up

960
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,579
political activity organization

961
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,820
engagement of people as political agents

962
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,280
not just the consumers and customers

963
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,500
that have to be now convinced to shift

964
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,300
from one mode to another from the car to

965
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,880
something else this is not so present

966
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,000
and uh well this comes from the from the

967
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,540
guru himself Elon Musk who is um despite

968
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,400
of course some obvious critique it was

969
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,099
his personality and and how he carries

970
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,980
himself in media he still is

971
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,339
um very much the hope for many in terms

972
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:15,000
of transitioning from carbon heavy modes

973
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,099
of Mobility to electric vehicles which

974
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:18,900
according to the industrial are the

975
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,820
thing of the future so according to Elon

976
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,320
Musk

977
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,180
um as he says I think public transport

978
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,820
is painful it sucks why do you want to

979
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,900
get on something with a lot of other

980
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,220
people that doesn't leave where you

981
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,780
wanted to leave doesn't start where you

982
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,660
want it to start doesn't air doesn't end

983
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,160
where you want it to end it's a pain in

984
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,380
the ass and so that's why people like

985
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,180
individualized transport that goes where

986
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,859
you want and when you want

987
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:45,119
so the idea idea is not to engage in

988
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,920
collectivizing transport for example and

989
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,160
making this a more common service or a

990
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,260
more common experience to break not only

991
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,540
the Paradigm of dependency on fossil

992
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,300
fuels and the car but the dependency on

993
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,800
individual transport making this

994
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,040
basically a less individual activity

995
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,260
which is a social political activity as

996
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,660
well no to the country here the idea is

997
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,520
to develop a better technology within

998
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,320
the Paranormal individual transport and

999
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,180
Elon Musk I mean he's doing a lot of

1000
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,359
things but one of the other things in

1001
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,040
Tesla and the produced production of

1002
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,040
electric vehicles that he does is

1003
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,560
um boring tunnels on the Los Angeles to

1004
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,079
basically create some parallel Motorway

1005
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,000
system if we can call it this way that

1006
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
bypasses congestion so actually the

1007
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,280
focus here while

1008
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,440
um might apparently be on making trans

1009
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,140
more sustainable it is essentially to

1010
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,880
solve congestion which is an extremely

1011
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,800
as I explained last time neoclastical

1012
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,619
formulation of the problem

1013
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,099
another issue and that's from Elena's

1014
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,980
paper and but I think it's not from the

1015
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,300
one that you had to read for today but

1016
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,220
from another thing that I that I learned

1017
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,339
from here is this focus on on

1018
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:02,760
the individual as the not only well how

1019
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,859
to put it not only is the source of a

1020
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,020
number of Transport problems but also as

1021
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,060
a as a solution to to address these

1022
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,920
problems right so

1023
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,940
the idea here is that essentially we can

1024
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,520
convince people to change the habits to

1025
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,320
change the lifestyle related to

1026
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,079
transported mobility and in this way we

1027
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,760
can solve a number of issues related to

1028
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,359
to this uh to this field of of open

1029
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,680
Planning of urban policies

1030
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,680
um

1031
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,920
which means that within the sustainable

1032
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,240
Paradigm

1033
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,040
um a lot of policy makers a lot of

1034
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,920
Transport stakeholders would uh rather

1035
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,720
than engage in the politics of Transport

1036
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,339
they would engage on the pedagogy that's

1037
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:48,060
related to it so it's suddenly the

1038
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,760
challenge is to make sure that people

1039
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,520
engage Less in behavior that is

1040
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,500
identified as bad behavior for example

1041
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,380
driving or living in the suburbs flying

1042
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,859
around and switching to what is

1043
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:03,780
considered to be good type of behavior

1044
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,880
positive behavior so cycling around

1045
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,220
walking living in a city center living

1046
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,160
in these dense mixed urban areas that

1047
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,079
don't require that you engage in

1048
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,020
mobility and so much

1049
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,880
and while this of course is not a

1050
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,800
problem in itself I mean it's good to

1051
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,339
think of why would people

1052
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,560
um stick to particular ways of moving

1053
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,200
what's very uh detrimental I think to

1054
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,180
the debate and to ultimately solving

1055
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,700
some issues related to transport

1056
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,900
is

1057
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,240
um putting these different ways of

1058
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,619
moving and different behaviors related

1059
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,619
to movement in a coyote where clearly

1060
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,260
there is a moral component so this good

1061
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,880
and bad behavior I think this is

1062
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,339
something that can actually antagonize

1063
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:48,900
people against one another rather than

1064
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,839
try to think of Transport problems as

1065
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,420
common societal problems thus issue

1066
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,400
number one and issue number two is that

1067
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,680
in this discussion about individual

1068
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,180
behavior

1069
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,579
um engagement with analyzing and then

1070
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,440
ultimately addressing structural causes

1071
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,660
behind behind transport and Mobility is

1072
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,480
not so present so if we focus on on the

1073
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,640
question why would people drive

1074
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,980
um and why would people of for example

1075
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,319
even specific ethnicity or gender or

1076
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,079
class drive more than others

1077
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,640
um it is very important to also

1078
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,680
understand what is the structure uh

1079
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,359
behind this what is the the general

1080
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,819
policy that allows people to obtain

1081
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,760
access to uh to a vehicle that allows

1082
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,520
that are of car infrastructure which

1083
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,839
very often and that's the case

1084
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,940
definitely in Belgium it's often

1085
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,940
absolutely free to use with no taxes to

1086
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,720
to use motorways or with cheap parking

1087
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,920
etc etc

1088
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,980
so this perspective is

1089
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,020
um in itself not a problem to look at

1090
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,000
you know why people engage in particular

1091
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,339
type of behavior and not other

1092
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,720
um but it's very important to also

1093
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,980
understand the structures behind this

1094
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,440
what Elena also writes a lot about and

1095
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,020
many others as well but as I said I'm

1096
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,339
really quite convinced by by her writing

1097
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:09,119
um

1098
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,880
is the uneven geography that is being

1099
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,040
produced by these different uh

1100
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,359
Sustainable Solutions

1101
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,020
somebody's asking a question in the chat

1102
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,640
so let me read that so maybe there's

1103
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,200
something in between for example

1104
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,380
self-driving cars and apps like uber

1105
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,000
um will be able to create smaller

1106
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,260
vehicles that can be shared as public

1107
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,800
transport so in a sense in between but

1108
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,540
in between of

1109
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,280
in between what

1110
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,980
and between private uh I mean including

1111
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,380
individual transport and Collective

1112
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,720
transport you mean

1113
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,300
Rudy do you want to explain whoever you

1114
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,260
are

1115
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,260
foreign

1116
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,520
hello

1117
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,040
Rudy are you with us

1118
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,540
I hope you didn't just write the comment

1119
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,980
and left

1120
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,020
maybe the connection is not very good on

1121
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,880
your end

1122
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,020
um

1123
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,560
well yeah I mean clearly in in recent

1124
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,720
years there's been a rise of uh of

1125
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,700
expectations towards this shared

1126
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,980
Mobility modes right so so a number of

1127
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,140
practices which allow you to get access

1128
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,420
to seemingly collectivized transport

1129
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,760
like uber I mean essentially you don't

1130
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,400
own the vehicle but it's just a not even

1131
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,900
a phone call but a tap on your phone

1132
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,520
away

1133
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,319
um

1134
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:33,900
but there is a number of uh there's a

1135
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,520
number of issues with this so there's a

1136
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,079
question whether this actually replaces

1137
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,500
uh individual transport

1138
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,420
um so do people have less cars because

1139
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,819
Uber is expanding in this city if we're

1140
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:47,400
focusing on Uber in this instance

1141
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,020
um there is also a lot of studies that

1142
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,640
show that Uber actually adds to

1143
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,460
congestion so there is the more Uber

1144
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,619
develops in the city or it's

1145
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,000
um counterparts or different other

1146
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,079
competitive platforms left in China

1147
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,640
there was a huge company called DD that

1148
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,099
essentially does what Uber does

1149
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,380
um so the more these companies develop

1150
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,400
in your city the more the how do you

1151
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,480
call it well the total number of

1152
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,260
vehicles the the car stock increases

1153
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,460
which means and that's a problem in a

1154
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,560
lot of Chinese cities you basically have

1155
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,980
more traffic jams so these cars are in

1156
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,240
traffic all the time they keep looking

1157
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,819
for customers they have to be mobile

1158
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,680
um which means that you add to the

1159
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,960
problem you try yourself which well then

1160
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,599
you try to yourself again adding more to

1161
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,339
these shared platforms

1162
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,680
and also the big issue with Uber if we

1163
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,079
are focusing on this for a moment is

1164
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,339
that the working conditions of course

1165
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:44,220
are quite quite terrible so the idea

1166
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,980
there is that essentially there are

1167
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,240
exceptions to this but in most cities

1168
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,339
where Uber operates

1169
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:51,839
um workers are not really workers

1170
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,839
they're contractors

1171
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,160
which means that they very often go in

1172
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,780
debt to actually get the vehicle that

1173
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,040
they're driving that they have to pay

1174
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,560
back to Uber because it's offering also

1175
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,660
leasing services this means that they

1176
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,740
work very long hours unlike regular taxi

1177
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,900
drivers that have to actually clock in

1178
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,940
and out this is much more regulated in

1179
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,339
terms of how they work for what amount

1180
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:16,260
of time and also what knowledge of the

1181
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,660
city they have I don't know how often

1182
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,160
you've taken Uber in your life but it's

1183
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,040
often the case that these drivers are

1184
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,079
exploring the city alone I mean they

1185
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:28,440
just learn as they as they drive which I

1186
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,359
understand they might come from a very

1187
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:31,800
difficult situation that this is the

1188
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,900
only way for them to get access to a

1189
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,079
more or less decent way of making money

1190
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:39,420
but there's a question of safety there's

1191
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,720
a question of Ethics in terms of

1192
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,880
um inviting such a practice in in our

1193
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,720
cities

1194
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,819
so there are a lot of expectations for

1195
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:49,859
these platforms and indeed there is a

1196
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:52,079
question does this maybe sit between

1197
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,880
public transport Collective transport

1198
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,700
and individual transport but uh

1199
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,440
um I would say that these hopes are

1200
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,839
still not really fulfilled

1201
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:01,800
um

1202
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,540
okay that was a bit of the digression

1203
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,040
let's go back to uneven geography of

1204
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,780
sustainable transport

1205
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,300
so what is the problem here

1206
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,819
um more often than not the application

1207
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:14,900
of the sustainable tools different

1208
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,700
policies infrastructural measures to

1209
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,579
deal with Mobility

1210
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:23,880
uh especially quite exclusive what does

1211
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,500
it mean well

1212
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,380
on the one hand it often happens that a

1213
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,760
lot of these measures are applied in a

1214
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,260
specific area of the city and more often

1215
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,599
than not this is the central Urban core

1216
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,060
which has to be saved from the car in

1217
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,660
which the the car has to limit its

1218
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,839
presence which in no way contradicts uh

1219
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:45,839
or prevents further maintenance at least

1220
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,160
if not developing a further

1221
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,960
infrastructure for the cars in more

1222
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,060
peripheral areas so you can think of

1223
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,859
cities in which in the city center

1224
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:54,540
you've got

1225
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,579
um restrictive parking regulations

1226
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:58,200
you've got a lot of pedestrian areas

1227
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,359
it's simply not easy to drive around

1228
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:02,700
public transport is definitely a more

1229
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,040
logical thing to to do to use to get

1230
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,020
into but the further you go to the

1231
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,579
suburbs the more

1232
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:09,200
um

1233
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,460
multi-lane streets or highways you see

1234
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,740
or actual proper highways a lot of

1235
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,140
parking lots all the infrastructure that

1236
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,839
actually well belongs to the 1970s and

1237
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:20,400
1980s

1238
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,940
and that is I think a situation not only

1239
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,980
in Belgium or and Brussels specifically

1240
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,819
but

1241
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,440
in a lot of these cities that are

1242
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,940
supposedly

1243
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,060
have achieved um a great level of of

1244
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,740
policy in terms of dealing with with

1245
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,339
Khan so Copenhagen Vienna a lot of

1246
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:41,520
French cities that both these uh tram

1247
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,579
renewal programs uh as long as you are

1248
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:46,319
in the central part of the city this all

1249
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,859
looks uh very coherent and very well

1250
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:51,480
inverted Commerce good from a

1251
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,280
sustainable transport perspective but

1252
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,720
the farther you go from the city center

1253
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,640
the more actually the more cars you see

1254
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,500
the more it actually resembles the

1255
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,540
problem that these policies try to try

1256
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,800
to solve

1257
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,920
another inequality is of the vertical

1258
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,339
kind meaning that it often happens that

1259
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:08,880
um

1260
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,619
the investment in these kind of

1261
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,839
sustainable tools comes at the cost of

1262
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:14,880
putting the car infrastructure

1263
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,300
underground so and you can think of any

1264
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,940
case in which pedestrialization of of an

1265
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,579
urban Avenue or Boulevard means that the

1266
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,079
cars have to be put underground or

1267
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:27,780
parking lots of the other highways

1268
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,900
and this is often the the problem in in

1269
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,359
the so-called car-free cities the cities

1270
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,859
that are often picked up by

1271
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:37,079
International media and and praised for

1272
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,359
having addressed head-on the domination

1273
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,040
of the cars and dealt with the problem

1274
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,760
of automobility

1275
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,660
um

1276
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,440
a specific tool that's that I think we

1277
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,900
can see this and even geography in ah

1278
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,000
there's a question in the chat an

1279
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,040
example for Rudy's question from Berlin

1280
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,180
great

1281
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,680
um let me go on with the congestion

1282
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,599
charging while you're discussing Uber in

1283
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,260
the chat uh this is perfectly allowed so

1284
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,540
an example of this and even geography

1285
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,339
can be found in in congestion charging

1286
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:11,220
which is one of the let's say

1287
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,619
um yeah one of the most uh classical

1288
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,079
tools of of sustainable transport

1289
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,760
Paradigm in terms of you know limiting

1290
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,920
the presence of the cars the idea is

1291
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,619
simple it came from Singapore in the

1292
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,440
1970s it was developed as a very

1293
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,880
neoclassical uh tool of planning

1294
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,220
basically a problem with congestion and

1295
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,020
the idea was to convince to encourage

1296
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,200
drivers to use the car off-peak so to

1297
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,720
minimize the the traffic the traffic

1298
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,359
jams in morning and and afternoon or

1299
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,520
evening peak hours

1300
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,059
and progressively this tool or perhaps

1301
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:47,280
with the shift of philosophy behind

1302
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,780
transport from the neoclassical to

1303
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,200
sustainable uh perspectives this tool

1304
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,180
um was picked up by by the sustainable

1305
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,700
narrative and now it not only allows to

1306
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,440
solve congestion but actually it allows

1307
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,240
to limit the presence of the car in the

1308
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,460
city which of course supposedly makes a

1309
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,020
positive impact on on the urban

1310
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,280
environment

1311
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,800
and this tool has been put in place in

1312
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,660
in a number of cities in Europe

1313
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,540
so you here see pictures from Oslo but

1314
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,000
actually this exists in pretty much all

1315
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,180
uh Norwegian cities and towns so a

1316
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,579
system of tolling Gates

1317
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:22,800
um in London which is probably the most

1318
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,599
important or the most known case in

1319
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,240
Europe in Milan but you also have

1320
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,940
similar policies and instruments in

1321
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,460
Stockholm in Sweden and then recently

1322
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,800
also in Brussels announced with a lot of

1323
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,140
pump and Circumstance this idea that now

1324
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,319
it will cost the user the end user money

1325
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,099
to enter with a car Mica to to the

1326
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:45,599
Brussels capital region

1327
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,059
so

1328
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:50,040
while this gets a lot of attention and

1329
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,760
and this policy is discussed as a very

1330
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,480
uh as a very efficient uh tool in terms

1331
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,980
of limiting the presence of the car in

1332
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,020
cities

1333
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,059
um there is questionable evidence I'm

1334
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,520
not saying that this policy is uh is is

1335
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,680
a bad policy or that it never works but

1336
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,579
basically it's it's supposed to uh

1337
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,680
um productive results in terms of

1338
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,920
limiting the car are not exactly there

1339
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,380
in the in the in the in the evidence so

1340
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,300
the results are quite mixed on the one

1341
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,040
hand we see that in in a number of

1342
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,500
Cities traffic of course diminishes but

1343
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,740
since it's The delimited Zone it's it's

1344
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,079
quite particular so it's not the whole

1345
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,240
agglomeration that actually

1346
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,940
um has the access to the car limited we

1347
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,180
see that the traffic often moves from of

1348
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,220
course the The Zone in which the

1349
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,660
condition charging the flight to the

1350
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,819
outer areas in London for instance it's

1351
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:46,859
quite clear that there is significantly

1352
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:49,440
more traffic around that that zone it's

1353
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,079
the same case in Madrid which uh which

1354
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,460
um essentially followed a very similar

1355
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,839
principle

1356
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,540
there is also very questionable evidence

1357
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,460
about what happens with the funds that

1358
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,900
are being raised through these systems

1359
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,880
so while very often these policies are

1360
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,640
put in place with uh this Narrative of

1361
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,559
saving the city from the car of making

1362
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,900
some kind of societal transition to to

1363
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,380
posca society in cities like Oslo or

1364
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,140
London funds from these uh from these

1365
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,480
schemes in in a way that's very clear in

1366
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,680
London maybe a little bit less

1367
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,599
transparent but at least part of these

1368
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,400
fans goes to actually maintenance and

1369
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,200
construction of car infrastructure you

1370
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,579
know it's very it's a very common

1371
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:28,500
practice to put these congestion

1372
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,099
charging areas or

1373
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:33,420
booths if you if you will to actually

1374
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,040
subsidize the construction of of

1375
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,380
specific uh transport infrastructure

1376
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,260
Road tunnel or a bridge it's it's done

1377
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,839
in a very transparent way so in a sense

1378
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,819
it's basically asking the transport the

1379
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:46,260
car user to

1380
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,420
contribute a little bit more because of

1381
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,559
course this contribution is already

1382
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,900
there through tax system to the

1383
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,119
construction uh to the financing of the

1384
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,740
construction of Transport infrastructure

1385
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,140
of cutting in car infrastructure and

1386
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,200
finally the impact of these uh of these

1387
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,319
schemes on overall quality of the city

1388
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,319
not just on air quality in a specific

1389
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:10,200
area is quite limited so

1390
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,400
um

1391
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,220
yeah I said it basically so despite the

1392
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,200
The Narrative of of these practices

1393
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,540
saving Urban environment it's not

1394
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,339
exactly clear that this is this is the

1395
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:22,319
most obvious thing to do to limit the

1396
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,000
smog in the city especially when these

1397
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,280
uh when these areas are quite uh

1398
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,220
spatially Limited

1399
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,079
the problems that immediately emerge

1400
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:33,059
from from policies like congestion

1401
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:36,000
charting is that well it leads to some

1402
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,420
social segregation right so we expect

1403
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,720
um that all people react to this uh to

1404
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,339
this policy in a similar way right they

1405
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:45,660
will reconsider whether they want to

1406
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,099
drive or not whether they want to enter

1407
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,980
into the Zone by car or not but in fact

1408
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,920
of course those who do not pay for the

1409
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,960
vehicle and in particular in Belgium

1410
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,300
this is a policy that is very widespread

1411
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,000
half of new vehicles sold in Belgium are

1412
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,680
so-called company cars which are

1413
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,960
received for free by employees from the

1414
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,540
company as a way of giving them an

1415
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,000
tax-free salary bonus basically so for

1416
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,040
these people who do not pay for the

1417
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,780
vehicle itself and often whose

1418
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,319
consumption of the vehicle gas so or any

1419
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,460
kind of fuel they put in the car

1420
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,079
insurance this is all paid by the

1421
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,180
company very often this very often

1422
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,280
basically is included in the package so

1423
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,660
the congestion charging is actually not

1424
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,579
covered by the individual it's covered

1425
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,859
by the structure that provides the

1426
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:30,059
vehicle

1427
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:32,220
um in in the first place

1428
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,440
while of course those who do not have a

1429
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,260
job who might be seeking one those who

1430
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,619
are from lower working class background

1431
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:43,859
who might also be doing very difficult

1432
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:47,040
complicated irregular trips that require

1433
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,660
entering and leaving in different times

1434
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,180
of day because they need to go to a job

1435
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,880
that that quite simply requires getting

1436
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,040
by car and I'm going back here to this

1437
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,559
example of somebody working in logistics

1438
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,500
public transport between molenberg or

1439
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,119
zavendam for example at three o'clock in

1440
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,160
the morning being simply not there you

1441
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,800
have to have a car to to reach this kind

1442
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,079
of activity to to be able to access the

1443
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,079
kind of urban function

1444
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:15,960
and then ultimately well what it does to

1445
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,800
uh to to Mobility is commodified so it's

1446
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,920
an essentially neoliberal service you

1447
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,140
pay as much as you use it's not a common

1448
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,500
system anymore you the idea is that

1449
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,359
everybody pays not according to the

1450
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:33,480
means but according to the ultimately

1451
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,339
um the price decided by the by the

1452
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:36,780
market

1453
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,339
so

1454
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:40,619
um again not to say that this is about a

1455
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:42,599
good idea but to say that there is quite

1456
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,819
simply a lot of questions a lot of them

1457
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:47,339
quite clearly related to to critical

1458
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:48,599
geography that should be asked about

1459
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,640
these these policies

1460
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,619
it's already past seven so I suggest we

1461
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:54,300
take at least five minute break before

1462
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,160
we can continue so get a little bit of a

1463
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,319
drink uh whatever it is that you are

1464
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,540
you're sipping to make through this

1465
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,160
lecture

1466
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,440
um and I'll see you back in in four five

1467
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,099
minutes all right

1468
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,900
foreign

1469
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:38,819
foreign

1470
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:41,880
okay let's try to resume

1471
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,440
I'm going to share my screen once again

1472
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,339
all right

1473
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:02,359
where are we

1474
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:05,420
all right

1475
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,780
I suppose you hear me and you see me

1476
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,859
um

1477
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:16,859
great perfect so

1478
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:20,040
continuing with uh the uneven geography

1479
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,240
of sustainable transport measures

1480
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:28,260
here you have a very simple or even a

1481
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,900
map more of a scheme that shows a little

1482
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,559
bit how this limitation

1483
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:37,559
plays out in space so Oslo I don't know

1484
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:38,880
if you've heard about that but also is

1485
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,960
one of the most

1486
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,700
um

1487
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,200
marketized cities in terms of its

1488
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,960
alleged fight against the car it's uh

1489
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,619
leading some kind of a war against the

1490
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:51,059
petrol-fueled vehicles and basically

1491
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:53,339
there is this area in the city in which

1492
01:04:53,339 --> 01:04:55,319
um to which access is not only

1493
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:58,380
restricted in terms of extra payment

1494
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,559
right so there was actually several

1495
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:03,359
layers of this congestion charging and

1496
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:06,299
then the final one is this uh Ultra

1497
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:10,440
inner city in which cars propelled by by

1498
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,380
gas or fuel are not allowed is only

1499
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,059
electric vehicles but then when you look

1500
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:16,440
at the whole agglomeration of the city

1501
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,140
it's quite clear that I mean this is a

1502
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,059
very small area so we are actually

1503
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:24,059
talking about quite specific zones of

1504
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:25,680
the city which as I mentioned are

1505
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,380
supposedly saved from the car and are

1506
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:31,559
supposed to be made more pedestrian or

1507
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:33,480
people friendly

1508
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:38,040
same idea or same limitation can be can

1509
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,020
be seen in Madrid which until recently

1510
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,799
had also quite a restrictive uh

1511
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:46,140
Mobility area this has changed with a

1512
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,640
change of political majority does not

1513
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,500
matter if it's this area still exists

1514
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,140
although the rules have have changed to

1515
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,680
some extent the idea is that Madrid

1516
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,980
which was called in worldwide media as

1517
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,200
an anti-car municipality a municipality

1518
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,660
that takes some radical measures to to

1519
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,299
limit the presence of the car in fact

1520
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:08,819
well it does so but it does so within a

1521
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:11,940
quite limited uh

1522
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,000
designated area whereas you see that in

1523
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,400
the in the general map there is a whole

1524
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,260
car infrastructure around it and

1525
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,240
multiple motorways both

1526
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,059
around and from that Central Area so

1527
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:26,460
there's a question with a automobility

1528
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,640
is actually being

1529
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,039
properly uh uh challenged or is this

1530
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:34,319
more of an urban policy that focuses on

1531
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,020
valorization of specific areas of the

1532
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,599
city and here it's you don't have to be

1533
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,660
a smart critical geographer to ask if

1534
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:45,059
this is not part of some revolarization

1535
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:48,660
strategies that try to increase rent and

1536
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,319
profit to gentrify quite simply specific

1537
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,660
areas of the city and the limitation of

1538
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,660
car traffic being part of of that policy

1539
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:00,180
to beautify the area to make it more

1540
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,700
attractive to tourists to specific type

1541
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,220
of investors

1542
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,460
while limiting mobility of of this of

1543
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,380
this kind

1544
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,440
this we've covered and here we arrive to

1545
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,440
the to the well to it to a case of of

1546
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,599
such a policy limiting presence of the

1547
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:21,299
calf the pier tonight in Brussels which

1548
01:07:21,299 --> 01:07:25,200
I'm quite sure uh all of you have uh

1549
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,319
have already experienced and and see

1550
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:31,500
so well this map you've seen quite a lot

1551
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,760
before I'm sure Brussels with its um

1552
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,160
Zone 30 so the the limitation of of

1553
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,280
speed there and the petone marked in in

1554
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,740
red uh at the moment of installation the

1555
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:47,339
biggest pedestrian area in uh in Europe

1556
01:07:47,339 --> 01:07:48,900
I wonder whether you've got any

1557
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,780
impressions of this place before I

1558
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,839
um show you my take on on or share with

1559
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,400
you my take on on what happened over

1560
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,140
there

1561
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,480
um I imagine you've been to lupiteria

1562
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,460
but do you have any

1563
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,740
uh any interesting thoughts about this

1564
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,900
do you like this place do you think it's

1565
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,680
not so great

1566
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,280
um I don't know I don't I don't have a

1567
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,460
very uh deep thought about it I don't

1568
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,500
think but um

1569
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,738
it's definitely nicer than it was uh I

1570
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:25,020
mean like I lived in the center for like

1571
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,179
five years ago or like no was it five

1572
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:29,520
years ago like longer ago but like it

1573
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,620
was really horrible like when you cycled

1574
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,738
through like downtown it was really

1575
01:08:33,738 --> 01:08:37,439
awful because like the road was just

1576
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,198
disgusting like you don't you didn't

1577
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:42,479
really want to be there

1578
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,580
um now I mean it's a bit

1579
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,920
no I I don't have the feeling it's it's

1580
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,359
very much

1581
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:49,198
um

1582
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:52,140
it's it's very true for what it is you

1583
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:54,299
know like for for like

1584
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:55,920
I don't know it doesn't really feel like

1585
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,299
a downturn it feels a little bit

1586
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,219
provincial

1587
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:00,719
um but like at least it's like I'm

1588
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,359
definitely happy with like that it's

1589
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,339
much better than it used to be like

1590
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:06,479
really

1591
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,640
like it it's it's definitely an

1592
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,620
improvement but it feels the Big City

1593
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:14,819
Vibe a bit okay for those of you who who

1594
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:16,859
didn't see it before it was changed into

1595
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:18,899
a bit of scenario I pushed a slice so

1596
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:21,960
you see in the top image uh how this

1597
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,939
street could look like on a Friday

1598
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:26,100
afternoon quite regularly so full of

1599
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,279
cars for four lanes

1600
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,698
um and then well the situation that's of

1601
01:09:32,698 --> 01:09:34,920
course pre-covered uh well I don't know

1602
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,020
I probably right now if you took that

1603
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,600
picture would be quite similar

1604
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,819
um anybody else who has some some

1605
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:43,439
impressions of how how this

1606
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,839
transformation looked like

1607
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,299
somebody who loves this somebody who

1608
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:49,560
hates this

1609
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,819
and for whatever reason

1610
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:57,480
um I agree with him because it was a

1611
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,440
place

1612
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,780
when uh when I passed when I study in

1613
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,280
Brussels where I pass with my

1614
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,360
girlfriends

1615
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,000
I don't want my girlfriend to let alone

1616
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,760
on the other place

1617
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,420
some years ago but one frustration I

1618
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,679
guess from I I followed the dope process

1619
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,080
and what I know was it was very

1620
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,500
difficult for uh Transportation like

1621
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,199
like MVB and steep

1622
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:28,260
um public transport to pass because it's

1623
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,960
the the lane was was cut

1624
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,340
um yeah so

1625
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:34,980
they wait uh wait for over two hours to

1626
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,380
go to another place when set was five

1627
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,380
minutes it was two hours

1628
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,360
so you mean it affected other modes of

1629
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,640
of of trying to not only the car but

1630
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,420
also public transport yeah yeah the

1631
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,340
victim was public transport and I guess

1632
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:53,040
in in in Brussels it's very important to

1633
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,080
when you have a Prestige project like

1634
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,020
that you need to consider all of

1635
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,400
Transport modes and not only pedestrians

1636
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,080
press each project I think also is an

1637
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,580
important uh

1638
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:09,060
also like like an element to add maybe

1639
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,920
is that it's terrible if you go by bike

1640
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,679
it's really not made for bicycles like I

1641
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,780
I tried cycling through it and I mean

1642
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,580
right now it's not so busy and it's all

1643
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,760
right but like on on on days when there

1644
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,920
is I mean there's lots of tour tourists

1645
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,780
of course lots of people use the the

1646
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,060
area so then it's just really not nice

1647
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,420
to cycle there yes I share these

1648
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,679
Impressions I mean these are not only

1649
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,739
Impressions and the fact is that and

1650
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:36,840
this area was redeveloped but without

1651
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,540
any bicycle policy in mind so there is

1652
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:42,060
basically I'm not I'm the last person to

1653
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,500
say that what was there before was great

1654
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,020
but uh you can vaguely see it on the

1655
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,460
right hand side of the top picture that

1656
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,560
there is actually a bicycle lane not a

1657
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,020
great one but there was one now it's

1658
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,840
it's simply not there uh somebody's

1659
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,940
writing something in the chat

1660
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:59,100
why do they take down the larger trees

1661
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,380
neutralization of bulovanos but I find

1662
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,080
the Landscaping quite poor well so there

1663
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,600
was a number of uh things at stake

1664
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,060
um I mean let's cover that first

1665
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,659
um

1666
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,360
it was announced in January 2014 the

1667
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,860
municipal authorities of the city of

1668
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:17,520
Brussels so the uh Mill Brussels 1000

1669
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,440
announced that they want to expand an

1670
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,120
existing pedestrian zone so you already

1671
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,739
had some streets especially it was

1672
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:26,159
complex that were not open for the cars

1673
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:27,900
and the context of that and that's quite

1674
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,640
an important thing is that there was a

1675
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,520
series of protests called under the

1676
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,440
slogan of picnic the streets a movement

1677
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,960
of uh some spontaneous Civil

1678
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,880
Disobedience basically people would

1679
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,860
occupy space that would normally be

1680
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,320
taken by cars you see that in the the

1681
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,199
picture normally a lot of cars so right

1682
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:48,600
in front of books that will be basically

1683
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,580
uh some kind of an action people would

1684
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:53,880
just sit down and enjoy the Sun and and

1685
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,520
manifest that they want uh allegedly the

1686
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,199
space to be for people

1687
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:01,199
taken away from the cars and this space

1688
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:02,640
should be freed from the Cars to make

1689
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,040
the city center for Brussels more

1690
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,060
sustainable more attractive and more

1691
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,320
livable

1692
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,840
the project is launched in June 2015 so

1693
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,820
that's when the street is closed and

1694
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,739
there is an eight month test phase

1695
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:15,719
without any infrastructural change so at

1696
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:17,520
first to go a little bit to the question

1697
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,380
of design there is no design change

1698
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,600
basically industry is closed and there

1699
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,719
is uh as as many people call it a sea of

1700
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,640
asphalt I mean suddenly you can walk on

1701
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,199
this on the street which

1702
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,420
place a little bit of course on people's

1703
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,340
imaginary that suddenly you realize how

1704
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,500
how huge this infrastructure given to

1705
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,719
the car is and and what what could

1706
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,540
happen in place of this infrastructure

1707
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,219
well

1708
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:42,780
and then progressively after this

1709
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,760
eight-month phase we see some kind of

1710
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,400
infrastructural development so an actual

1711
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,800
change of the build environment

1712
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,040
the problem there is is that well there

1713
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,840
was a quality of design that is being

1714
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,000
put into question I'm not a designer or

1715
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,679
landscaper but a lot of people have

1716
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:00,120
criticized the way that this looks like

1717
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,340
the immediate limitation is that right

1718
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:06,060
underground we've got a canal uh towards

1719
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:07,500
the end of division and we also have a

1720
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,080
metro line of pre-metro line which runs

1721
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,000
right under the the surface of the

1722
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,699
street so it's not for example possible

1723
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:17,580
apparently to put uh to put large trees

1724
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,980
over there which uh already starts you

1725
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,300
know making an impact in terms of how

1726
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,980
the space is uh space is done

1727
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,380
um well there were very high aspirations

1728
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,080
when when plutonium was was uh was

1729
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,880
announced it was not only supposed to be

1730
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,920
a classical project or According to some

1731
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,920
scholars in Brussels or even politicians

1732
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,420
it was not a transport project or a

1733
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,219
Mobility project it was an urban project

1734
01:14:41,219 --> 01:14:43,739
an urban renewal project which by

1735
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:46,620
closing this uh Paris like Boulevard

1736
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:51,020
because actually it is in its uh in its

1737
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,280
architecture very much an inspiration of

1738
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,280
Parisian boulevards the closing of it to

1739
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,980
motorized traffic was supposedly a step

1740
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:01,140
towards getting the city center or the

1741
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:05,760
city as such out of decline to put um as

1742
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,699
the mayor of Marissa meal of the of that

1743
01:15:08,699 --> 01:15:10,320
particular municipality said that

1744
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,120
Brussels the Belgian and European

1745
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,280
Capital would finally enjoy a truly

1746
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,620
Dynamic pedestrian attractive and

1747
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,960
friendly inner city like many other

1748
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,920
International Metropolis

1749
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,420
which is located in the northern part of

1750
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:27,120
of the pitonier and that's the famous uh

1751
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,040
square of famous I'm not sure but the

1752
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,679
characteristic one with the Coca-Cola uh

1753
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,520
signed that uh lights up it was compared

1754
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,219
to Times Square so the idea was to make

1755
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:39,840
this project

1756
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,760
um allow Brussels to become an

1757
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,340
international City to to create this

1758
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,020
Prestige project as it was I think very

1759
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,239
rightly said uh that would put brussels

1760
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,980
on the international map it was not just

1761
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,320
a question of you know getting rid of

1762
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,560
some some correlated nuisances

1763
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,360
and of course the amount of the plant

1764
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,679
was announced there were a number of

1765
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,360
critics so there were shopkeepers that

1766
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,100
were upset claiming that they would lose

1767
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,020
customers because people could not drive

1768
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:06,540
into the shop residents a number of

1769
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,480
Citizen organizations what were they the

1770
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,460
the issues that they would mention I

1771
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:13,320
mean the the the problems that they

1772
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,640
would that they would note about the

1773
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,320
project well they very much relate to

1774
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,179
this uneven geography that I that I was

1775
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:20,460
talking about so if you look at the the

1776
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:23,159
the map of the of the pizza in red you

1777
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:24,420
see these

1778
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:27,239
um this at that time Europe's largest

1779
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:28,679
pedestrian Zone I think now it's been

1780
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:32,460
surpassed by Ghent and and other cities

1781
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,140
um Brussels is certainly not the only

1782
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,580
city in Europe or in the world that

1783
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:39,540
engages in in these policies it is of

1784
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:42,480
course the main Central axis is cut but

1785
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,460
you see that you can actually drive

1786
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:47,940
around the the city uh the city center

1787
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:50,820
so you've got this area which is

1788
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,679
pedestrian friendly if we can put it

1789
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:54,540
this way where cars

1790
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,120
um Mobility is extremely limited

1791
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,679
um but in fact you can quite easily

1792
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:00,300
drive into the Pentagon as we call it

1793
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,520
and drive around on top of that what's

1794
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,040
also very clear is that

1795
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,960
um a particularity of Brussels which is

1796
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,239
a very high presence of underground or

1797
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:11,880
multi-story parking lots is largely

1798
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,780
unquestioned so actually

1799
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:18,060
this this day today there is about 19

1800
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,860
000 parking spots within the Pentagon

1801
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,440
within the stroke City Center of

1802
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,960
Brussels the original plan of

1803
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,739
pedestrianizing Boulevard

1804
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:30,420
included the creation of additional 1

1805
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:33,420
600 parking spots so the idea would be

1806
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:36,719
that of course we give this space to The

1807
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,540
Pedestrian and we we allow the space to

1808
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:42,120
be to be somehow reclaimed from the car

1809
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,980
but in fact the cost of this or the

1810
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,300
price of this I don't know how to call

1811
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,760
it is that we actually adds to the car

1812
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,560
infrastructure so we definitely do not

1813
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,380
want to make this less accessible as it

1814
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,020
was called by by The Cars

1815
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,300
and then as one of you mentioned there

1816
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,699
was an immediate conflict with uh with

1817
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:01,140
the public transport operator the most

1818
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,780
important one in Brussels Steven who

1819
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:07,020
basically saw uh day lines pushed out of

1820
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,940
the zone so suddenly the buses that

1821
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,460
would cross that area have to be

1822
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,320
um have to have the have to have these

1823
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,360
stops relocated which means that the

1824
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,920
accessibility for people who rely on

1825
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,420
public transport is

1826
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:22,460
uh is somewhat reduced

1827
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:26,580
right and then well that's some years

1828
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,880
later I think that picture is from 2018

1829
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,860
as far as I remember checking on Google

1830
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,360
well there was a kind of a pushback

1831
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,100
right so the cars that were at first

1832
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,960
definitely not allowed on the pitonier

1833
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,300
now in some circumstances in some

1834
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,400
situations can actually enter so you can

1835
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,380
actually see and it's taken directly

1836
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,840
from Google I didn't have to go to the

1837
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,000
pizza near and wait for a truck to enter

1838
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,760
you actually see uh of course the

1839
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,560
delivery vehicles but also public

1840
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,600
transport you see over there in the back

1841
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,159
of the of the picture I see there's a

1842
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,860
bus making a turn and entering a petunia

1843
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,960
and whenever I'm there with friends who

1844
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,580
are not from Brussels I mean they are

1845
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,860
they are really surprised to be on The

1846
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,659
Pedestrian area with public transport

1847
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,820
buses and trucks and taxi drivers and

1848
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,860
other vehicles who in exceptional

1849
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:13,380
circumstances actually can enter which

1850
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,840
questions a little bit this I mean is

1851
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,580
this a pedestrian area or is this a

1852
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:20,760
pedestrian area but without uh really

1853
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,380
getting rid of all the cars just some

1854
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,719
cars

1855
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,719
um the question of yeah

1856
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:29,880
um making this a Prestige project and

1857
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,040
putting Brussels on the map I mean there

1858
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,380
is an argument there to be made and uh

1859
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,840
and some local critical geographers have

1860
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,420
made it myself included that this in

1861
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,920
fact indeed is not a transport project

1862
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,659
in the mobility project it's clearly a

1863
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:45,780
project of rivalry valorizing this

1864
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,820
particular part of the city it's quite

1865
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:52,040
clear that as you go down southwards

1866
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,000
towards the South Station

1867
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,560
those of you who have uh who have been

1868
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,420
there I'm sure I'm sure noticed it those

1869
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,940
of you who haven't that's where we would

1870
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,340
go on the Excursion that I hope we will

1871
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,460
do in Spring you see that this is one of

1872
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,719
the poorest neighborhoods in Brussels

1873
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:12,120
one with very high youth unemployment

1874
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,699
especially where there is a very

1875
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:15,500
um

1876
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,600
precarious tightly knit but very

1877
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,659
vulnerable local economy and any kind of

1878
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:24,780
change in in built environment puts this

1879
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,960
economy on the on the huge pressure

1880
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,179
especially when the narrative around

1881
01:20:29,179 --> 01:20:32,699
clearly uh includes this idea of

1882
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:36,480
bringing big Brands tourism uh to The

1883
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,100
Pedestrian area making this place of

1884
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,340
festivities of consumption of continuous

1885
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,500
Festival

1886
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,840
um

1887
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,520
so for example the alderman for comments

1888
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,260
of the city of Brussels famously said

1889
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,300
that the objective here is not to change

1890
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,540
Mobility the objective is to recreate a

1891
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,699
commercial Promenade new brands which

1892
01:20:56,699 --> 01:20:58,080
are not yet present in Brussels are

1893
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,840
coming there is a real craze and you can

1894
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:01,860
feel it

1895
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:06,179
for the current Brussels 1000 mayor not

1896
01:21:06,179 --> 01:21:08,100
the one that had stepped down because of

1897
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,500
some corruption Scandal

1898
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,320
um the aim of the project is to keep or

1899
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,060
bring the middle class to Brussels to

1900
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:18,600
increase its tax base so suddenly the

1901
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,820
idea is not just to or not at all to

1902
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,580
actually get rid of the cars or or allow

1903
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,500
pedestrians to enjoy the some kind of

1904
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,420
newly created area it's a very Urban

1905
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,120
project in a very kind of Twisted way so

1906
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,880
the idea really is to create a new space

1907
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,800
a new neighborhood perhaps of

1908
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,920
consumption of leisure of 24 7 shopping

1909
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,460
which also of course uses or engages

1910
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:46,020
with the narrative for sustainability

1911
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,360
and livability and is somewhat related

1912
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,699
to mobility and transport but to a

1913
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:53,719
limited extent

1914
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,640
you see that there is almost only white

1915
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,100
people there like so the the people that

1916
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,420
you talked about that you see on the

1917
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,520
lower slide

1918
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,100
um like like the owners of the PC market

1919
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,980
on the owners of like 0.50 like

1920
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:16,260
basically all all people with the color

1921
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,420
they they don't they don't feature in

1922
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,520
the marketing of the of the city about

1923
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,920
the project it's a very good point of

1924
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,659
course that's a that's a very common

1925
01:22:24,659 --> 01:22:26,340
issue with these visualizations and

1926
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:29,340
imagining of uh future everyone's Super

1927
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,239
Why

1928
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,380
um but like there's there I saw that

1929
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,420
there's one black man on the right

1930
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,760
but there's also no

1931
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,679
um yeah I know people with disabilities

1932
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:42,239
very few old people yeah so yes I mean

1933
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:45,360
it's a it's not a very diverse image

1934
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,460
it's a good point and also in no way

1935
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:49,260
does it correspond to the actual reality

1936
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,060
of of that neighborhood and the kind of

1937
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:55,920
services absolutely no I mean yeah

1938
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,260
um Well we I'm really need to speed it

1939
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:01,199
up so um so we cover some important uh

1940
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,300
stuff okay until we finish no no but

1941
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,580
thank you it's a good comment there is

1942
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,960
of course all issues related to

1943
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,320
participation and and no actual change

1944
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,659
of power in in the patronier but I think

1945
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:14,699
the petone is a very good example of of

1946
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:17,219
how these sustainable ideas can be

1947
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:19,080
applied without changing at all

1948
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,940
questions of who actually decides and

1949
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:23,520
for whom uh transport policies are being

1950
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,659
made

1951
01:23:24,659 --> 01:23:27,719
so very often a sustainable discourse

1952
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:30,000
focuses when it imagines participation

1953
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,300
of users of the of the beneficence of

1954
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,699
the of the projects uh it basically

1955
01:23:35,699 --> 01:23:38,280
imagines that the the main idea is there

1956
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,260
to build consensus to inform people of

1957
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,600
the decisions that are rational that are

1958
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,120
are good practices best practices in

1959
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,739
terms of achieving sustainable Mobility

1960
01:23:46,739 --> 01:23:49,260
protecting the environment and whatnot

1961
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:52,800
so as a Flemish actually scholar has

1962
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,800
once wrote in in 2000 about the problems

1963
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,540
of sustainable transport policies that's

1964
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:00,120
the last bullet point these policies

1965
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,980
include a harmonious and conflict

1966
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,260
developing vocabulary that ignores and

1967
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:06,000
silences the deeply contested ways

1968
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,800
through which the transport system is

1969
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,960
continuously shaped and transformed and

1970
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,699
which inevitably results in a variety of

1971
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:15,080
winning and losing interest groups

1972
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:17,520
that's I think the case in many other

1973
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,679
sustainable transport projects this idea

1974
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,080
of winners and loses is swept under the

1975
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,060
carpet so in in theory everybody

1976
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,580
everybody gains but those who are

1977
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:28,920
clearly upset are not heard are not

1978
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,960
really listened to and often are mocked

1979
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,239
so again we go back to this moral

1980
01:24:33,239 --> 01:24:34,980
geography of bad behavior and good

1981
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:37,440
behavior of City shopkeepers who don't

1982
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,820
understand that this is a project that

1983
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:41,040
they will benefit from but car drivers

1984
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,679
they want to access the City versus good

1985
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,679
consuming middle class pedestrians or or

1986
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:48,540
cyclists not so more not so much in the

1987
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,520
case of application but scientists are

1988
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,580
also part of the part of the vision

1989
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:54,840
um

1990
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,659
and in all this to make this point quite

1991
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:01,199
short there is much more impact no not

1992
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,480
impact much more Focus much more

1993
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,580
emphasis on

1994
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:08,159
um the success of these practices rather

1995
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:11,460
than on the interaction with complex

1996
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:14,760
social spatial phenomena that are there

1997
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,739
in the city so there is much more focus

1998
01:25:16,739 --> 01:25:18,659
on on the transport part of Transport

1999
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:20,760
project rather than or the urban part of

2000
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,380
the purchase well we don't have a lot of

2001
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,540
time to deal with okay what could be

2002
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:27,020
done with with this hegemony of

2003
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:29,520
neoclassical on the one hand that's last

2004
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,219
week and sustainable on the other

2005
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:33,900
um that's today perspectives on

2006
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,360
transport but let's try

2007
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,820
um so what would diverse critical

2008
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,219
approaches to to transport and Mobility

2009
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,620
be on the one hand

2010
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:45,719
the new mobilities paradigm so that's

2011
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:47,940
another reading for today if you manage

2012
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,520
to read it uh that's great if not I

2013
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,440
encourage you to to have a look because

2014
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,320
that's an absolutely fundamental reading

2015
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,600
for Mobility Scholars these days I mean

2016
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,880
maybe sheller and John Aria are two very

2017
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,219
important figures in in in this field of

2018
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:05,219
geography or or any kind of discipline

2019
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:06,840
that deals with mobility and transport

2020
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,400
so here

2021
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,500
we've got a bit of a shift of attention

2022
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,239
shift of focus and

2023
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:15,600
it's really putting um it's shifting

2024
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,520
away from transport as a as an

2025
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,840
infrastructural phenomenon for example

2026
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,239
to a Mobility as a social and political

2027
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:24,000
phenomenon that's expected Builds on on

2028
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,880
diverse disciplines from sociology and

2029
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,560
political studies to ethnography and

2030
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,940
anthropology

2031
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,739
and it really explores a lot of issues

2032
01:26:31,739 --> 01:26:33,300
that cultural studies Scholars for

2033
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,400
example would deal with looking at in a

2034
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,900
number of phenomena happening in cities

2035
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,400
so different representations and

2036
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,460
meanings of Mobility Sensations

2037
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:43,440
experiencing experiences of Mobility so

2038
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,580
everything that happens on this micro

2039
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:46,860
level of what people what kind of

2040
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:49,260
practices and Norms are being being

2041
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,440
observable or being practiced in

2042
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,760
Mobility related spaces in public

2043
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,320
transport for example in these

2044
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,960
pedestrian areas and what cultural codes

2045
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,320
and Norms are related to automobility

2046
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,780
uh the problem with this particular

2047
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:07,020
approach is that well it looks very much

2048
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,120
at the micro level and whenever it

2049
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,980
engages with structural issues around

2050
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:13,739
Mobility it runs the risk of being quite

2051
01:27:13,739 --> 01:27:15,239
descriptive so it mentions a number of

2052
01:27:15,239 --> 01:27:18,120
issues race class inequality but there

2053
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,920
is not so much of a methodological depth

2054
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,020
in terms of exploring these issues and

2055
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:23,940
also it's a concept that is quite

2056
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,800
Western in a sense that it developed in

2057
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,420
the global North and then rather

2058
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:30,120
specific areas of it and it only now

2059
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,000
starts engaging with with situations

2060
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,820
with empirical context in the global

2061
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:38,040
stuff

2062
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:42,420
another approach another Avenue for for

2063
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,760
for doing critical research about

2064
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,940
transformability is building on the

2065
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,920
traditions of urban political economy of

2066
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,420
Transport right so looking at the city

2067
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,760
as a social and political construct

2068
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,000
which by no means by in no way

2069
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,179
is governed by some rational laws of

2070
01:28:00,179 --> 01:28:01,620
supply and demand like in the

2071
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:04,260
neoclassical Paradigm or which does not

2072
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:07,920
really look at people as consumers that

2073
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,800
have to be convinced to to drop or to

2074
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,719
disengage from

2075
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,420
um unwelcome or bad type of behavior and

2076
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,159
start engaging in good type of behavior

2077
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:20,400
and but rather looking at people at as

2078
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,500
at Urban inhabitants as political agents

2079
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,540
who do not make just rational decisions

2080
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,400
in terms of how they move but have

2081
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,159
political potential to to shape the the

2082
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:32,040
urban reality to change how transport

2083
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,840
and Mobility is organized in the in the

2084
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,480
locality in this city and when you look

2085
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,760
at critical urban geography and a lot of

2086
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,560
names that I'm sure you've already heard

2087
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,480
or maybe even read

2088
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,219
um from before

2089
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:46,679
David Harvey Neil Smith Edward Soldier

2090
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:50,420
they've all contributed to to

2091
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,440
conceptualizing to exploring this Lane

2092
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,139
between infrastructural development and

2093
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:56,760
social spatial distribution of public

2094
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,300
services so transport has has been there

2095
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,000
to to um

2096
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,380
to analyze the critical development of

2097
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,420
the city but

2098
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:09,780
absolutely foundational uh readings

2099
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,880
there or the first steps towards

2100
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,860
critically exploring the relationship

2101
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,840
between the transport and the City come

2102
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,520
from feminist geographers who would

2103
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,260
arrive and that's the reading that you

2104
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,159
also

2105
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:23,520
um I think was a sign for today uh Susan

2106
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,000
Hansen's work on the deconstructing this

2107
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,980
apparent divide between the home and

2108
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:30,920
work and

2109
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:35,340
attaching and women with domestic uh

2110
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,780
situations and apparently

2111
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:41,580
imagining them as less mobile Less

2112
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:44,580
Mobile beings while uh attaching this

2113
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:46,260
this Mobility potential to to

2114
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:50,159
predominantly male male subjects and

2115
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,139
male situations

2116
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:54,500
foreign

2117
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,860
part of that is to understand

2118
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:01,260
the homework relationship and homework

2119
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,659
commute which I mentioned last week is

2120
01:30:03,659 --> 01:30:06,239
is absolutely the most uh well let's see

2121
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:07,739
the foundational focus of Transport

2122
01:30:07,739 --> 01:30:10,139
geographers analyzing

2123
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:11,760
um these Mobility patterns related to

2124
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,520
the to the move from work to home and

2125
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,440
the feminist geographers already in

2126
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,280
1980s demonstrated that this uh this way

2127
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,840
of looking at transport and also this

2128
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,900
way of engaging Mobility is fundamental

2129
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,360
for maintaining uh for maintaining

2130
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,980
capitalism this is something that is the

2131
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:30,840
Cornerstone of the of the capitalist

2132
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,320
system in cities or outside of them

2133
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,139
what emerges from this is understanding

2134
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:39,840
transport and Mobility is not just uh an

2135
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,580
infrastructural phenomenon or something

2136
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,500
that has some environmental

2137
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,360
repercussions and some social ones and

2138
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,620
here I'm thinking about sustainable

2139
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:48,840
approaches to Mobility but as

2140
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,900
essentially a form of capital Mobility

2141
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:56,460
is a as a potential that is unevenly

2142
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,380
distributed as any form of capital

2143
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,440
around or across Society across its

2144
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,960
different spaces and across its its

2145
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,780
classes which leads to understanding and

2146
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,760
challenging different structures social

2147
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,060
political economic that stand behind

2148
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,400
what makes transport unsustainable in

2149
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,320
the first place so it's really asking a

2150
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,840
question why are people moving in

2151
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,460
particular ways not because they are

2152
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,320
used to a particular lifestyle because

2153
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,060
they have some cultural norms but

2154
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,739
understanding a political and economic

2155
01:31:25,739 --> 01:31:28,260
system that enables for instance the

2156
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,300
domination of the car and trying to

2157
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:32,280
address the system as a result rather

2158
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:34,260
than looking at how people can become

2159
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:37,199
convinced and or how situation in terms

2160
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:38,820
of Mobility can be changed in specific

2161
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:41,040
areas of the city it's looking at things

2162
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,960
Much More Much More broadly in much more

2163
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,540
structural ways

2164
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,699
right so

2165
01:31:47,699 --> 01:31:50,699
and here I attached bibliography to the

2166
01:31:50,699 --> 01:31:52,679
end of this to this slide so you can

2167
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:54,120
look at these different studies if you

2168
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,679
if you're interested in transported

2169
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:59,219
Mobility there is a line of of research

2170
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:00,540
that is looked at the transported

2171
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:04,159
Mobility as a way of reproducing

2172
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:07,020
existing social political economic

2173
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:09,840
interests regulatory Frameworks power

2174
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,179
relations regulated by the market on the

2175
01:32:12,179 --> 01:32:13,980
one hand and by the state and very often

2176
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:17,400
contested by from the bottom up

2177
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:18,960
there is

2178
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,239
a lot of research for some reason the

2179
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:22,679
reason the references are not showing up

2180
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:24,120
but if you're interested I'm more than

2181
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,100
happy to send you those that something

2182
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,139
strange with my slide here but there is

2183
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:30,840
an ongoing work uh already going back to

2184
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,960
the 1990s that shows how neoliberal

2185
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,600
policies that affect Urban culture

2186
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,239
provision of housing Urban environment

2187
01:32:39,239 --> 01:32:41,100
are also extremely present in provision

2188
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,280
of transport and Mobility how in in a

2189
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,199
natural transport is increasingly

2190
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:48,060
commodified and for example congestion

2191
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,219
charging that I mentioned today is part

2192
01:32:50,219 --> 01:32:53,219
of that it's turning and we could think

2193
01:32:53,219 --> 01:32:55,679
public space that's an urban Motorway or

2194
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,260
an urban street is into a commodity that

2195
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,480
has an additional price tag attached to

2196
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,179
it which as we consume we have to

2197
01:33:03,179 --> 01:33:05,580
additionally pay for depending as I

2198
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,100
mentioned not on our means but basically

2199
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:11,900
on our on our demand

2200
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,400
there is also a fundamental issue that

2201
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,280
many geographers have dealt with that is

2202
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,739
of Transport related inequality and

2203
01:33:19,739 --> 01:33:21,120
exclusion so basically trying to

2204
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,719
understand to what extent transport

2205
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,780
um enables movement of of some people

2206
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:30,659
while restricting that of that of others

2207
01:33:30,659 --> 01:33:34,679
this we will Skip and of course uh well

2208
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:37,440
it might seem very obvious today but if

2209
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,300
you look at what was being done in in

2210
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:41,040
geography in urban geography or

2211
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,840
transport geography in the 80s and the

2212
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,219
90s that was definitely not the case

2213
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:47,159
there is now a rise of research which

2214
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:49,679
looks at the questions of class and the

2215
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,659
questions of race and the question of

2216
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:53,880
gender is absolutely fundamental for

2217
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:56,159
understanding uh Transport Systems in

2218
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,980
cities and and Beyond them and one of

2219
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,600
them is this

2220
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,000
um well maybe not such a foundational

2221
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,400
reading but still something that is is

2222
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,380
very important and and and really

2223
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,900
defined the agenda of of research into

2224
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:13,500
transport for at least this decade uh of

2225
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,179
course there's there's more recent stuff

2226
01:34:15,179 --> 01:34:16,560
that also has been written but I think

2227
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:19,020
this is quite a nice uh introduction to

2228
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,719
the question of gender and Mobility

2229
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:22,860
um

2230
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:26,880
and here we see that as with the

2231
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,199
questions of race and the question with

2232
01:34:28,199 --> 01:34:30,179
class but this is something that uh was

2233
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:31,260
already quite established in the field

2234
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:34,440
already uh there is an Inseparable

2235
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,300
relationship between gender and and

2236
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:39,300
Mobility that on the one hand translated

2237
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:42,659
mobility mean development or some kind

2238
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:44,340
of opening of accessibility to different

2239
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:46,860
opportunities breaking this supposed

2240
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:50,580
Paradigm of uh the domestic female and

2241
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,500
the work-related male but actually

2242
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,320
Mobility is something that opens uh

2243
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,840
opens this time and that gender on the

2244
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,940
other hand affects travel reasons and

2245
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,980
patents in terms of the complexity in

2246
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,199
terms of the frequency and regularity

2247
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,420
and in terms of why actually people

2248
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:08,639
engage in in movement why do they

2249
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:11,340
actually move around the city

2250
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:13,739
and perhaps one critique that could be

2251
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:15,179
made about the paper that I ask you to

2252
01:35:15,179 --> 01:35:17,040
to read for today is that well it

2253
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,260
approaches women as a rather unified

2254
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:22,679
category that can be uh uh maybe not

2255
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:26,040
reduced but summarized into in in terms

2256
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:29,159
of particular Mobility patterns that uh

2257
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:31,199
half of humanity engages I think that's

2258
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:33,900
a little bit uh risky always but what

2259
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:35,040
clearly

2260
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,139
um I think is interesting in this kind

2261
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:39,540
of line of work as I said uh there is

2262
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:41,400
there is a definite follow-up and and

2263
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,260
work that explore these questions in

2264
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,060
much more detail and and it's much more

2265
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,880
fine tune to a sophisticated but we see

2266
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,500
that

2267
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,940
um without considering the agenda

2268
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:52,679
component we we basically miss the fact

2269
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:56,040
that uh in many urban contexts women

2270
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,960
engage in a completely different way

2271
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,420
with Mobility they conduct trips which

2272
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:03,480
are much more complex regular because

2273
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:05,940
they quite simply are related to uh

2274
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:08,100
diverse care related activities they

2275
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:10,620
would be much more inclined or perhaps

2276
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,780
forced to

2277
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:16,320
um to bring other people along to uh to

2278
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,260
act as drivers for other passengers and

2279
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,540
because they engage in quite simply more

2280
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:24,780
activity these than than male

2281
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:27,840
subjects in this way I'm simplifying

2282
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,239
here of course a whole lot but this way

2283
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:31,679
of approaching transport and Mobility

2284
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,800
uncovers and not only differences in

2285
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,239
terms of how people move but differences

2286
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:38,460
in terms of power relations that are

2287
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,260
there behind movement and transport

2288
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:44,340
which in my humble opinion is maybe a

2289
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:45,480
little bit there in sustainable

2290
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,639
approaches to Mobility but it's quite

2291
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:49,679
simply not pronounced enough or does not

2292
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,300
really show us

2293
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:55,500
um in full depth the the multi-level

2294
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,420
structure of power relations that are

2295
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,219
there behind behind transported and

2296
01:36:59,219 --> 01:37:01,520
Mobility

2297
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:06,120
um now what's left I'm we are we are

2298
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,219
running out of time so so I I don't

2299
01:37:08,219 --> 01:37:09,420
definitely don't want to talk about

2300
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:10,679
everything but

2301
01:37:10,679 --> 01:37:12,480
what's also important to remember is

2302
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,420
that well besides questions of Transport

2303
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:17,940
workers because so far we've we've

2304
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:20,159
basically talked mostly if not only

2305
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:22,380
about passengers transport users people

2306
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:24,420
who use transport

2307
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,400
um there's a question of Transport labor

2308
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:29,219
but also very importantly a lot of

2309
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:31,080
research done on on transport and

2310
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,060
Mobility as a vehicle for for some

2311
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:36,420
contestation discontent and struggle and

2312
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:39,060
I started these two sessions with uh

2313
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,980
with Greta tunberg with protists in

2314
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:44,040
Chile and other places and

2315
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:46,500
year in year out sometimes sometimes

2316
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,239
month and month out you see that

2317
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:51,179
transport is used as a very important uh

2318
01:37:51,179 --> 01:37:53,940
subject for a lot of for very diverse

2319
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,820
movements and social groups to expressly

2320
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:59,699
discontent with whatever it is and

2321
01:37:59,699 --> 01:38:02,280
sometimes quite directly in capitalist

2322
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:04,260
system and that's the case with G Le

2323
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:07,560
Jean and who quite symbolically would

2324
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:10,679
occupy roundabouts across rural or

2325
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:14,179
Suburban France and sometimes

2326
01:38:14,179 --> 01:38:16,139
symbolically and that's in East

2327
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:18,239
Jerusalem a Palestinian activists

2328
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,300
attacking

2329
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:22,980
light rails and kind of Tramway stations

2330
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,199
as a symbol of Israeli colonization in

2331
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,239
East Jerusalem

2332
01:38:27,239 --> 01:38:28,560
um sometimes these will be protest

2333
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,139
against uh some kind of a surface level

2334
01:38:31,139 --> 01:38:33,420
policy like the increase of public

2335
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:35,639
transport fares or policing and that's

2336
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:37,860
the case in New York City or the

2337
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:39,540
construction of of one of these

2338
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:41,699
underground parkings related to Le

2339
01:38:41,699 --> 01:38:43,620
pitonier that would add to the number of

2340
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:46,080
parking spots in the city while

2341
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,960
supposedly actually opening the city for

2342
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,239
the for the people

2343
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:54,840
this we will have to skip

2344
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,460
um the very last point that I want to

2345
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:58,080
make today I mean I I still would like

2346
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,480
to give us maybe 10 minutes for your

2347
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,420
questions and maybe some comments uh if

2348
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:06,360
you still have energy to to do that is

2349
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,520
that and that's perhaps related a little

2350
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,540
bit to this question of new

2351
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:11,280
liberalization of transforms and

2352
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,400
Mobility is that what we see uh is that

2353
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,620
despite these different

2354
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:18,780
um theoretical approaches and critical

2355
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:21,600
questions that people critical

2356
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,139
geographers are asking we see

2357
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:27,840
um a process of standardization of

2358
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,940
Transport policies so if you are a

2359
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,260
transport engineer and transport

2360
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:33,420
Economist today there is really this

2361
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,239
tendency towards

2362
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:37,980
unifying experiences of different cities

2363
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:40,620
into a portfolio of best practices which

2364
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:43,080
are then transferable from from one

2365
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,639
locality to another there's a huge

2366
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:47,580
business behind it and not only in terms

2367
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:50,400
of think tanks uh and big consultancy

2368
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,920
firms but a whole flurry of events which

2369
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,719
you can learn from

2370
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,580
experiences of others which you can

2371
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,560
learn about what your city should be

2372
01:39:58,560 --> 01:39:59,400
doing

2373
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,800
and

2374
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,940
some Scholars have engaged with that

2375
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:05,100
studying specifically the policy

2376
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:07,380
mobility of of these best practices and

2377
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:10,560
recipes in the field of urban transport

2378
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,020
but what's perhaps quite important to be

2379
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,900
to be added to this is that well

2380
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,600
the story of of policy transfer is is

2381
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:20,639
quite long I mean the the tradition of

2382
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,380
deploying Western World Views

2383
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:24,719
eurocentric Concepts and theories and

2384
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:27,780
methods in a more or less unchanged way

2385
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:30,239
in in some other geographical contexts

2386
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:33,120
in Africa Asia Latin America

2387
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,100
it's a very long story and the story is

2388
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,739
has a name in its colonization or

2389
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:39,000
coloniality

2390
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
and this is something that really is

2391
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,860
there to be done by by the future

2392
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:46,020
generation of of

2393
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:48,239
critical geographers or the transport

2394
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:49,980
geographers or Urban geographers is that

2395
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,380
of decolonizing this body of knowledge

2396
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,520
which

2397
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,920
um pretty much everything that I have

2398
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,440
referred to uh in in these two sessions

2399
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,239
comes very much

2400
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,860
um from the global North that reflects

2401
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:04,320
my own education that's something that I

2402
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:07,679
think I still have to do myself is to

2403
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,080
really start looking at the transport

2404
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,960
reality and start defining

2405
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,820
um formulating questions about this

2406
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:17,159
reality in terms of Transit Mobility not

2407
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:19,020
from our Global Northern perspective but

2408
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:21,719
also that of the South and just

2409
01:41:21,719 --> 01:41:24,540
uh again it's a it's a just a simple

2410
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,580
example of what this could mean in

2411
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,620
practice

2412
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:30,380
is looking at the question of

2413
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:32,460
informality in transport which

2414
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:34,500
traditionally uh that's a slide from one

2415
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:38,159
of these classic reports uh Commissioned

2416
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,260
I think either by un or the World Bank

2417
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:43,440
on informal transport looks at

2418
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,179
informality in transport as something

2419
01:41:45,179 --> 01:41:47,580
that means bad quality in terms of

2420
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,860
safety of passengers speeding

2421
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:52,920
environmental impact basically some old

2422
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:57,060
rickety Vehicles which uh await to be

2423
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:00,320
transformed into modern Western formal

2424
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:03,780
public transport system the the kind of

2425
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,820
we know from northern cities like

2426
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,980
Brussels or or many others in Belgium

2427
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:11,219
France or Germany or whatnot

2428
01:42:11,219 --> 01:42:13,560
um but and that's something that has

2429
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,780
been done quite recently or is in

2430
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:17,100
process

2431
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,400
um is actually understanding our

2432
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,960
experience of transport and mobility in

2433
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,880
our formal environment is very much

2434
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:26,100
something that can be informed by these

2435
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:28,739
informal experiences of the Google South

2436
01:42:28,739 --> 01:42:32,460
an example well if you ever are at wbd

2437
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:34,080
these days unfortunately this practice

2438
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,739
is on hold because of you know what

2439
01:42:36,739 --> 01:42:40,560
there is a flowery maybe not but at

2440
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,719
least a few informal transport practices

2441
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,179
that you can find in the gardeni area

2442
01:42:45,179 --> 01:42:48,239
these informal taxis vans that bring

2443
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,840
passengers informally somewhat illegally

2444
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:54,420
from the South Station to um

2445
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:56,219
Charlevoix airport so the Brussels South

2446
01:42:56,219 --> 01:42:58,980
Charlevoix airport and to Paris which ex

2447
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:02,219
well exhibit a very strong similarity

2448
01:43:02,219 --> 01:43:03,060
with

2449
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,980
many other informal practices that you

2450
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:07,440
can find in cities across South Asia

2451
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,480
Africa and Latin America

2452
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,760
and then finally while these practices

2453
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,860
of course attract whenever they do they

2454
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:15,420
attract very negative attention of the

2455
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,159
media of the police they are treated as

2456
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:19,500
something that is a illegal and be

2457
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:22,440
unfair to formal Regulators that pay

2458
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:25,199
taxes and have to operate within the

2459
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:28,080
legal framework of in this case the

2460
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,760
Brussels capital region

2461
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,100
there is and here we go back to the

2462
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:34,260
beginning of the of the of the first

2463
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:37,139
session a number of practices which are

2464
01:43:37,139 --> 01:43:38,760
proposed by the transport industry

2465
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,980
transport of Mobility industry like Uber

2466
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:43,380
or many other app-based practices which

2467
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:45,840
are essentially informal practices which

2468
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,900
try to operate in the in statuses of the

2469
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:52,020
system and somewhat legal but also not

2470
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:54,239
not to the full extent if you think for

2471
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,460
example about what Uber does to its

2472
01:43:56,460 --> 01:44:00,420
workers or what is the spatial impact if

2473
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:02,760
we can put the sway of these e-scooters

2474
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:05,639
which uh operate in public space but

2475
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:07,800
very often literally occupy the space

2476
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:10,440
the paving and and whatnot without

2477
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:13,800
necessarily making the system officially

2478
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:17,580
legal or recognized

2479
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:21,179
well here we pause our little right of

2480
01:44:21,179 --> 01:44:23,639
two sessions uh I apologize for this bit

2481
01:44:23,639 --> 01:44:25,800
of a fast-paced ending to the second

2482
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:27,960
session but we just uh I realized that

2483
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,820
we we ran out of time to discuss things

2484
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:33,179
a little bit more detailed way but we

2485
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:34,380
still have eight minutes for some

2486
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:37,080
questions if you have them uh maybe some

2487
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,060
points that you you have in your in your

2488
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:40,440
in your head right now something that

2489
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:44,659
you want to share this is the moment

2490
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:49,219
and maybe I'll stop sharing my slides

2491
01:44:56,400 --> 01:45:00,560
do you have some questions some comments

2492
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:15,199
well

2493
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:17,400
it's perfectly fine if you don't of

2494
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,980
course I mean it's quite late in the day

2495
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:21,540
I understand it

2496
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,239
and it's it's definitely a sub-optimal

2497
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:26,040
experience to do that through through

2498
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:27,119
Zoom world

2499
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:30,500
any of these platforms

2500
01:45:34,139 --> 01:45:37,739
all right Vitali is

2501
01:45:37,739 --> 01:45:40,020
asking about transport labor and there's

2502
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:41,880
also one more technical question

2503
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:44,159
well quite simply the concept of

2504
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:46,679
Transport labor looks at Labor Relations

2505
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:50,340
and conditions in transport so it's

2506
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:52,320
trying to

2507
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:53,219
um

2508
01:45:53,219 --> 01:45:55,199
change the emphasis a little bit I mean

2509
01:45:55,199 --> 01:45:56,639
if you look at the literature on the

2510
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:59,100
neoclassical or sustainable side

2511
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:03,320
and the predominant focus of

2512
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:06,840
I would really say 99 of the studies is

2513
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,780
on the passenger on the on the driver or

2514
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:13,679
the or the consumer and the question of

2515
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:16,380
what working conditions shift to

2516
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:17,940
sustainable transport involves for

2517
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:20,159
example it's very rarely asked

2518
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:23,639
and that I think can lead us into some

2519
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:25,760
dead end

2520
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,380
situations in which for example we we

2521
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:31,500
really gave a lot of Hope and we built a

2522
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,639
lot of expectations towards some

2523
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:34,920
Mobility practices like uber like the

2524
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,800
electric scooters or whatnot without

2525
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,800
really understanding that um and that

2526
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,480
comes from transport labor literature

2527
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,639
that the main Innovation that Ubi brings

2528
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,860
to the table perhaps is not uh

2529
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:49,500
connecting drivers and users because

2530
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,659
that existed before and I mean informal

2531
01:46:51,659 --> 01:46:54,780
transport without the app of course but

2532
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:58,619
it exists in most uh cities in the world

2533
01:46:58,619 --> 01:47:00,600
in a global some Global Northern cities

2534
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,280
being an exception rather than the rule

2535
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:06,179
but the actual Innovation is degrading

2536
01:47:06,179 --> 01:47:09,239
transport degrading working relations to

2537
01:47:09,239 --> 01:47:12,179
uh end of the 19th century basically a

2538
01:47:12,179 --> 01:47:14,280
worker has very few rights so it does

2539
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:15,659
not have the right to unionize to

2540
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:17,699
collectively bargain and it's not even

2541
01:47:17,699 --> 01:47:19,860
recognized as a worker it's basically

2542
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:23,659
some kind of free atom contractor

2543
01:47:23,659 --> 01:47:25,639
who

2544
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:28,679
in spare Leisure Time engages in driving

2545
01:47:28,679 --> 01:47:31,320
people around the city which we all know

2546
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,560
from now a whole body of work on Uber is

2547
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,119
definitely not the case I mean these

2548
01:47:36,119 --> 01:47:38,639
people are full-time workers not just

2549
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:41,040
hobbyists who try to make some spare

2550
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,920
money on the on the side

2551
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,619
um so yes

2552
01:47:46,619 --> 01:47:49,139
that's what transport labor is about

2553
01:47:49,139 --> 01:47:50,880
some technical questions let's address

2554
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,980
those for the next discussion seminar is

2555
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:54,480
it the same way of working with

2556
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:58,320
PowerPoint and voice over

2557
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,420
um well the way I understand you did it

2558
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:02,280
in other discussion seminars is that you

2559
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:04,320
basically recorded your presentation

2560
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:07,320
which then either you sent to me I think

2561
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:09,119
that's probably a better

2562
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:12,060
solution and we basically listen to and

2563
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,000
then we have a discussion which you

2564
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,380
facilitate right as those who discuss

2565
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:17,480
the paper

2566
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:20,400
uh so it's not exactly voice over I mean

2567
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,320
so you don't present the PowerPoint live

2568
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,020
the idea is that you pre-recorded the

2569
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,719
presentation with your fellow uh

2570
01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:29,880
students

2571
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:32,219
and will the exam be online as well yes

2572
01:48:32,219 --> 01:48:34,739
the exam will be online and we are

2573
01:48:34,739 --> 01:48:36,960
meeting with basnick and David to

2574
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,639
discuss exactly how this will be done

2575
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,920
most likely we'll be in well obviously

2576
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:44,400
since we will not be in your rooms it

2577
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,139
will be an open book exam

2578
01:48:46,139 --> 01:48:47,820
so you will have access to the slides

2579
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:50,400
and all that so but since we haven't

2580
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,500
done that before it would be a classic

2581
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,420
exam we are we are discussing how to do

2582
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:56,880
this so that it's challenging enough for

2583
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:01,080
you and also not too difficult

2584
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:01,679
um

2585
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:04,139
right so with the voice voice over

2586
01:49:04,139 --> 01:49:05,400
indeed

2587
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:06,780
the Belgian Brussels government ever

2588
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:08,159
taken any action to prevent informal

2589
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:10,320
Transportation do you know how relaxed

2590
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,760
they are towards this well actually I

2591
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,060
researched these navit as they called

2592
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:17,460
they'll go from midi to the Charlevoix

2593
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,659
airport and

2594
01:49:18,659 --> 01:49:21,119
no the Russell's government is

2595
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:23,040
definitely not happy about these these

2596
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:26,239
uh informal taxis the situation there is

2597
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:30,659
that these men and all of them are a

2598
01:49:30,659 --> 01:49:31,800
male

2599
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:34,080
um uh official taxi drivers so they have

2600
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,600
a taxi license but what they basically

2601
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,600
do is that to make more money they offer

2602
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,239
individual seats in in the events and

2603
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:44,520
the taxis and that's precisely what's

2604
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,440
illegal so you cannot as a taxi driver

2605
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:49,040
in Brussels you cannot uh

2606
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:51,380
basically stand there on the street and

2607
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:54,360
try to approach potential passengers

2608
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:56,219
offering them individual places in the

2609
01:49:56,219 --> 01:49:58,440
car it has to be the whole car that is

2610
01:49:58,440 --> 01:49:59,340
rented

2611
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:03,119
well it's a bit ironic but uh what

2612
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,639
happened a few years after this practice

2613
01:50:05,639 --> 01:50:08,760
uh got into the focus of I don't want to

2614
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:10,080
say public debate but basically these

2615
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:11,580
drivers started being harassed by police

2616
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:13,080
and there was a legal procedure against

2617
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:16,619
them uh flipko I don't know if that name

2618
01:50:16,619 --> 01:50:18,840
rings a bell it's a company that runs

2619
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:21,300
the official pass from midi to Charlotte

2620
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:25,199
Airport started exactly exactly that so

2621
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:27,480
they basically now offer well now it's

2622
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,460
suspended but they started offering a

2623
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:31,860
van service which goes door to gate as

2624
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:33,540
it's called and it picks individual

2625
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,400
passengers and individual seats are

2626
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,500
offered and for some reason this is

2627
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:40,940
perfectly legal whereas the taxi drivers

2628
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:44,100
are apparently yeah engaging in an

2629
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:45,900
illegal activity

2630
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:49,920
no uh just uh just as a rebound do you

2631
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:52,739
know why flipko

2632
01:50:52,739 --> 01:50:54,900
um like implemented this but in a

2633
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:56,940
non-competitive way what I mean is that

2634
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:59,159
they're actually more expensive than the

2635
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:01,500
not that they're like informal of it

2636
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:04,440
because I think they they have a very

2637
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:07,260
different customer Target so people who

2638
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,780
would take an event that's also from my

2639
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:12,300
own work they would be very often of

2640
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:13,800
immigrant backgrounds so there's a lot

2641
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,300
of people from Eastern Europe from

2642
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:18,000
maghreb who are quite simply used to do

2643
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,440
this mode of Transport for them this is

2644
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,280
a very common thing to see

2645
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:26,159
and use in the country of origin

2646
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:29,520
and also they the drivers of the navette

2647
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,739
would basically find the customers on

2648
01:51:31,739 --> 01:51:33,480
the spot itself so you walk towards the

2649
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:34,920
bus I don't know if you've ever had that

2650
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,860
experience but uh whenever I had to walk

2651
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:39,080
to the bus

2652
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:42,659
or flipko and they would try to approach

2653
01:51:42,659 --> 01:51:45,000
you and convince you to ride with them

2654
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
whereas I think uh people who use the

2655
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,679
internet who have access to a website

2656
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:52,500
who can who know how to book a ride who

2657
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,800
have a credit card to book a ride

2658
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,239
that's uh yeah that's a different Target

2659
01:51:57,239 --> 01:51:59,540
group

2660
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:02,340
um so maybe that's why flipko can offer

2661
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:04,199
prices which are not exactly competitive

2662
01:52:04,199 --> 01:52:07,080
on the economic front

2663
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:09,000
um

2664
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,920
well but what it means that's the last

2665
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:13,260
sentence about the navette is that uh

2666
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:15,179
informality in this case it's some kind

2667
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:17,580
of a front for in this case State

2668
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:19,500
institutions to Define what's legal or

2669
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:22,860
not I mean for them to decide that the

2670
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:25,320
navage the informal drivers are informal

2671
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:28,500
and therefore legal and I mean it's an

2672
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,119
arbitrary decision to decide that this

2673
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:33,480
is informal whereas Uber is formal

2674
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,940
um or actually in the case of uber and

2675
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:37,980
Brussels authorities the regional

2676
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:39,780
authorities pretend that Uber does not

2677
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:41,100
exist

2678
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:43,199
so they don't chase it away but they

2679
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:45,780
also don't promote it which is a perfect

2680
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:48,420
playground for Uber they are they that's

2681
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:50,040
exactly what they want

2682
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:52,440
and they they are not interested in

2683
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:54,840
being recognized as an official public

2684
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,280
transport service for example because

2685
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:58,679
that would mean having to comply with a

2686
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:00,900
lot of regulations uh which they of

2687
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:04,159
course not interested in complying with

2688
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:07,260
in in your research about this do you

2689
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:10,260
know if like uber uh drivers partner up

2690
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:13,679
with the like informal Navid drivers to

2691
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:16,619
actually try to convince clients to use

2692
01:53:16,619 --> 01:53:18,659
the informal Navid rather than the

2693
01:53:18,659 --> 01:53:22,380
flipko for example no I don't no no I in

2694
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:23,699
this particular case they definitely not

2695
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:27,179
I mean the Navid drivers as most likely

2696
01:53:27,179 --> 01:53:29,280
taxi drivers in Brussels they hate Uber

2697
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,440
they really don't like that it exists

2698
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,119
because it basically eats into the

2699
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,980
market

2700
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:36,480
um I'm not saying the taxi driver is

2701
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,179
here you know some

2702
01:53:38,179 --> 01:53:42,300
angels and and uh most uh I don't know

2703
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:43,739
uh

2704
01:53:43,739 --> 01:53:46,739
uh fun well not fun people to work with

2705
01:53:46,739 --> 01:53:49,139
or on but uh I mean

2706
01:53:49,139 --> 01:53:52,380
they they can also uh offer services

2707
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:54,840
which are overpriced and and try to rip

2708
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:57,000
off tourists and and or I don't know

2709
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,699
people who come back home Intoxicated by

2710
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:01,320
you know taking a very long route or

2711
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,880
whatever with Uber of course the

2712
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,679
advantage is that you know the price

2713
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:07,139
before you get into the car more or less

2714
01:54:07,139 --> 01:54:09,119
but in this case no there's definitely

2715
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,400
no collaboration I would say that there

2716
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:13,320
is some conflict even

2717
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,940
uh

2718
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:17,159
uh you probably heard about that already

2719
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:19,020
happened at least three times massive

2720
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:21,380
strikes of taxi drivers against

2721
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:23,820
uh some kind of effort towards

2722
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,280
regularizing Uber by the Brussels

2723
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:30,619
Brussels Capital Region authorities

2724
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:36,540
any more questions comments

2725
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:40,080
well it also goes without saying that

2726
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:42,600
um at some point you will be picking uh

2727
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:46,080
topics for your master thesis and you

2728
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,940
are very welcome to pick some related to

2729
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:50,159
transport and Mobility either supervised

2730
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:51,719
by me or by other people there is some

2731
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:54,480
more in the in our team and in different

2732
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,699
departments as well but

2733
01:54:56,699 --> 01:54:59,520
um I don't know if I've succeeded

2734
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:03,420
probably to some extent but not fully

2735
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:06,060
but if this there was one thing that I

2736
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:07,500
really wanted you to understand about

2737
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,900
transported Mobility is that at least

2738
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:10,980
from the critical geographical

2739
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:13,260
perspective it's a really really diverse

2740
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:16,980
field there's plenty of things to to do

2741
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:18,480
um and there's plenty of interesting

2742
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:21,719
things to do so I yeah I really look

2743
01:55:21,719 --> 01:55:24,300
forward to seeing your research topics

2744
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:26,219
uh and hope that at least some of them

2745
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:28,580
will be related to transported Mobility

2746
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:31,260
and if you need some little push or some

2747
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:33,000
encouragement we are always there to

2748
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,619
help you with finding some interesting

2749
01:55:34,619 --> 01:55:37,500
literature for inspiration and whatnot

2750
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,940
so

2751
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:40,980
um I really really hope we meet in

2752
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,100
person one day uh I hope it's not uh too

2753
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,360
