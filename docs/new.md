[ Silence ]

00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:40,620
[BLANK_AUDIO]

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:48,820
All right, welcome everybody to

6
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,100
Urban Geography Urban Social Geography.

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,740
I had to work a little bit to make the live stream work.

8
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,860
I hope it does work.

9
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,020
Does anybody mind if I take off my mask?

10
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,780
Is that okay?

11
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,020
If anybody's uncomfortable, just let me know.

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,020
But I rely on my facial expressions for content.

13
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,740
How do you say that to transfer content, if you will?

14
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,420
So hi, I'm David for your lecture.

15
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,220
And welcome to the course.

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,420
I'm very glad that we can teach and have this in real life

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,100
in person.

18
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,580
We'll tell you more about the kind of hybrid character,

19
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,060
because we'll also be recording the sessions

20
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,500
and live streaming the session.

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,620
So I think the pandemic conditions are still

22
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,340
ongoing to allow if you would doubt

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,460
about any infection, et cetera, to follow the course remotely.

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,460
I think this can be more evident for the regular lectures like we have today.

25
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,460
There is also a number of discussions seminars.

26
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,460
There will be less evidence and there's also excursions for some there.

27
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:18,460
I mean, I can't stream an excursion, but for the lectures it will be now turned.

28
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,460
And you also have the recording at the end of the lecture series.

29
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,460
and this could be an interesting instrument to study.

30
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,460
So yeah, that also has students have used it last year.

31
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,460
Okay, so what are the objectives of the entire course,

32
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,460
urban geography, urban social geography?

33
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,460
Well, just summed up there.

34
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,460
I won't go too deep into this just here and now.

35
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,460
But just that you know what you're signing up for,

36
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,460
for the people that are still shopping around,

37
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,940
around, I would say.

38
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,340
The objective of the course is to give an introduction

39
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,700
to key theoretical debates in urban studies,

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,220
nor specifically focusing on spatial and geographical dimensions,

41
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,260
hence it's not introduction to urban studies

42
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,100
but introduction to urban geography.

43
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,780
And this is kind of signaling what

44
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,220
we find important as lecturers to adopt a theoretically

45
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,540
It's your list of approach to work urban studies.

46
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,940
You'll see that, and I'll get to that in a second,

47
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,700
that we work with different teachers, lectures.

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,300
We all have their own backgrounds,

49
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,660
and they may be slightly different.

50
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,980
Some people work more on political economy,

51
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,060
perspective, others start from adopting a perspective

52
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,420
from diversity and ethnicity,

53
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,420
yet others are interested in issues of culture,

54
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,900
in the broad sense, and always work in a kind of mobility framework.

55
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,660
I'm going to try to bring those things together in one course.

56
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,420
But what is kind of uniting the course,

57
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,660
I think a spatial social spatial understanding

58
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,300
of contemporary cities.

59
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,580
So that's what you're signing up for.

60
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,220
If you hate 50s, this is the moment to leave the room.

61
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,340
I told you so.

62
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,260
So this is the old male panel that we present to my

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:23,820
in serious apologies, but I think that hopefully diversity, of course the curriculum is a bit

64
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:32,700
better than within this course, but we're selecting from the people that can teach so please accept

65
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,660
my apologies for that, but still we hope that we can inform you from the range of perspectives.

66
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,180
Also, including I would say feminist perspectives, and they will pop up here and there,

67
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,220
especially when we start talking about issues of culture and issues of mobility and

68
00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:05,340
trans

69
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,180
Bosom HÃ¶rf, he's an expert, you could say,

70
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,500
creative industries, cultural geographies of the cities,

71
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,660
of the city, Poitek Geblowski, he wrote a PhD

72
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,780
on fair free public transportation,

73
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,900
and he's an expert in urban studies, slash transportation

74
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,060
geographies, and recently he's really pushing

75
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,220
for a kind of decolonial agenda in transport geographies.

76
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,540
And finally, there's me.

77
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,740
I won't say I'm an expert in editing.

78
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,380
I'm an expert in coordinating this course by now.

79
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,180
And I come from a background of world and global cities.

80
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,220
So what happens to cities, a mid-globalization,

81
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,180
how should we study that, analyze that,

82
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,020
well, I mean, debate.

83
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,820
Conversely, I've been looking a lot into the geographies

84
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,180
of Islamic finance as a way to understand,

85
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,140
I would say Middle Eastern processes of urbanization.

86
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,780
But that was my PhD.

87
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,820
Currently, I'm more working in teams

88
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,460
around financial companies, more widely thinking about

89
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,420
what typifies global cities as command and controls.

90
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,540
There's all kinds of things that I'll be killing you with

91
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,900
in the next few sessions.

92
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,340
So I won't say anything more about that.

93
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,060
So that's the teaching team.

94
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,380
And so there's plural voices to some extent.

95
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,380
And also there's also a plural audience.

96
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,940
So I was already referring to group students

97
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,980
by pointing to that this is the urban social geography course,

98
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,820
but also it's also the urban geography course.

99
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,300
And there's slight differences between both courses,

100
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,180
but especially for the lectures that

101
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,140
makes complete sense to bring you together in the room.

102
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,660
So we have the master in urban studies.

103
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,380
It will be master.

104
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,700
Please raise your hands and voices.

105
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,420
Okay, thanks for the hands.

106
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,340
This for citizens.

107
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,500
Yeah, so that's even more exotic.

108
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,780
These people travel around Europe in the next two years.

109
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,500
Then we have our own exotic species

110
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,180
from the Bachelor of Geography.

111
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,420
Maybe raise your hand.

112
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,060
Welcome.

113
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,780
And we also have urbanists in the room.

114
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,420
So please show me where you are.

115
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,060
These people also combine us with an actual job.

116
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,900
So that's also why we teach at night to accommodate that.

117
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,620
And these are people that have quite a bit of professional expertise.

118
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:56,540
So I would say this is already a global urban map here confined in this room.

119
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:03,220
I would say enjoy this mix and try to pick each other's brains as much as possible.

120
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,220
They're just by comparing urban experiences, concasal conversation.

121
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,460
You can already learn quite a bit.

122
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:21,500
So similarities, all students have lectures and discussion seminars.

123
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,980
This discussion seminar for capacity reasons will be split.

124
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,940
I'll tell you more about that.

125
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,660
For urban social geographers, so that's

126
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,060
for the mouse and urban cities and for citizens,

127
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,140
we're kind of new to Belgium.

128
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,660
We also offer kinds of excursions.

129
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,220
And I'll say more about that as well.

130
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,260
And these are mandatory.

131
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,380
And, follow.

132
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,620
So how does the course look like there's nine lectures,

133
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,540
which we will try to make as interactive as possible.

134
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,840
but there will be a degree of me and us telling you stuff.

135
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,740
The discussion seminars will be way more flipped,

136
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,540
if you will, where the content is prepared by you

137
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,140
and then we discussed this in the classroom.

138
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,580
So it's a bit of a give and take there.

139
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,940
We organized the lectures in modules.

140
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,300
So you can say this for modules.

141
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,420
One organized by me, which deals with

142
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:31,660
general introduction as you note today and then we'll delve into theories of world

143
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,780
and global cities looking at what explains their genesis what their

144
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:43,020
characteristics are, why matters and what kind of the main processes are that

145
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:48,700
characterize urban societies in world and global cities and one of the main

146
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:57,180
the base there is to what extent are these places polarized, either in terms of ethnicity,

147
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:06,260
income levels, professional levels, etc. With that sensitivity, I would say to an evenness

148
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:13,380
within cities, I'll pass on the word to Nick Schuirmont, who focus more on processes of urban

149
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,780
segregation, we're looking at the spatial processes behind that and one of the main debates

150
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:27,460
I would say in issues of diversity and ethnicity is to what extent there are neighborhood effects.

151
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:35,140
It is the fact that you live within a neighborhood affecting your future trajectories,

152
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,220
like chances, etc. So that's one of the main debates there and this

153
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,580
pros and cons, there's arguments for and against the existence of neighborhood effects.

154
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:54,180
Then we pass on to Bosch von HÃ¼d, who will be talking about, you could say, the cultural approach,

155
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:02,340
thinking about different cultures of urban research. And so this deals with various methods,

156
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:09,300
and mostly what you could say, an older cultural turn within geography and social sciences,

157
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,820
more widely, which was took place after Second World War.

158
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,460
And then more recently in the 80s and 90s,

159
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,620
to the real cultural turn where

160
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,780
was all about a turn towards more qualitative research methods,

161
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,820
other sources that could be studied

162
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,420
and that could serve the study

163
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,700
of urban societies.

164
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,220
And then this is also mobilized in the study

165
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,420
of urban culture, where it's about creative industries,

166
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,340
the lives of artists, et cetera,

167
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,000
which is a big element in a lot of,

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,840
say, this course is on the creative city.

169
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,440
As you may know, the work of Richard Florida,

170
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,440
it was a whole hype, I would say, 20 years ago

171
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,600
that all cities should be geared toward becoming creative

172
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
in one way or another.

173
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,080
So hence, also, a large focus and literature

174
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,000
on issues of ISP culture,

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
as it is connected to the shoes of urban development.

176
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,280
And then the final part is with Voigtek Blobsky,

177
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,600
looking into the lens of transport and mobility

178
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,640
at what we can learn about cities.

179
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,320
And he will be talking about different kinds of agendas

180
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,920
that typify, I would say,

181
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,920
transpities all the way from your classical views

182
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,200
that connected to urban growth development

183
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,640
to sustainability issues, which is a paradigm in an open zone.

184
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,560
And then he'll be drawing on his own research,

185
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,720
looking more into what he calls critical perspectives

186
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,880
on urban transport, where it's all about, yeah,

187
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,640
who actually benefits from the current transportation regime,

188
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,000
what are issues of inequality, who makes decisions

189
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,360
about in transport systems, I'd say.

190
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,440
So I think by the end, you should have a kind of

191
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:12,680
360 degree overview of debates in urban geography obviously. We don't know everything far from that.

192
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:19,720
So it's a selection of debates. We could generate another curriculum based with other forms of

193
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:27,000
expertise. But it's also an exercise in trying to critically try and relate different perspectives

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,320
on the city to different kind of teams which come with your own methodologies etc. So that's the

195
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:41,160
setup of the course and these take place here. You're just about fit in this room so I'm extremely

196
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:50,040
happy and pleased and we'll take place on Mondays between five and seven. Let's see what the quality

197
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,520
of the streaming is. If I would open for nocto which is my program I could expect a stream of

198
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,520
comments about that. But so I'll evaluate that but the idea is that everything is

199
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,840
streamed as well. People that come make it because of conflicts with work or

200
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,920
well they might have time but can't reach VB because it's immediately after

201
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,520
the working day I mean I would understand that you would yeah follow

202
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:27,160
remotely and sessions will also be recorded. On the other hand, it's a kind of

203
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:33,160
strict recommendation to try to be here as much as possible because I mean one of

204
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,960
the insights from the corona crisis, yeah, when you watch remotely, sometimes it's

205
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,120
hard to maintain discipline. I also recognize that with all kinds of Zoom meetings

206
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:53,920
and Zoom. I don't know, seven hours. So having a habit of coming to VDB, coming to class,

207
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,400
I think it's also a way to stay connected, but I don't know to the course content, but also to one

208
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:07,200
another. So you could fall back on this, but I would not recommend a full digital semester in any case.

209
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,480
So, but it's there and it will be your resource.

210
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
It all goes well at the very end.

211
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,960
So, yeah, we're here.

212
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,960
A bit more on the discussion seminar.

213
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,400
So, yes, please, there was a question.

214
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,240
(indistinct)

215
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,720
Yeah, it's to have some slack in this room.

216
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
We'll aim for two hours,

217
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,480
But we already started like five minutes late today.

218
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,040
So don't be upset if we take until 10 past seven.

219
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,800
But the idea is that it would be two hours.

220
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,720
Yeah, depends if the tone on what happens.

221
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,240
Yes?

222
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,720
[INAUDIBLE]

223
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,240
Excuse me?

224
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,720
Sorry.

225
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,760
[INAUDIBLE]

226
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,120
Yes, I'll post them online after each session.

227
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,240
Yeah, and if you go to the GUMVA stage and I guess some of you are not yet

228
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:15,720
be able to access convos that should be resorted quite soon. You'll see at the starting page

229
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,200
I made all kinds of modules as a kind of an outline module and there's a module per session

230
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,080
where you'll see

231
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,680
the required readings, some additional readings,

232
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,320
I'll post a link to, you know, I won't do it there.

233
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,120
I'll post a link to the recordings and the announcements.

234
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,720
There will be session slides linked to each of these modules.

235
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,920
So, I mean, I think it's neatly organized so you should find your way there.

236
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,120
Basically, all content will be provided online for people that cannot access

237
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:02,120
convos yet. Please find somebody who has access and try to share, I would say the course outline.

238
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:09,480
So please be aware that some of you don't have access yet. I think by next week it should be

239
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:19,880
okay. So yeah, let's see. So yeah, next in the lectures there's discussion seminars where we

240
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:27,720
basically use the reader to advance our insight into these discussions around urban geography.

241
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,680
And we take the various modules, so four modules, and we organize that in one block,

242
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,280
where we'll have a discussion which is basically prepared by you all in different kind of

243
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:44,360
smaller presentations, and then we have a collective discussion about that. It's also in the

244
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,960
an outline. So it's a different kind of series of discussion seminars because you can't

245
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:56,480
have a debate with 200 people in the room. So it's more like a classroom format, one

246
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,360
for the master in urban studies, one track for four cities, and then also one for geography

247
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:09,080
first and urbanists in one go. For must and for cities, it won't be on Mondays, it's

248
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,760
some different times during the week.

249
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,960
It's in your time schedule.

250
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,320
Please check if you've already identified

251
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
where the time schedule is.

252
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,480
Also where the week information is.

253
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,400
And try to notice down in your agenda,

254
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,720
because there will be an assignment later that, a small one.

255
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,080
But I would say an important one.

256
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,840
Please note that down in your agenda.

257
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Also note that the lectures at some point will have three lectures now, but then we will skip one week before we go to the next module, then two classes, then we skip one week, etc, etc.

258
00:18:49,160 --> 00:19:02,160
And it is because on certain Mondays after module will have a discussion seminar with geographers and urbanists because it's, we can't expect work students to be here during the day.

259
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,460
So we will take these Mondays and also please take notes for

260
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:13,860
most enforcities that you don't have to show up for, I would say, four sessions

261
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,040
on Mondays. I mean you're welcome to join, but there will be no lectures, there

262
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,440
will be discussion seminars for a not a group, okay? Just so you know, it could be a

263
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,600
week also to prepare another bit more for the discussion seminar that you

264
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,200
you may have yourself. Okay, I'll say more about the assignment linked to that in

265
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,120
seconds. Then urban social geography excursions, there's a lot of administration here apparently.

266
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,160
We offer four excursions but because of the size of the group this is for must and for cities

267
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:56,160
will have to, yeah, force you to make a choice. So there's four excursions, one led by me,

268
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,280
and here in Brussels which the with Brussels has a global city.

269
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,120
Nick Schuetman takes you to enter to deal with issues of social and ethnic segregation.

270
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,680
Mind that this is a bike trip.

271
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:14,000
So maybe some of you are less comfortable with biking, just taking to account.

272
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,880
Others may be extremely experienced and fight the rates to slow and also don't want to join.

273
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:31,880
then there's an excursion to Shellrva again by Nick and then Voitek will take you on an excursion in Brussels around the team of everyday mobility.

274
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,880
So for excursions you have to choose to.

275
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,880
This is also something that I mentioned in this Google Sheets or Spectsheets.

276
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,480
try to go for one Brussels excursion and one other excursion because you want to kind of

277
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,240
give everybody opportunity to go beyond Brussels otherwise your remains stuck in the Brussels bubble.

278
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:04,120
So there's please select either and to a I would say or either shall it run. Yes.

279
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:12,520
The answer by trade is actually right how about the Wilfern-RÃ¶ssen pointer? No. No.

280
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,800
- Okay, thank you, I'm gonna go by train.

281
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,760
And then I don't think it's even the entire day,

282
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,240
but at some point I'll go to the luck ball,

283
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,760
which is kind of a social housing product project

284
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,280
from I think the 60s, if I'm not mistaken,

285
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,720
and to reach that, you'll go by bike.

286
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,560
Yeah, some people feel less comfortable doing that.

287
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,680
You could also say we have one month to get trained.

288
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,160
And in the case, it could be an opportunity.

289
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,520
But take this into account.

290
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,020
Yes.

291
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,880
What was the question?

292
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,200
[INAUDIBLE]

293
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,840
No, no, no, no.

294
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,360
Yeah.

295
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,640
Well, there's a bike rental.

296
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,200
Yeah.

297
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,120
Nick has arranged bikes.

298
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,800
Are there any other questions about this?

299
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,280
Not yet.

300
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,960
No, but typically, I mean, this would be communicated.

301
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,760
They started in the early morning and the end at the end of the day.

302
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah, but it's a full day.

303
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,840
Same.

304
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,360
OK.

305
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,160
So please go to this spreadsheet and project

306
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:47,360
preferences. All right. Okay, I hope this the skills it. So fill out your preferences as soon as

307
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,320
possible and no later than next week. Okay, so there's limited capacity for each of these

308
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:03,840
versions so please take care of it. All right a bit more about the course materials

309
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:13,040
as you will see on Kungvas there's a reader which what I call required readings so I expect

310
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:20,320
everybody reads this at least once and preferably in advance of an advance of each lecture

311
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,480
It's kind of way to keep track of the discussion.

312
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,240
And there will also be additional readings.

313
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,840
And these additional readings will kind of be the resource that we will use in the discussion

314
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
so please.

315
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:42,120
Yeah, the rest I've said already, session slides and recordings available for each session.

316
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,840
And then this is weird.

317
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,920
And then you have access via conference.

318
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,400
A bit more about evaluation and great distribution.

319
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,280
So this assignment in this question seminar

320
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:05,200
is a critical summary and it accounts for one fifth of your total grade.

321
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,400
So it's a kind of a way to be remunerated if you will for your efforts during the semester.

322
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,240
But the whole idea is that we digest our way through the literature and through the

323
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,200
reader, that we do this in a collective way.

324
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,400
So what is the assignment?

325
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,360
All students have to read the required readings.

326
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:37,840
But then I have no idea what to do actually.

327
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Let me just check this is off.

328
00:24:44,840 --> 00:25:06,720
Okay, let's just try to continue.

329
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,960
So per two, you'll be invited to critically summarize one additional reading, so it could be

330
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,000
a paper on Baywood, for instance, when we're talking about global cities.

331
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,560
And yeah, I'll announce a schedule for that.

332
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,840
You'll have a ten minutes of presentation.

333
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,800
And what you're asked to do is that you focus on a core quote or passage or excerpt from

334
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,560
the text that you kind of use this as an introduction to the text that you tell us all about

335
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:46,040
the main argument of the authors, that you connect this to the wider debate or the literature

336
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,600
that we've been discussing, yeah, we've been talking about women in local cities.

337
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Yeah.

338
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,760
How do you connect this particular study that we're reading about?

339
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,360
And then toward the end, you want to give some kind of a critical reflection.

340
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
So you can also start with the critical reflection

341
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,160
and weave that through the entire presentation,

342
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,560
but you should end with a number of discussion questions

343
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,440
which we can then use to kickstart the debate.

344
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,040
So 10 minutes, you give kind of a crash or summary

345
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,000
of what the paper is about, why matters,

346
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,040
what we learn from it, and how we connect that

347
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,400
to the discussions that we're ready to have.

348
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,960
So that's the critical summary,

349
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,600
a bit more on that in a second.

350
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,600
We do have a presentation at home.

351
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Yes.

352
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
OK.

353
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Because otherwise it will be endless through a presentation.

354
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,600
It's something that you can do with too.

355
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,600
So yeah, it's both of you should take the floor at some point.

356
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,600
So there's a different balance exercise.

357
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,600
And also try to make this an integrated exercise,

358
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,600
not somebody, one person saying, OK,

359
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Okay, this is the argument, but then the other person not knowing the argument, but having come up with the neural fresh. So to give a stupid example, that's not the idea. So to really try to discuss and text together and come to some kind of a shared understanding there and already debating this amongst the two of you.

360
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,600
We will really be something worked while I think.

361
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Yeah, and then the largest part of the evaluation is a written exam.

362
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:31,600
And this is basically a way to test, you could say, your knowledge of urban,

363
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,600
of the urban theories and concepts that we've been discussing throughout the semester,

364
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
throughout different modules.

365
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,600
There's no particular focus on memorizing things by heart,

366
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:53,600
But it's about mobilizing your knowledge to study empirical examples cases, etc.

367
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,600
And I think we'll give examples of that throughout the course.

368
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:09,600
For instance, when you think about culture as an essay, say, urban development strategy,

369
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,720
We may get a question about this in you, santra, don't be due.

370
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,360
Santra can now be due next to the Brussels Canal Zone.

371
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,600
To what extent is this a case of cultural regeneration?

372
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,800
Discuss.

373
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,360
And then you would have to interpret the case on that base.

374
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,920
So it's not just about reproduction.

375
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
That's about applying what you've learned,

376
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,520
critically reflecting on the different concepts, etc.

377
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:47,520
And you'll use the readings, the slides, the recordings, personal notes from seminars and lectures.

378
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:59,520
And yeah, those who write on a disc of my excursion can also always refer to the filters to actually get a bit of more inspiration.

379
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,520
So that's the setup of the great distribution.

380
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,520
And yeah, a bit more still about this critical summary.

381
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Just a number of questions that you could use as a source of inter-age inspiration or a template.

382
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,520
So what is the key message from the paper?

383
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Why is it important? What is the key argument? What have you learned?

384
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,520
And really try to be as nuanced as possible.

385
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Can you compare the argument being made with other perspectives or perspective from the required readings or anything

386
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:47,520
[BLANK_AUDIO]

387
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
>> You have found important?

388
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,520
>> Yeah, this is going to be a real sound.

389
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
>> Yeah, I have no idea.

390
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:02,520
>> When I move, I have you pressure.

391
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Okay, let's try to continue.

392
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Yeah?

393
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Yeah.

394
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Okay.

395
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,520
I wonder what was happening.

396
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,520
I wonder what was happening.

397
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,520
We're seeing out in the background.

398
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,520
I think maybe, you know, it might sink in some of the stuff.

399
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Okay.

400
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,400
You're everything that would be the case?

401
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
And the appearance.

402
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Good everybody's supposed to have the phones.

403
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
It's definitely option.

404
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,400
It's like 100 phones being switched off. Is that possible to try?

405
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Yeah, but I don't really find it. I think it's necessary.

406
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:03,400
But yeah, I think that's what I can do actually.

407
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Maybe yeah, let's try. Okay, maybe you'll have to lift it or I can sort it out later.

408
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:26,440
later. What happens to break? Go this one.

409
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:55,440
[Music]

410
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,280
Let's see.

411
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Excuse me.

412
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,120
[INAUDIBLE]

413
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,560
And knowingly.

414
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,840
OK, I'm not a genius.

415
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,120
This is clear right now.

416
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,360
All right.

417
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,760
And then, yeah, final point that I already

418
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,680
said is try to think the debate.

419
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,720
That's what it's all about in the end.

420
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
OK?

421
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,480
[INAUDIBLE]

422
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,800
No, you have to do this once.

423
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,300
Yeah, so what I'll do is as soon as I have the full overview is who are actually taking this course, make a schedule.

424
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,000
And then you'll have to present once with somebody else.

425
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,500
Yeah.

426
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:54,600
It's not on canvas. It's a different kind of Google sheets, but you can click the link in the slides that I just showed.

427
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,360
So, when you're a little bit different.

428
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,040
Yeah.

429
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,120
But that, those who don't have access to come

430
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:09,120
for us may be asked somebody who has to share this link

431
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,880
or just ask somebody to sign you up via this link.

432
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,480
OK.

433
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,720
Is that clear?

434
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,640
Was there a whole lot of administration

435
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,600
sorry for that?

436
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,160
But that's how it goes, I guess.

437
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,320
So I hope everything is clear. Yes, please.

438
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:37,720
Yeah, but I'll make the distribution.

439
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,680
Yeah, because otherwise if we do this bottom up, then

440
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,000
it will be very, very difficult.

441
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,520
So well, yeah, but all texts are interesting, I would say.

442
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,640
So that's the idea.

443
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,680
But it might take a while because I think for most enforceities

444
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,840
quite clear.

445
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,000
So that could go fast.

446
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,980
Maybe for geographers and staff, it

447
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,000
could last a little bit longer because sometimes it's unclear

448
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
who is actually in the course.

449
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,520
But for most enforceities, I think this

450
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,160
can go actually quite fast.

451
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,960
And then you can also plan a little bit working semester.

452
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,480
OK.

453
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,400
All right.

454
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,120
So let's turn to some content then.

455
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,680
And let's start a trip.

456
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,440
What we'll be discussing in earnest today

457
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,280
is basically what we'll do is we'll deconstruct the title

458
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,800
course and ask for questions.

459
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,040
What is the urban?

460
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,240
What is the city?

461
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,320
What is geography?

462
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,280
And what does it mean when I say I'm critical?

463
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,080
Arguably critical is not in the title,

464
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,720
but it could have been.

465
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,120
It may seem nonsensical, but I think asking these very

466
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,320
blue sky questions perhaps could get us

467
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,320
closer to what understanding what urban geography is about.

468
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,120
So you can also start already starting

469
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,840
a little bit about what we would mean

470
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,640
in the term the urban and the city.

471
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,400
And maybe as I take you to a number of exhibits,

472
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,120
you can draw some inspiration for that,

473
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,560
and you can make a list.

474
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,000
And then in a few minutes, you'll

475
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,920
be invited to write a very short, one-minute paper.

476
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,000
It doesn't have to be pros, where you collect

477
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,080
a little bit of ideas on what those two terms put me.

478
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,760
Let's get started a bit.

479
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,100
You probably, and one of the reasons,

480
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,660
why some of you have studies,

481
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,660
was selected the Muslim urban studies or four cities,

482
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:55,140
is because you have been seduced by a discourse

483
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,500
or a frame of relief in the urban age,

484
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,380
processes occur increasingly in cities,

485
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,300
therefore we need to understand cities

486
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,780
if we want to make sense of our futures,

487
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,420
or something like that.

488
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,780
And this would be some kind of a framework or repertoire

489
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,780
That's the world that the United Nations

490
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,780
sorry calls a framework of the urban age.

491
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,780
And it's a kind of frame that says,

492
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,780
well, we've long been a, you could say,

493
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,780
rural global population or rural species.

494
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,780
But at some point,

495
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
and someday in 2005,

496
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,780
we became an urban species and ever since,

497
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,780
basically rural population growth

498
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,580
will be urban growth.

499
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,780
So increasingly, we're undergoing

500
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,140
as a global society of growth, of urbanization,

501
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,140
where more and more people become urban.

502
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,180
So this kind of mantra of the urban age

503
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,220
has been around since about 2007,

504
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,580
so immediately after this historical urban transition.

505
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,980
And it has been repeated as a kind of a motivation

506
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,700
for increased attention to cities.

507
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:18,700
So, and there's something behind that obviously because there is indeed a transition to the urban and it's observable here in Berkeley.

508
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Roughly in the 1950s, about 70% of the population global population lived in rural areas and only 30% in urban areas.

509
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:39,740
It was 50/50 apparently around 2005 and now it's reversed or it's going to be reversed by 2050.

510
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,620
Expectation is that 70% of the global population will live in cities.

511
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:53,820
So that's kind of the framework of the urban age that is very much projected by

512
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,820
by United Nations, by all kinds of world reports,

513
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,980
and that is kind of taken over by both critical

514
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,740
and more uncritical voices and debate.

515
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,420
McKinsey would also use this to argue for more consultancy

516
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,580
into urban governance.

517
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:19,700
But just as much like Davis, when it talks about cities

518
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:28,380
slums, it uses as a critical framework to make his work in court.

519
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:36,820
So what is behind this is an assumed process or an identifiable process of globalized urbanization.

520
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:44,700
So the process by which the urban condition, if you will, is becoming a global phenomenon.

521
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,700
urbanization used to be something that was not global at all.

522
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:59,380
And if you look at a few maps by Michael Pachoning, has a great handbook on cities.

523
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:06,140
You see that it was very much, say, a Western European or Northern American affair.

524
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:16,300
So UK was extremely urbanized, European continent, also quite and US as well.

525
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:21,500
Apparently, a lost color is also extremely urbanized.

526
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:27,500
The rest of the world was on the map, but not really on the map of urbanization.

527
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,580
It didn't occur there.

528
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,580
Bam.

529
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:37,780
forward to the 1950s you see that this process is spreading, especially you could say throughout

530
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:44,340
your being continents, throughout the Commonwealth, you see Australia and kind of popping up

531
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:56,420
also you could say more developed mentalists say in Latin America, USSR and to a very very limited extent

532
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:06,420
Africa and then especially the market. Not so much in Asia as you can see. We're moving forward

533
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:16,660
in 1990s. We see that this process is both extending geographically and intensified. So a lot of

534
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:23,140
countries or quite a few countries in Europe have now an urbanization rate, apparently between 80

535
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:30,500
and 100%, which is kind of the ratio between population that lives in cities on the total population.

536
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:36,740
So between 80 and 100% of people live in cities according to these definitions.

537
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:45,780
Again, note Australia, it's a tremendously organized continent, if you will.

538
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,340
Obviously this is a projection of the ratio on the entire territory.

539
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,340
Okay, so almost all Australians live in cities,

540
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,940
but that doesn't mean that the entirety of Australia is a city.

541
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,140
Maps could lie, some extent.

542
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,540
So we may be exaggerating some things when we think about

543
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:13,940
the use of natural resources or environmental impact.

544
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,840
That's something that we could think about.

545
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,100
What is also important is kind of a different kind of figure,

546
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,660
is that there's some kind of a decoupling

547
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,580
between processes of one of the better words,

548
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,700
economic growth or what some people call

549
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,340
more problematic development and urbanization.

550
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,500
When you go back to say the history of urbanization

551
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,060
in the 19th century, it was a process that was intimately

552
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,100
linked to industrialization, economic growth,

553
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,860
But also obviously as we know, uneven development within West

554
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,660
New York being cities.

555
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,060
There was a lot of economic development in the UK.

556
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,180
Cities like Manchester, because there was a group of the textile

557
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,220
industry that led to economic growth.

558
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,300
But it also led to huge urban inequalities.

559
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,860
But in any case, at the aggregate level,

560
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,180
you could say, at the level of the country,

561
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,180
or the city, there wasn't an economic improvement.

562
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,580
and that's connected to the growth of these cities.

563
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,200
What you find in, you could say, the last 20 years

564
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,340
and this has something to do with all kinds

565
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,540
of neoliberal policies that work at the global scale,

566
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,980
especially when you talk about Asia and Africa.

567
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,780
You could say the strategic adjustment plans

568
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,700
that have been rolled out there by organizations such as

569
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,700
the International Monetary Fund

570
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,700
and it's a sister of brother, the World Bank,

571
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,300
which has basically opened up the borders

572
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,340
of these countries before an investment

573
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,180
as this which kickstart growth, okay?

574
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,740
In reality, one could argue that this has produced

575
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,180
a dependent form of growth,

576
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,460
or it's an exploitative relation

577
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,180
between the global periphery and the global core, okay?

578
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,780
But at the same time has initiated

579
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,660
and this is kind of the argument by my Davis,

580
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,060
an implosion of the countryside, rural living

581
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:24,260
in these places became untenable

582
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,980
because a lot of, say, subsidized activities

583
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,660
or state controlled activities were rolled back,

584
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,460
for instance, in agriculture.

585
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,660
This led to huge deprivation on the countryside

586
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,500
and in varying degrees, a search to grow

587
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,740
for the better life and a lot of African neutrides.

588
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,740
So if we told that it could be a sign of economic development,

589
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,740
you could say in the 19th century, and even if we take up

590
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,740
with a pinch of salt, that's still not possible to say in when you talk

591
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,740
about urbanization rates, for instance, in Africa, or parts of Asia.

592
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,740
Okay.

593
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:08,740
Now, so, and if you look at the rates of urbanization,

594
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:15,900
We're talking about 7% to 8% in some sub-Saharan African countries, whereas if you look at

595
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:23,620
older industrial areas or urbanized areas, it's somewhere between 1% and 2% still growth.

596
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:30,580
So with doubling, I would say in 36 years, if it's 2%, but far far less.

597
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:37,860
So yes, globalized urbanization that also shows, and then you look at the

598
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:47,940
list of largest cities. It was very much Euro-American if you will. The industrial

599
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:57,100
hard-life, hard-lands, some exceptions Shanghai for instance, Japan, 1950s. But then it

600
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:07,340
It starts to really diversify and become actually a matter of not Euro-America, but Asia, Latin

601
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:14,040
America, and a number of leading cities in terms of population in the 1950s, and now well

602
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,820
down the list, take New York, for instance, others.

603
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:23,460
So this kind of thesis that urbanization is now a globalized phenomenon.

604
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,460
There are still different kinds of patterns behind that.

605
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:34,460
Just you can look into this at home because it may be a bit small to actually read here.

606
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:41,460
Some places when you look at Europe, we're talking about 80% urbanization.

607
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:47,460
Still in Africa despite its large urbanization rate,

608
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,460
still for most rural society.

609
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:57,260
So even despite the kind of a global transition toward globalized urbanization,

610
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,860
there's quite a bit of regional differences that we need to take into account.

611
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,460
And that brings me to the next slide.

612
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,460
This famous image that I stole it from Neil Brenner,

613
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:18,860
where Batman beats the crap out of Robin because he begins to talk about this urban age again.

614
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:26,220
I think it's a moment to really question critically what is meant by the urban ancient, to

615
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:31,500
what extent we should really believe and go along in this urban age frame.

616
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,340
And a very nice paper I haven't put it in the reader because there's already quite a

617
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:39,340
bit of things in there.

618
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:47,060
Is the paper by Neil Brenner and Christian Smith from 2014 and they really deconstruct this

619
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:55,780
narrative and they pointed to elements. One is the notion or the idea or the

620
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,380
observation that we're living in the urban age could be a statistical

621
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:06,260
artifact. So it's a matter of how we measure things and there's actually quite a

622
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:14,180
bit of divergence over time but also across countries as to how a city is

623
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:24,980
actually measured. In some contexts there's a city, something counts as a city as of 1,000 inhabitants.

624
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:33,380
In other countries it would be 10,000 and it would have a tremendous impact on how we calculate the urbanization.

625
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:43,340
So this is more fundamentally what an argument is that there's a huge nationalist bias in how the urban

626
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,460
is defined.

627
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,940
I'm not saying that there's 200 definitions,

628
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:53,700
but for instance, when you look at the work of organizations

629
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,980
like United Nations, they have been struggling

630
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:01,500
to set a standard definition of what the urban is.

631
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,220
There's still quite a bit of diversity.

632
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,300
And when you look at the work of urban geographers

633
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,940
for the past 50 or 60 years, this is a kind of recurring issue.

634
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:15,940
So what they say is that, yes, there are real empirical caps

635
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,540
knowledge here of the rate of urbanization.

636
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:24,700
And therefore, it's almost meaningless to say

637
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,380
in some day, in 2005, we became more urban,

638
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,300
I'll repine now our urban species.

639
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,740
So it's kind of, yes, there's a broad trajectory

640
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:40,700
toward urbanization, but there's a very large bandwidth

641
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,700
that we should consider.

642
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:48,940
And in fact, it could be more interesting to look at different kind of urbanization trajectories

643
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:54,140
because it's dealing with all kinds of different processes that need to be studied as

644
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,860
historically unfolding

645
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:00,420
rather just than being captured in a figure of

646
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:05,500
75% for it. So it's more of an invitation. It's not looking at it.

647
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,700
So there's also connects to the second argument is that

648
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:18,040
The urban, as it is being measured by a process of urbanization, is so much of a chaotic

649
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,580
abstraction.

650
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:27,780
It means that different kind of things that are not necessarily related are packed together

651
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,700
to define a certain process.

652
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,820
And this is something that, for instance, a new Brenner and Christmas month have also worked

653
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:42,820
on later as the discussion of planetary urbanization, I invite you to look into that debate.

654
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:49,340
Their argument is that the urban, in fact, as a condition, as a way of life, or as a system

655
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:56,940
of production or exploitation does not neatly overlay actual morphologies of cities.

656
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:06,900
So the urban may have nothing to do with a concentrated blob of people in space or with

657
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,340
sitting within a particular jurisdiction.

658
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,900
It could be connected to suburbs, et cetera.

659
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:19,220
So what they kind of are concerned with is when you talk about a race of urbanization,

660
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:26,820
is that you classify or categorize quite diverse ways of living into one category of

661
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:32,020
the urban and even more problematic.

662
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,300
So hence we don't really learn anything about it.

663
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,700
And what is even more problematic is that the rural is defined

664
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:43,060
as the non-urban and is nearby.

665
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,020
Yeah, not studied at all as kind of the left behind place,

666
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:50,540
that only exists in opposition to what really counts, which

667
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,820
is then the way forward, which is urban living.

668
00:50:53,820 --> 00:51:01,700
So that's kind of their argument, just to kick start a little bit to your thinking on this,

669
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:07,100

744

is that you have some combination of that

you might make my next slide completely redundant.

753
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:48,860
So yeah, one of the ideas and important say,

754
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,420
I mean with revolutionary, it's kind of a sensitivity

755
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,540
that the urban and citizens are not necessarily the same.

756
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:00,420
I think the point is not to say or to define clearly

757
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,620
what a city is or the urban is,

758
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,100
but to offer different kind of perspectives,

759
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:11,820
different kind of lenses on the question.

760
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,980
and by offering different kind of perspectives

761
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,220
or emerging from different kind of questions,

762
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,820
we may actually learn more about the process of urbanization.

763
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:25,540
So there's not kind of one ruling explanation,

764
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,580
but there's many ways of looking at it.

765
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,660
But I think, yeah, we'll get to something more.

766
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:37,660
So one idea is that it's about a concentration,

767
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:41,300
people, it's also about the concentration of stuff.

768
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,860
lump of material, the built environment.

769
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,700
Yeah, so it's something with density,

770
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,260
something else, so a lot of I think urbanists would recognize,

771
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,500
so it's the built environment, built up space

772
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,420
that really gives morphological signs that at some point

773
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,620
we have arrived in the city.

774
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:05,620
We at high rises be a lot of congestion

775
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,740
that would be markers of characteristics of folks.

776
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,620
So that's kind of not necessarily urban,

777
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:16,100
but kind of a marker of what is acid.

778
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,060
Then, stretching a little bit more into,

779
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,100
you can say the overlays between what is urban

780
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:28,160
and how it's deep borders, cities.

781
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:33,180
Cities are sometimes defined as the opposite

782
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:36,060
of the non-city, as I was saying,

783
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,460
as the opposite of the rural.

784
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,900
And then a number of planning context,

785
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,380
I'm thinking about, for instance, the Netherlands.

786
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,020
It will actually be, if you look at the satellite image,

787
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,740
it will be identifiable where one urban area ends

788
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,980
and there's country side and then something else starts.

789
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:58,380
But yeah, in many contexts,

790
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,820
especially in the lavish one, for instance,

791
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,460
this is a reality where you won't get really far.

792
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:07,620
It's kind of, you're not sure where the city ends.

793
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:12,620

794

01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,780

outside of the core areas of urban agglomerations.

799
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:34,180

of activities and suburbs.

01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:49,100
it generates all kinds of fuzzy categories.

We haven't covered this yet, so maybe we're talking about this.

809
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:34,180
So it's, yeah, the urban or a city is the place of an urban life, but perhaps the urban

810
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:37,980
also stretches beyond the city itself.

811
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:42,620
So urban living could also be taking place in the suburbs.

812
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:50,780
But it's some kind of an idea that within the spaces, a different kind of society and

813
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:56,460
in a different kind of behavior, norms, values, and take place.

814
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:03,740
So it's a distinctive way of life, but still it could be a very different kind of energy

815
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:11,100
that we may be talking about or a different kind of bonds that actually ties people together.

816
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:14,980
So just compare slum living with loft living.

817
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:22,740
It's a very distinct way of urban living, but they both be characterized as something else

818
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,940
than rural living.

819
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:30,460
So and there's this big debate, I would say, in urban sociology, between what is now

820
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:36,940
distinct about the urban way of life at a some kind of an assumption that you move from

821
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,460
community to society.

822
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:45,260
communities think about rural communities where you have all kinds of personal relations

823
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:49,460
with neighbors, small villages.

824
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:55,940
And this gets formalized and nullomized as soon as you get to cities because distances become

825
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:00,700
larger because there's all kinds of institutional roles.

826
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:04,100
There's a division of labor that we'll get to in a second.

827
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,460
And it becomes more abstract.

828
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:12,540
take a certain function within society which is less mediated by social relations. That was kind

829
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:19,180
of the argument by a lot of sociologists also in the 19th century that try to capture the process

830
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:25,820
of urbanization. So it's a distinctive way of life. It's not just buildings and homes of material.

831
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:33,660
It's more than that. Another way of looking at it and with Hintonad, by you here at Front,

832
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:38,660
It's also about economic relations that tie together people.

833
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:44,660
I think about flows of energy, flows of work, flows of ideas,

834
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:50,860
flows of data that connects the inhabitants of a certain place.

835
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:56,260
And it would be more agglomerated in some places than others,

836
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:59,460
but they wouldn't be necessarily confined to,

837
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,460
you could say, the core of metropolitan areas.

838
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:31,860
So the city is also the place where divisions of labour emerge and there's this famous picture by Adam Smith's needle factory or pin factory, where cities are kind of a microcosm of a workshop where different kind of tasks that used to be integrated in thin making are kind of cut up and collectively places produce a certain economic problem.

839
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:41,860
So this inputs needed by different suppliers, different kind of specialized workers to end up with a product.

840
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:51,860
So historically that has been a way where open elites could emerge that could also kind of manage this process,

841
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:58,860
that could also absorb part of the surplus that was being generated by a more efficient

842
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:04,860
division of labor, standardization of work, for instance, and was also, you can say,

843
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:12,860
a more critical framework of the place where uneven development and urban inequalities actually have their origins.

844
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:19,860
So it produced more efficiency, it increased the urban surplus, if you will, but not everybody benefited.

845
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:24,860
So a complex division of labor, the idea that there are

846
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:29,860
agglomeration effects by being in a certain place,

847
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,860
economic agents for instance, will benefit from their presence

848
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,860
because they have specialized inputs.

849
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:41,860
That's kind of the realm of economic geographies that try to capture

850
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,860
that process.

851
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:47,860
And now obviously when you talk about divisions of labor,

852
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,400
about these energies that go around,

853
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,360
these also structure urban spaces

854
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,780
and you could say urban class relations

855
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:58,420
in a particular way.

856
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:03,420
So you could apply some kind of regulations perspective here

857
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,620
thinking about,

858
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:11,140
we could say different eras of cities

859
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:16,260
as being engaged in particular production processes,

860
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:23,380
recapitalist cities, for instance, the top left, then the typical newly industrializing

861
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:29,500
cities top right, then going bottom left to 40 cities.

862
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:35,220
And then you could say contemporary cities that are kind of both exploded and imploded

863
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,860
at the same time with rising densities at the edges.

864
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:44,100
And also a re-entensification of built up areas in the very core and return of activities

865
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,100
there.

866
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:50,500
a regular regulation perspective is also what Dorian Massey

867
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,460
would be talking about.

868
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:55,060
She was a famous economic geographer,

869
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,500
economic geographer from 1980s.

870
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,220
She was also one of the main critical voices

871
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:04,620
and trying to understand how particular forms of capitalism

872
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:08,500
leave their imprint on society in general

873
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,180
and on urban societies in particular.

874
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:12,580
She was interested in regions, but it also

875
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,820
can be applied to cities.

876
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,420
So yeah, you had a really very high rock

877
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,300
go to society in general.

878
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,300
I mean, there's a huge generalization here

879
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,020
in medieval cities where the core wasn't

880
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:29,780
elite realm with some domestic servants.

881
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,300
Then there was a kind of a layer of the lower classes,

882
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,460
and then basically the outcomes with a number

883
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,540
of ethnic communities.

884
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:40,300
This is a huge generalization, but it's kind of a guiding

885
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,140
model that is it's set to hold.

886
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,700
When you think about industrializing cities,

887
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:50,780
it was kind of thing and this is Chicago for sure.

888
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:55,180
I will be talking a bit more about Chicago as it became a model

889
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:58,940
of the industrial city in the early 20th century.

890
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:02,460
A lot of industrial activity in the commercial

891
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:07,580
part of the city and then radiating out

892
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,820
in terms of, you could say, class,

893
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,420
his working man's houses and then further on,

894
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,820
more elite cities, people, neighborhoods, people

895
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,860
that could actually afford to commute to the city set.

896
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:24,020
Then after the second world tour,

897
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,700
actually, like at the bottom left,

898
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,940
it's kind of a gorgeous city where capitalism was

899
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,020
regulated in a particular way,

900
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:34,340
where the surplus that was being created

901
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,540
by capitalist production, think about all these factories

902
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:41,300
Mass production was being shared by the working class.

903
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:44,220
So this is kind of a typical American dream.

904
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,660
It can provide the American cities,

905
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,700
but friends also can provide European cities

906
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:52,420
where we had a massive round of serverization,

907
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,060
the good life where you could live far removed

908
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:00,500
from where you were, commute by car,

909
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,700
and it was a way to kind of spatially redistribute

910
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,340
the surface that was being generated in cities.

911
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:12,060
And that's a kind of a Harvey and David Harvey interpretation

912
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,580
of suburbanization.

913
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,500
It's not just a lifestyle.

914
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,740
It's also a spatial form of how capitalism

915
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:22,420
of in that period worked.

916
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:26,780
And then kind of finally, this kind of growth

917
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,100
at the periphery.

918
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,300
We see a kind of an outward movement,

919
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,300
you can see the urbanization of suburbanism.

920
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:36,180
All kinds of knowledge and densities

921
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,740
and then starting to take place at the edges,

922
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:44,100
all of city centers that are losing functions,

923
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,740
this kind of historical process in the 70s and 80s,

924
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:49,860
lot of derelict areas, ground food areas,

925
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:52,540
which are then in subsequent decades,

926
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:55,780
increasingly becoming the places where you have waves

927
01:09:55,780 --> 01:10:00,060
of gentrification, a return of capital to city centers,

928
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,060
et cetera, et cetera.

929
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:06,140
And admit all this, and I'm trying to hugely summarize

930
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,140
and generalized here, because it's

931
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,340
a kind of ideal typical approach, diversity that

932
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,820
is increasing in a lot of cities,

933
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:20,540
new pockets of exclusiveness and exclusion

934
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,300
on the other hand.

935
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:25,460
So cities also becoming increasingly polarized.

936
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:29,500
So the urban is different depending

937
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,420
on the period you're talking about.

938
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,180
It could be characterized differently,

939
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:42,180
depending on where you are and in what period you're talking about.

940
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:53,420
Bottom left and right? Yeah, you could say that. I mean, in some handbooks it would be called

941
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:59,900
the Fortis City, this one. And this would be the post-40 city, which is exactly the

942
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:05,900
This is not one identifiable core in the metropolitan area.

943
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:11,900
Whereas this was still very much in relation to the core, but it captures different.

944
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,900
You could call it modernity.

945
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:22,900
Yes, but that would more refer to, you could say, a discussion of planning approaches,

946
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:28,900
modernist planning for instance, where it was okay, we're going to organize the city in zones.

947
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:35,300
zones, here is residential function, here we have industrial function. But you're right,

948
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:43,620
and that's in the 40s city. It was at a larger scale managed like that. There was also

949
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:53,140
where a lot of urbanist counter-reaction was launched against later on. Think about figure of

950
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:59,780
Jane Jacobs, who basically said, well, with modernist planning this hand, there's a top-down

951
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:05,140
approach. It doesn't have anything to do with urban life in an obvious own. So we have to take

952
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:10,660
stock of that, just thinking about a different way of planning. So modernism would be a marker,

953
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:16,900
I would say, of, again, yeah, of urban society, but also about planning traditions that have

954
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:25,860
produced before the city. And then another way and this was really mentioned is

955
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:34,340
yeah the urban or the city is also kind of a projector of symbol at power. It sends a message

956
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:42,180
to the world and this is becoming I mean goes back to the 12th and the 13th century where

957
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:50,820
the legal cities and flowers had the highest, wanted to have the highest building or some

958
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:57,940
zoom in the other in the 14th century and northern Italy had something to do with corporate power,

959
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:04,820
the merchant power, and also showing the liberties of cities vis-a-vis territorial states,

960
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:10,580
which were then still feudal states and the Middle Ages. You see that this is becoming much more

961
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:16,740
globalized and that's the content of these messages is also very diverse. You have the CCTV

962
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:23,620
building on Beijing, which is some kind of a representation of, you can say, the authoritarian power

963
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:32,420
of the Chinese central state over China, but also, et cetera, totally, there's the World Trade Center.

964
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:37,140
Yeah, I don't think we need to deconstruct that.

965
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:42,740
And in there's a lot of images, I mean about a claim

966
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:47,540
imperialism by the US, which was vested in the commercial

967
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:52,660
interests or the commercial power of the US,

968
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:58,260
which then also became a symbol of oppression, if you will,

969
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:04,580
and made it a target for attacks as we all know.

970
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:12,140
So it's a highly contested or arbitrary symbol there.

971
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:17,700
And often it's also kind of used in spectacular developments,

972
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:23,820
you could say, Putska Lifa in the Middle East and Dubai.

973
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:28,220
It's kind of a part of a wider process of, say,

974
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:34,620
supply side economics where it's really about building capacity, building state-of-the-art

975
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:39,580
infrastructure, with the idea that it built a strong business, another bill in the end,

976
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:49,900
drive growth. Dubai, an emerald without oil, oil has run out since the 60s, has had this

977
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:55,500
diversification strategy, and it has been to some extent a kind of self-fitting prophecy.

978
01:14:56,380 --> 01:15:02,700
So yeah, it's kind of a token of importance of centrality that has been proclaimed there.

979
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:10,060
It also is a token of all the things, a huge exploitation of temporary labor, for instance,

980
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:15,820
but that is typically the dark side of these kind of buildings that is less discussed.

981
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:22,940
So, far the spectacular urbanism makes us wonder what is behind this image.

982
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:29,500
So yeah, symbolic power is also kind of projected by certain kind of cities.

983
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:36,940
And then maybe a final definition is in the atmosphere definition.

984
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:43,900
It has a certain jurisdiction within a country.

985
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:49,100
It's the way where all kinds of management processes are administered for the population,

986
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:53,100
a service, but it had a public sector organized itself.

987
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:59,100
What is kind of interesting is that there's a lot of historical

988
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:05,100
and yeah, aberrations almost when you take, for instance, the example

989
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:11,100
of Miesen and West Flanders. I put an arrow there, but there's a

990
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:15,100
Belgian that well. It has about 1,000 population,

991
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,100
In 2019, but it counts as a city.

992
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,100
So it's kind of a historical artifact.

993
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:28,100
It used to be a very important trading center for broad cloth,

994
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:36,100
if you've ever been to GrÃ¼ch, that was kind of the main kind of produce that was kind of traded there.

995
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:39,100
GrÃ¼ch is what's 40,000 a day at that time.

996
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:44,100
So a fifth of the size of world city, GrÃ¼ch is, I think the 13th century.

997
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:50,900
So what is a very small community now was there and then an important city and somehow

998
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:58,580
missing has kept city rights and would still count as a city in UN language.

999
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:06,980
Okay, so just to show that we should probably be very very about these classifications because

1000
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:10,180
they can be quite misleading.

1001
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:11,020
Okay.

1002
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:11,860
- Thank you.

1003
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:12,700
- Yeah.

1004
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:13,820
- One thing that's not like trying to get it out

1005
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:16,180
for the clinical care of the

1006
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,940
and the other, it's only the amount of the number

1007
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:20,340
of people living there or.

1008
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,180
- That's a good question.

1009
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,100
I don't know it by heart,

1010
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:27,180
but there would be a combination of many things

1011
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:30,300
that would be indeed size of the population.

1012
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:35,300
I think we have more morphological characteristics.

1013
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:42,300
typically it would be continuous built up areas.

1014
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:47,140
And then included in that,

1015
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:51,980
some definition of a percentage of people commuting

1016
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,300
to the poor city.

1017
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:57,620
So areas that are still dependent on the poor city

1018
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,820
because they're part of an integrated labor market.

1019
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:02,180
So I don't know it by heart,

1020
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,580
but there's kind of the agglomeration

1021
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,900
and then the bond here, which just gives a kind of an arbitrary

1022
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,340
of that.

1023
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:15,300
And that's basically what they call functional urban areas.

1024
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,380
That's the kind of definition that is

1025
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,980
practical, which gives you.

1026
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:23,220
The thing that you can also say is that you have to

1027
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,260
point--

1028
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,620
because I know what they need to tell what my

1029
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:28,340
friend is that there is a decision in

1030
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,820
everybody else who writes.

1031
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,180
So maybe they just never requested

1032
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,180
Anyway, it didn't.

1033
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:35,180
It did.

1034
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:35,180
It did.

1035
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:37,180
Well, back in the H.F.

1036
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,180
Yeah.

1037
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,180
Yeah.

1038
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,180
I think that that couldn't be--

1039
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,180
I don't know the ins and outs of that.

1040
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:46,180
But I think in Utah it could be part of the process as well.

1041
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,180
Yeah.

1042
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,180
[INAUDIBLE]

1043
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:52,180
We just look at our information.

1044
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:54,180
[INAUDIBLE]

1045
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:55,180
Yeah.

1046
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:57,780
They tried to come up with some kind of standardization

1047
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,500
on the criteria that I was mentioning.

1048
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:05,020
So how many people live there, more logical continuity,

1049
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:08,300
and then you could say economic relations.

1050
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,940
But especially with the population threshold,

1051
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,300
there's a huge dedication.

1052
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,700
Some countries would be 1,000, and others would be 10,000.

1053
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,140
It would be very good.

1054
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:26,260
I think they do because Belgium does.

1055
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:28,300
So that's kind of the irony.

1056
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:33,580
And that gets lost in when you look at the urbanization rates of 200 plus countries,

1057
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:40,140
you count the candidate. But the point by by Brennan instrument is that even if you solve that

1058
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:45,420
and come to a standardized definition, you're still not out of the woods because it could still

1059
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:52,860
create all kinds of chaotic conceptions because the burden is not the same as the city.

1060
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:56,700
Okay, so that was kind of what's the point, okay.

1061
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,900
So I hope, yeah, there's a number of perspectives here.

1062
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:05,500
There's not one size fits all answer to what you heard

1063
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,300
in the city is, but there's different ways

1064
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,020
of approaching the theme, okay.

1065
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:18,900
Now, one definition that we could still use,

1066
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,420
And this is also one that is used in the hamburger

1067
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:25,620
because it's kind of very generically at the abstract level.

1068
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,060
It's obviously urbanization is the process

1069
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:30,300
of becoming urban.

1070
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,300
And it refers at the abstract level

1071
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:36,660
to demographic process where it increasingly people live

1072
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,500
in more and more density.

1073
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,900
Has something to do with a globalization

1074
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:46,140
of urban influence,

1075
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:52,220
be an economic, political, cultural, it's kind of these places that matter.

1076
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:58,140
And obviously this frame of the urban age is mobilized there.

1077
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:08,220
And it's a call for starting to look into how cities are connected to the wider process of urban development.

1078
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:13,780
And this is also connecting back to this notion of planetary urbanization by

1079
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:22,780
and the sense what they argue is that while cities may not populate the entire hurt,

1080
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:32,780
they're actually quite delineated still. If you produce a map, you can't say that the entire global map is urban.

1081
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:40,780
Maybe a lot of people live in cities, but still it wouldn't be a totality. Whereas the urban,

1082
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:49,280
as a process, as a way of living, as a system of capitalist production, would be almost a totality.

1083
01:21:49,280 --> 01:22:00,780
And in planetary urbanization, characters actually de facto even when you go as far as possible from the urban context, from cities.

1084
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:04,280
It would still lead back to these cities one way or another.

1085
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:08,640
So the exploitation of sea beds in the North Atlantic,

1086
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,760
it's absolutely not--

1087
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,920
has not the characteristics of cities,

1088
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,320
but it's part of an exploitation process

1089
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:22,760
that are commanded through cities.

1090
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:27,760
So it's an example of what they call extensive urbanization,

1091
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,640
whereas intensive urbanization in their mind

1092
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,720
would be the morphology of cities.

1093
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:40,080
So it's a kind of sociological imaginary of urbanization as it all leads back to cities

1094
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:46,320
and one way or another. Whereas a more geographical imagination would start with, well, we can still

1095
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:53,360
illuminate certain places as being more dense, being more common than one another, whereas we also

1096
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:59,520
have to see the connections with other things. So that's just one more approach of looking at it.

1097
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,360
We've been talking a little bit about urbanism because it's always a bit of confusion,

1098
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,120
difference between urbanization, which we've been talking about, and urbanism.

1099
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:16,240
We have urbanists here. It's not just about observing an analyzing process,

1100
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:24,160
also designing cities and shaping cities in a particular way. So, urbanism is

1101
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:34,080
the MÃ©tis is the craft of actually designing cities to a certain end.

1102
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:39,600
But it also connects to, and that's perhaps also what you were talking about at some point,

1103
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,520
gaining an urban attitude as something of an energy of that particular society in cities.

1104
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:53,040
It refers to a particular psychological or sociological feeling that gives a particular meaning

1105
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:59,280
to the space. And I already talked about the opposition between the ideal type of a community

1106
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:06,000
where there's kind of warm social ties kicking things together versus society where it's more

1107
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:14,240
abstract, warmer roles that are in personal. I think when you look at cities and the representations

1108
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:20,960
and the way the urban space is consumed, you find a lot of that, you could say societal

1109
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:30,160
anonymity or that kind of detached element in those images. And when you look at,

1110
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:35,520
yeah, especially in the 19th century, I mean, when people started to capture

1111
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:41,520
personal modernity, urban modernity, and it was this idea of the figure of the floner,

1112
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:48,560
which was at the same time, it was usually the handy, a rich person that was both connected to

1113
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,120
cities because of his wealth and he had to show himself of it at the same time. It was also a

1114
01:24:53,120 --> 01:25:00,880
spectator, a walker by Passon who consumed urban space from an enormous and detached way.

1115
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:06,160
And especially in the 19th century, we have this gallery here close to the Grand Plus

1116
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:13,760
in Brussels, it was a kind of urban space was designed for this anonymous consumption,

1117
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,600
was all about collective spectacular consumption. And in many ways urban design,

1118
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:28,560
especially when we started rebrand our city centres, goes back to these forms of urban consumption.

1119
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:36,480
If you think about these renderings of a unspark bouffard, or if you look at renderings of how

1120
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,280
It will look like in 10 years.

1121
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:44,280
It has this kind of spectacular element always to it.

1122
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:53,280
That's that project, a particular kind of urban attitude that is there to consume urban space.

1123
01:25:53,280 --> 01:26:01,280
So urban design, it's about, you're really giving shape to urban spaces,

1124
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:06,080
also capturing how people interact with psychologically

1125
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,600
and social education, with the built environment,

1126
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,720
especially with urbanism,

1127
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,320
poor-ferences, environmental psychology,

1128
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,480
and that is a very important team.

1129
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:24,960
Planning is a future oriented activity,

1130
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,880
which actors are very types engaged

1131
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,760
so that they can govern how development will take place.

1132
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:35,920
So obviously, economic process, society process,

1133
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,440
don't just unfold in and of themselves.

1134
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,080
It's a kind of process that being mediated

1135
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:43,800
by particular planning cultures,

1136
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,640
being we talked about zoning before.

1137
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,400
It's about giving a place to certain activities,

1138
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,760
making choices of where things should be developed.

1139
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,000
And it's actually quite a power-laden process

1140
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,720
because development in one place

1141
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,600
could mean non-development in another place.

1142
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,680
Where do jobs, where are jobs being created?

1143
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,400
Where do they not?

1144
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,480
And how do certain planning procedures

1145
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:13,000
try to tackle a process of uneven development

1146
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,040
or under development in the city?

1147
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,360
And especially in a city like Brussels, one of the main,

1148
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,400
you could say, folk of urban planning

1149
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,640
in the regional plan has been the canal.

1150
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:33,760
was kind of a prioritization space which needed to be redeveloped in one way.

1151
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:41,280
It will be looking into the social geography of this place and throughout the course with

1152
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:46,640
also as we go on excursions. It's an ethnically diverse, the lower income

1153
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:52,240
neighbourhood with a lot of unemployment and it's also very much a zone of transition.

1154
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,200
There's a lot of things happening there.

1155
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,040
Redevelopment and planning is not neutral there.

1156
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,280
There has been a large focus on this area,

1157
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:05,280
both in terms of trying to achieve industrial redevelopment,

1158
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,280
because there was a lot of unemployment

1159
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:12,440
kind of a rollout of the zone of economic expansion

1160
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,800
that was installed there.

1161
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:18,240
That at the same time also the ambition to achieve

1162
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:25,240
to increase the mixing of residential and working.

1163
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:41,240
And what is kind of interesting there in Brussels is that there was a very big contradiction between the ambition to attract businesses to this area and create jobs and the ambition of

1164
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:47,800
of mixity because mixity worked as a kind of an incentive for all of residential developers

1165
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:59,000
to start building high end or regionally unaffordable apartments, house, etc.

1166
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:08,120
So the idea of let's mix stuff is actually making the return of jobs to this area

1167
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:12,840
very difficult at least to forms of industrial gentrification.

1168
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:20,760
And it's also leading to some kind of affordability crisis because the types of houses that are

1169
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:26,600
being produced there has nothing to do with what the local residents would actually need.

1170
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:32,760
Okay, so there's housing production but it's not tailored to the to the demand if you will.

Okay, I think, I think this is all, I would say, correct in a way,

1223
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,200
but it shows that there's different, different answers to this question.

1224
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:57,200
And the answer to this question has been different throughout the history of geography.

1225
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:06,200
I would say in the 19th century it was indeed about creating detailed information on these sources to geography

1226
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:13,200
and those kind of things because geography was installed in an imperial program of exploiting the colonies.

1227
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:21,200
But throughout the decades the main purpose or as a result of geography has shifted.

1228
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:28,200
Or there's different kind of parallel interpretations of what the purpose of geography should be.

1229
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:33,200
I started a number of definitions where else do we go?

1230
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:39,200
The real, real geographical society, this is kind of the heart of empire, if you will.

1231
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:45,200
One of the first geographical societies, it's kind of part of the British empire,

1232
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:52,680
as it's a kind of root disease and it gives us some idea of what geography could be.

1233
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:57,680
So it's the understanding of social and physical processes within the context.

1234
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:03,080
Place recognizing the great differences in culture, political system, economies, landscapes and environments

1235
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,960
because the world and exploring things between.

1236
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:12,960
So it's about the world as a mosaic, it's about geographical difference, sensitivity to contexts.

1237
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:21,900
And also thinking relationally, so how does something that happens in Brussels connects to

1238
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,140
quincias operands?

1239
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:25,800
So it's about connections between places.

1240
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,600
So these are not, I mean, I'm not saying these are ideal definitions.

1241
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:35,760
By far not, but we can be inspired and take certain things from.

1242
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:40,800
American association of geographers used to be the association of American members by the way,

1243
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:47,800
that they changed their name to reflect more diverse audience in the community.

1244
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:52,800
You want to understand the world, I'm not start with the river, city, mountain and

1245
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,800
village erode and follow it to the ends of the earth.

1246
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:02,520
Chography asks the big questions, where, how, why, what if, as you were saying, and gives

1247
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:06,600
you the perspective to answer them with advanced technology and the solid knowledge of

1248
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,200
the world in which we all live.

1249
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:12,640
So follow your nose, trace connections,

1250
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,400
and indeed ask these big questions.

1251
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:22,920
Perhaps in other disciplines, there's less space to do so.

1252
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,000
By the way, if you go to the original,

1253
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,360
you could say literal Greek transcription

1254
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:31,040
is heard description.

1255
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,160
But that doesn't tell you that much, right?

1256
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:40,840
standard definition would be to describe human activity at the interface of

1257
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:47,040
with the Earth or something like that. So somehow goes back to a very

1258
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:53,360
descriptive idea of what geography should be not necessarily producing any

1259
01:36:53,360 --> 01:37:00,440
analytical knowledge or explanatory knowledge. So I tend to not to like that

1260
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:08,080
definition too much but in original Greek it's what I mean. Now to further a little

1261
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:13,840
bit there and I think I mean this is going a little bit more towards my own

1262
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:19,160
interpretation as well just another quote. Take from the handbook while most

1263
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:23,760
social science disciplines can be roughly defined by what they study the

1264
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,800
economy culture society and so on. Geography is defined by how is that so that

1265
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:32,920
was you were saying and then so the world by our approach. Geographers studied the

1266
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:38,040
economy's set of politics and culture too but a geographical perspective is one that emphasizes

1267
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:46,520
space and is supposed to any of these things. So it's not just that we can claim like political

1268
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:53,880
scientists or like economists this kind of thematic field. It's really our you could say theoretical

1269
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:58,760
and analytical working with the notion of space,

1270
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:03,680
space as something that explains what human activity

1271
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:10,360
as it interacts with its environment that really identifies.

1272
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:13,520
So sets us apart asographers from us.

1273
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,000
Yeah.

1274
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,200
Just to question the power system,

1275
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,600
the condition and any difference from,

1276
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,640
no, as you jump sociology as well.

1277
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:26,640
because there would be far less attention to space, I would say.

1278
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:32,640
So, Charles, the only isn't that space is also the final of human interactions.

1279
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:36,640
Like, the old one is showing.

1280
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:40,640
How space defines, how I wouldn't think so.

1281
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:46,640
I think sociologists would start with a particular history,

1282
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:54,480
histories perhaps, look at the relations, organizational forms, perhaps identity, those kind of processes

1283
01:38:54,480 --> 01:39:02,000
that I think, and they perhaps they may describe the variety across different contexts in one way

1284
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:10,880
or another, but perhaps they would not use geography to explain those differences. So, for instance,

1285
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,400
I mean, what could I think of as an example?

1286
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:20,040
I mean, when you try to understand urban life,

1287
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:23,840
being sensitive to how you're inserted

1288
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:30,280
in the global network of cities could be one way

1289
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:32,040
to appreciate your own positionality.

1290
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:35,320
So if you're a citizen of a city like in Shasta,

1291
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,760
which is an exploitative or subordinate relation

1292
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,600
to other cities in the world,

1293
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:46,560
Let me give you a hint of why your living conditions are that bad, whereas sociologist

1294
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:53,680
may perhaps start explaining that from local cultures, local society characteristics,

1295
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,440
political system, etc.

1296
01:39:55,440 --> 01:40:00,240
The geographer would, for instance, try to put that in perspective, say, look, there's

1297
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:06,880
a no-for-racking system, a world system of sorts, and maybe we can talk about this next

1298
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,880
week that allows to explain that a little bit better.

1299
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:23,880
Okay, but I think, yeah, and that connects a little bit to the next thing and the sociological imagination.

1300
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:30,880
And these are the words, I mean, this is what they've created, Harvey writes and social justice in the city.

1301
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:38,880
It enables the possess it when it stands the larger historical scene in terms of its meaning for in-a-life and external career of writing of individuals.

1302
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:44,880
For the sociological imagination enables us to grasp history and biography and relation between the two in society.

1303
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:49,880
So it's about think about issues like class and how knowledge is produced.

1304
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:55,960
what kind of questions that you ask that are predefined or not predefined by

1305
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:02,120
shaped by your own class identity differences or identity. To acknowledge that

1306
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:06,400
would be one thing. But Harvey says the spatial imagination enables the

1307
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:11,360
individual to recognize the role of space and place and so on biography. So take

1308
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:21,280
for instance somebody from South Africa who starts teaching in London as a

1309
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:28,000
geographer, how with this personal trajectory lead to some kind of a focus on

1310
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
issues of what is modernity, what is non-modernity, what is development, what is

1311
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,560
under development and those kinds of things. So how brings us a career as a

1312
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,440
to the global south, going to the global north,

1313
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:44,680
might shape the questions that are being asked.

1314
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:47,080
Next to just issues of class at Missity

1315
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:51,120
and other elements that may shape positionality.

1316
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:54,120
I could use the example of Jennifer Robinson, for instance,

1317
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,520
from the fitness exercise.

1318
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,680
And she came up with the idea of ordinary cities,

1319
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,480
somehow debunking the whole idea

1320
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,280
that would be extraordinary world cities,

1321
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,840
and then the rest, OK?

1322
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:10,280
So just saying that in your personal biographies,

1323
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:13,320
your spatial trajectory and your spatial relations

1324
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:16,520
with other places may also have an impact

1325
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:20,160
on the kind of questions that you're asking.

1326
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,720
I'm not saying that sociologists are blind,

1327
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:27,000
but they just ask different kind of questions.

1328
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,240
Okay.

1329
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:31,400
Now for me, I mean, these are difficult theoretical discussions

1330
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,480
and it's also not a epistemological, epistemology class,

1331
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:42,120
But I think it's safe to say that as human geographers were interested in the interactions

1332
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:49,080
between space and society, how spaces, shape societies and individuals and vice versa,

1333
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:53,720
how individuals and societies shaped their environments.

1334
01:42:53,720 --> 01:43:01,160
And this is kind of what, at so jump, a famous American job for a call, the social

1335
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:09,640
spatial dialectic. And then you translate that to cities. It's how urban societies make

1336
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:16,360
the places they live in. And at the same time, how urban space morphologically or otherwise

1337
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:21,880
has, again, back an influence on urban life as groups and individuals. Think about

1338
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:28,760
segregation, which shows a segregated social structure. It's something social, but also

1339
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:33,760
So will the fine kind of interactions that you have with others in driven space.

1340
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,560
And they have an impact on what kind of encounters you have in the city.

1341
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:46,000
They have an impact on how privileged you are to what extent you know other social groups

1342
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,160
and societies, etc.

1343
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:52,640
So space, one example that you're going to the work of Nikhil later on, that shows that

1344
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:59,240
space has in itself some kind of autonomous form of explanation. I'm very

1345
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:05,400
the friends as a job for as you can see because as all geographers I have an

1346
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:10,640
identity crisis but that's kind of a very productive one I would say because

1347
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:16,040
this kind of typifies the history of post-war history of geography. Maybe

1348
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:21,880
other geographers will recognize that. Yeah so the social spatial dialectic

1349
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:27,080
perhaps as a synthesis what we can land on our society's people,

1350
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:33,880
make spaces and how it works back to them. And thinking about the autonomous power of space

1351
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:45,240
and explaining stuff. As an example, if I can, can I? Yes. Four ways, I mean you mentioned already,

1352
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:49,640
it's thinking about different concepts of space, territory, scale, network,

1353
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:57,480
place or common ways of thinking about space. And we point to different kind of spatial processes.

1354
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:03,480
And again, it's not that one is better than the other to understand what is happening.

1355
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:10,520
But as I will try to show by the example of Brussels, it's kind of seeking tension between these

1356
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:16,760
different concepts that gets us a little bit closer to understanding, for instance, in this case,

1357
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:25,000
the conundrum that Brussels poses. So one way of looking at the city of Brussels is a territorial

1358
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:31,000
one. It has a particular jurisdiction. It's the Brussels capital region which emerged as a region

1359
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:38,920
somewhere in the 1990s, next to Flanger's Hamelonia, and it has so competences, it has a government

1360
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:45,720
argument. We can do stuff, the side stuff on the territory, but not on the culture because that's

1361
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:51,920
something that is being decided by Columbus and the Francophone community.

1362
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:58,220
But other than that, there's kind of sovereignty on that level as what can be decided.

1363
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:01,220
So it's a very strict kind of bounded space.

1364
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:06,020
If you walk 10 meters outside those boundaries in principle,

1365
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:09,120
the Brussels government can't say anything about you.

1366
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:14,920
And on the other hand, it also can erect all kinds of barriers,

1367
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:19,720
as long as one wants to add another lane to the ring road across Brussels,

1368
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:23,720
because it has very centered on car mobility.

1369
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:29,720
Well, there's a waste of blocking that, because there are certain stretches of the ring road,

1370
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:32,920
when Brussels can say, "No, let's not do that here."

1371
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,320
And then the end-to-end up still with the bottlenecks.

1372
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:49,320
Okay, so this is territorial power to some extent, which has also been used by the Brussels government saying everything is 50 kilometers an hour max when you entered our territory.

1373
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:57,320
So yeah, take it or leave it. So with territorial view, what Brussels could be?

1374
01:46:57,320 --> 01:47:02,120
One would be more scalar view and scale.

1375
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:04,560
Yeah, you could say it's a spatial scale.

1376
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,800
It's kind of a sensitivity to different processes

1377
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,240
work on different scales.

1378
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:12,080
Some of them are really micro teaching

1379
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:16,680
is a micro process taking place in the scale here

1380
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,760
of the classroom.

1381
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,360
Whereas you could say, commuting is something that's

1382
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:25,000
big place at the far larger scale.

1383
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:31,760
as we go home, it's a process that radically goes beyond the boundaries of this class.

1384
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,960
It's the same when you look at economic activities.

1385
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:40,160
If you look at the metropolitan area more logically,

1386
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:45,480
Brussels is actually much larger than the Brussels capital feature.

1387
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:52,440
So if you were to define Brussels as a scale of where urban activities take place,

1388
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:57,240
you could end up halfway to flongers or halfway to Bologna.

1389
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:02,760
So it radically deborders the territory that is the Brussels capital region.

1390
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:11,960
In contrast to other contexts, there has not been a very successful process of, you could say,

1391
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:20,040
city regionalization, where there was some kind of governance expansion to manage the

1392
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,960
the metropolitan process.

1393
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:25,480
And a lot of context to see that new governance structures

1394
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:29,200
have been erected, think about London, for instance,

1395
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:33,280
it hugely exceeds the original heartland of London,

1396
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,680
but includes more and more of its peripheries,

1397
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:41,240
because these places are connected to the urban area.

1398
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,000
This is not what happened in Brussels,

1399
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,880
and this has something to do with the fact

1400
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:50,680
that is a very commonitarian sense definition,

1401
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:53,140
because it deals with all kinds of issues

1402
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:57,080
of redistribution of income, et cetera.

1403
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:00,560
We have to keep in mind that about 60% of Belgian GDP

1404
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:05,320
is generated in Brussels, but it's not being governed

1405
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:08,960
into its totality by the Brussels government.

1406
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,480
In fact, and that brings us to the third one,

1407
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:13,880
it's a matter of perspective.

1408
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:16,040
There's all kinds of micro networks,

1409
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:19,080
and in this case, this is the commuting map of Belgium,

1410
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,000
that makes that the surplus that has been generated

1411
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,520
by all these activities and Brussels,

1412
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,280
I think about head order functions,

1413
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:28,600
you're being functioned that apparently

1414
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:31,320
accounts for a quarter of the Brussels economy,

1415
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:34,080
it actually leaks to the periphery.

1416
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,880
So it leaks beyond the borders of the territory

1417
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,000
of the Brussels capital region,

1418
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,800
a lot of people including myself,

1419
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:50,120
work in Brussels, but basically paid taxes outside of Brussels.

1420
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:56,440
So I didn't get this beautiful old city in Belgium.

1421
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:59,920
And I get taxed in flounders.

1422
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,560
I spent a lot of money well, not so much,

1423
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,760
because I worked too much.

1424
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:07,640
I could spend a lot of money in Ghent.

1425
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:10,600
But it basically is some kind of fiscal leakage

1426
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:13,680
from territory, right?

1427
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:17,320
And this is a problem of Brussels.

1428
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:22,320
We also could talk about Europe, rats, who are not texts at all,

1429
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:23,320
but work in Brussels.

1430
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:27,200
So we can wonder about the multiplier, economic multiplier

1431
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:30,200
that's being created by all these activities in Brussels.

1432
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:33,200
And that means that, yeah, there's a lot of large visiting

1433
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:38,840
class, about 400,000 commuters come to Brussels every day.

1434
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:42,520
Well, pre-corona, let's see if it's still the case.

1435
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:46,880
But the use of city dispense time on the infrastructure,

1436
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,440
but not necessarily paying for that.

1437
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:53,160
And I'll spare you details of other kinds of ways

1438
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:56,680
of raging deaths as solidarity then between the regions

1439
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:01,320
of Flounders, for instance, space a number of billions

1440
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,760
every year to Brussels as a sign of solidarity,

1441
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:07,560
where you can also frame it as just bamed bill

1442
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:11,560
for being on the metro and Brussels, using it every day.

1443
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:15,560
So there's kind of a discussion there.

1444
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:18,720
And it also is framed in very, at a terrible,

1445
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:22,360
humanitarian terms.

1446
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:27,280
And this is kind of when you use a concept like place,

1447
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,360
it gets you a bit closer to these processes,

1448
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:31,720
how people attach meanings to this place.

1449
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:35,000
So Brussels and how it's represented in Belgium media

1450
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:43,120
or Flemming's media, I invite you to buy a Flemming newspaper and run it to Google

1451
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:50,120
to see how Brussels is being represented, is particular frame, which has been augmented

1452
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:59,400
or essentialized even further as we had the terrorist attacks in 2016, where even Mr.

1453
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:04,400
former president Trump described normally as a health hole.

1454
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:10,080
I was very nicely taken over by a Chinese media because it kind of resonates with the idea of

1455
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:21,400
yeah, unsafe image of Brussels, dirty image of Brussels.

1456
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:24,240
And yeah, so it kind of resonates there.

1457
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:31,720
what you see is especially is that this also, say, reenacted in the entire COVID crisis, we're

1458
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:38,480
again, it's the same frame of yeah, Brussels got managed, look at vaccination rates, it doesn't get

1459
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:45,480
it for the relationship control, they're messing up again. If we were independent and flowers, yeah,

1460
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:51,960
that we could be of all kinds of other COVID regulations, etc. That would be free already. So it's kind

1461
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:58,840
of this frame of attaching certain meanings to certain places there's big. So if you just go to

1462
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:07,320
Lidakaka, or you could also take Delbeak, it's a big sign, who are flarming in Thursday. And so it's

1463
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:19,080
Lidakaka, it's somewhere here. So it's really in balance on Brussels in terms of commuting.

1464
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:26,600
But what you see is that with the kind of return of higher and residential functions to city

1465
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:32,600
to city of Brussels, that there's actually a lot of displacement going on and a lot of people

1466
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:38,440
that used to live in what they call the residual housing market still affordable housing in Brussels,

1467
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:45,320
it's actually being pushed out and it's increasingly computing to Brussels from further

1468
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:51,920
further away. So in a sense you can say Brussels is spilling over all the way to

1469
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:56,120
Lidicakka. What you see is that there is a very strong opposition by

1470
01:53:56,120 --> 01:54:02,760
either deterring parties, a local mayor, which is really trying to form a

1471
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:08,120
kind of bridge, if you will towards all that is foreign in this case Brussels.

1472
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:17,360
Okay, so, Lydicarica is placed in opposition to this process of urbanization there.

1473
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:22,920
We can think about it what we want when it's certainly something that is explaining a lot

1474
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:29,280
of the tensions between Brussels and its growing intellect.

1475
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:37,940
So for takes of Brussels to a four different kind of spatial approaches and I think

1476
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:46,560
combining them tells us a bit more about what on earth Brussels as a city is.

1477
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:50,520
Okay, is there still time?

1478
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:55,040
You still have time for one minute of thinking about what being critical means?

1479
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:58,040
I think eight minutes we can stop.

1480
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:02,560
So one minute of thinking of what is critical,

1481
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,800
not in a sense your condition is critical,

1482
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,760
but what is critical urban studies

1483
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,240
or critical urban geography for you.

1484
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,640

I think it's about the critical about what effect is.

1543
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:16,560
Personally, I would say, it says how to have a fact as produced

1544
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,640
to use Bruno La Proul.

1545
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:23,280
In the sense that if you put men in white jackets,

1546
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,640
it would give certain people the more power

1547

to actually produce a fact.

Whereas, for voices, marginal voices

1549
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:31,080
would not be in that position.

1550
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,120
Yeah?

1551
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:37,000
It seems like, I could feel level and involve, like,

1552
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,360
keep your life the implications of the way

1553
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:42,160
you're conceptualizing things are in terms of economic

1554
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:46,760
and social, in terms of that, and re-evaluating

1555
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,160
the theory of their framework.

1556

1575
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:25,200
Something that matters one way or another, but be reflexive about the fact that

1576
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:31,360
some things might really matter and be picked up, but not necessarily be, you could say, very progressive.

1577
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:38,360
I mean, in a fascist society, there's all kinds of knowledge on segregation to be produced

1578
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:43,720
that is very useful, and you could be extremely politically engaged in that, but not necessarily

1579
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:48,840
thinking about, you could say, marginalized forces there.

1580
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:54,760
Third point indeed, taking seriously the experiences, life, practice, and words of ordinary

1581
02:01:54,760 --> 02:02:00,200
urban residents or marginalized social groups to think about, really, okay, we have this

1582
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:05,440
hegemonic representation, what would happen if you would ask different people with

1583
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:10,280
wisdom in a different positionality, etc., etc. Obviously you have your

1584
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:15,680
positionality as a researcher in yourself and maybe sometimes very hard

1585
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:22,280
for instance as a man to study from his perspectives. He may also be not

1586
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:29,240
recognized as being a rightful person to study in these kind of aspects. So I

1587
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:37,480
I think it's a kind of a negotiation process there and then again, or think about women

1588
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:45,400
that focus on the liteness of investment banking in the city, think about work within the

1589
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:51,960
McDowell for instance, and how it's a difficult process for women to actually enter these

1590
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:57,480
spaces, have access. But once they get access, they ask very different questions that

1591
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:02,480
actually leading quite revolutionary concerns.

1592
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:06,480
And now to another formulation, and that's why I was a little bit hesitant with

1593
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:14,680
there are no facts. I don't agree. I think there are facts, in a sense that there are factual

1594
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:23,380
realities. And you see this kind of kind of middle ground between you could say, shoot

1595
02:03:23,380 --> 02:03:28,980
as being something that's being constructed, but you always have to construct it on the basis

1596
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:37,860
of some kind of empirical factual reality. So not radical deconstruction or post-structuralist thinking.

1597
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:44,660
There's always a way of saying this is, I don't know the entire truth, but this is probably

1598
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:51,460
a little bit more true than something else. And yeah, you can write the citation, a re-decitation

1599
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:55,060
Sorry, what he says is that the ultimate goal

1600
02:03:55,060 --> 02:04:00,860
is to reduce illusion in society and of itself.

1601
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:05,180
So if you have sharp needs, they not go.

1602
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:07,540
And with the vocabulary in concepts,

1603
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,580
you can work with that.

1604
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:11,140
And you will see things perhaps in a different life

1605
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:17,420
and take away false beliefs and illusions in society.

1606
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:21,420
And it also means that it's a kind of a placeless

1607
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:25,480
and timeless definition is sense that this could be the mission, for instance, of critical

1608
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:31,040
urban studies or critical urban geography. And what is critical and what is a false belief

1609
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:35,760
and what is an illusion may change over time. But it's kind of, it keeps holding as a

1610
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:45,080
finishing, but it may have to be updated in terms of habits. So some rules of thumb, there's

1611
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:51,920
There's no universal theory of anything, and I think we'll show that.

1612
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:58,400
We have to be sensitive to the fact that every theory has its birthmarks.

1613
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:04,760
What were the questions that really gave rise to formulating a research question to a theory

1614
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,240
in a particular way?

1615
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:12,720
Well, we'll have to take a look at the context of historical and station to understand

1616
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:13,880
what that was.

1617
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:19,920
So think about the Chicago School that you'll be talking about with Nick.

1618
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,360
It was assumed to be universal model.

1619
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:29,840
There's actually a model of a city that captures rapid urbanization in the early 20th century

1620
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,520
and northern Europe.

1621
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,880
And then the question to what extent it actually explains something in different locations

1622
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,600
and different times.

1623
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:40,460
We're not going to reject that, but we have to mobilize that concept and see how far

1624
02:05:40,460 --> 02:05:41,460
we get.

1625
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:44,740
So we have to be reflexive about these bird marks.

1626
02:05:44,740 --> 02:05:50,180
So, even the concept of class is something that is a western inception, if you will.

1627
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:54,660
To an extent, does it allow to actually capture, for instance, Indian society?

1628
02:05:54,660 --> 02:06:01,540
So we need to kind of provincialize theory and say, okay, it originated at some point.

1629
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:05,780
And now we can meaningfully think about how we can speak of course context.

1630
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:11,940
So think about a global city as a concept that emerged,

1631
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:14,540
say mostly in Northern America, Western Europe,

1632
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:16,740
what extent does it allow to capture what is going on

1633
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:18,660
in Singapore for instance?

1634
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:23,540
So to play while being reflexive about these concepts

1635
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:25,900
with the application across the country.

1636
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:28,580
And engaged pluralism, that's kind of, I mean,

1637
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:30,100
might be for engaged pluralism.

1638
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:32,540
It means that there are different kind of theoretical stances,

1639
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:34,740
different kind of question being passed,

1640
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:37,100
entering from different kind of teams.

1641
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:42,020
And I think it's not just about acknowledging that,

1642
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:44,180
but it's actually engaging with this kind of

1643
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:48,100
dissenting opinions and trying to look for a conversation.

1644
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,980
And maybe we can talk a little bit more about that

1645
02:06:50,980 --> 02:06:53,580
next week or in the next sessions.

1646
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:58,300
As Purbin studies has drawn and become ever more global,

1647
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:01,140
as the urbanization has also globalized,

1648
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:09,940
There's always a risk that has some work that will become lost and in comparison to use the words of Jamie back.

1649
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:18,700
That we lose our points of reference to actually be able to have some kind of coherent urban studies project or at least speak to one another.

1650
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:24,380
So I think there's a danger with a global research agenda with so many contextual differences.

1651
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:27,540
How do we still make sense of urban processes

1652
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:31,100
when Singapore versus Brussels?

1653
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:33,300
How do you put them there?

1654
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:36,140
Now, I want to bore you now to that with the next two slides

1655
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:41,340
too much, but I just want to say that what geography was

1656
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:43,020
and what kind of critical questions

1657
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:48,300
were asked has changed tremendously throughout time.

02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:51,420
Much of geography originally was really

1659
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:56,300
about human interaction with the environment,

1660
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:59,880
say environmental determinism where it was really

1661
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:02,340
believed, yes, it's really the physical environment

1662
02:08:02,340 --> 02:08:05,380
that would shape human activities.

1663
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:07,820
Regional geography was also a very big tradition,

1664
02:08:07,820 --> 02:08:10,460
especially before the Second World War,

1665
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:12,540
where it was really about the description

1666
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:15,900
of human activities in their physical region.

1667
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:17,100
There's still some tradition there.

1668
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:20,220
But what really happened after the Second World War,

1669
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:22,420
Most were any, especially since the 70s,

1670
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:24,280
it was a period of, let's say,

1671
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:27,660
a social and political economic upheaval

1672
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:32,360
is a huge branching out of geography.

1673
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:36,100
So there's quite a plurality of traditions there.

1674
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:40,780
And they take us quite far from the origins of geography,

1675
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:44,060
which was really about settlements, if you will,

1676
02:08:44,060 --> 02:08:48,980
and the pre-World War era was about, okay,

1677
02:08:48,980 --> 02:08:51,940
show East India and where are the settlements

1678
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:55,540
or describe me the structure of a city.

1679
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:58,900
Of the second world war, especially in the United States,

1680
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:01,140
it was a kind of a nomotetic move.

1681
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:03,300
And we have to formalize this.

1682
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:05,380
And you have for instance, Walter Castella

1683
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:09,660
who came with quite a neat model to explain

1684
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:12,820
why at certain locations you had certain settlements

1685
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:14,620
over certain sides.

1686
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:17,900
Or for instance, the O's and what's going on,

1687
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:19,620
start formalizing the idea.

1688
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:22,780
OK, if there's certain activities within the city

1689
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:26,180
at a certain space, it must have something to do with the kind

1690
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:29,900
of value that is being generated by those activities.

1691
02:09:29,900 --> 02:09:32,060
And the fact that some activities out

1692
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:34,220
with others on a certain location.

1693
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:36,620
So these are kind of foundational approaches.

1694
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:37,860
And I'm going very fast here.

1695
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:41,860
I know, but it's just to take note of that,

1696
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:48,660
This led to much more plural discussion as of the '70s.

1697
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:52,060
And I can't really do justice to hold these different traditions

1698
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:52,860
here.

1699
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:56,500
But what you could say, more radical and critical voices

1700
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:58,700
share in one tradition, you could say,

1701
02:09:58,700 --> 02:10:04,020
yes, questions of social justice, distribution.

1702
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:08,340
They work in a materialist setting for what people have

1703
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:10,300
and how this class, for instance, income,

1704
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:16,380
It's a track pass, how does that explain the visions in the city?

1705
02:10:16,380 --> 02:10:20,060
Nice names, such as David Harvey, Neil Smith,

1706
02:10:20,060 --> 02:10:22,260
and I think the fair that those were kind of

1707
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:24,260
periods with a lot of social change,

1708
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:29,100
where social mobility of the working class in 1970s.

1709
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:33,980
Feminine's geographies that also emerged at this point,

1710
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:39,140
questioning male dominated views on society, et cetera.

1711
02:10:39,140 --> 02:10:42,260
So thinking about placing geography,

1712
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:46,340
relating it to the process of capitalism.

1713
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:50,420
The other big strands you could say,

1714
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:56,020
is more you could say a humanistic geography

1715
02:10:56,020 --> 02:11:00,180
that thinks about urban lifestyles, urban behaviors,

1716
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:04,940
urban cultures, which less kind of relates itself

1717
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:08,860
to capitalism in a sense.

1718
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:11,860
but really starts with, okay, what kind of forces

1719
02:11:11,860 --> 02:11:13,820
haven't we heard in the city?

1720
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:16,260
How are cities being experienced?

1721
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:18,980
Can we think about the power of representation?

1722
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:21,100
How different spaces are being represented?

1723
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:23,380
What the power of discourse is?

1724
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:25,460
It's not just about material circumstances,

1725
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:27,620
it's also how we think about certain places

1726
02:11:27,620 --> 02:11:30,460
that will explain what they've explained.

1727
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:32,220
And also, we shift towards more important things,

1728
02:11:32,220 --> 02:11:34,460
all of the different methods

1729
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:39,460
that kind of specifies the cultural term more widely.

1730
02:11:39,460 --> 02:11:41,660
And this is not the end of a conversation,

1731
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:43,740
I would say, and that's kind of your buttons

1732
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:46,740
of purpose of this more widely

1733
02:11:46,740 --> 02:11:48,500
and urban journey, particularly,

1734
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:51,700
that all these different approaches exist next to one another.

1735
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:54,340
But you have to kind of be aware

1736
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:56,460
that they work in different kinds of traditions

1737
02:11:56,460 --> 02:12:00,100
and then formulate questions in a particular way.

1738
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:03,060
And I think you will see returning here and there

1739
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:05,380
throughout the course, somebody who works,

1740
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:07,180
perhaps a little bit more in that framework,

1741
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:09,180
was thought to refer to that tradition,

1742
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:10,740
and it's something to be aware of.

1743
02:12:10,740 --> 02:12:12,780
I can't adjust this to the history of geography

1744
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:16,780
in three slides, that would be over the top,

1745
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:18,820
but it's something to think about.

1746
02:12:18,820 --> 02:12:21,020
Okay, I'll end there.

1747
02:12:21,020 --> 02:12:23,180
Sorry, it's for taking a little bit longer.

1748
02:12:23,180 --> 02:12:26,060
By next week, please try to get over

1749
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:29,700
over these two texts, or share it with your colleagues,

1750
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:34,700
And the world city hypothesis by John Friedman and Paul B.

1751
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:38,740
And somewhat less old, but still already bit later.

Not to be quite a mixed bit of muscles.

1755
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:51,460
All right.

1756
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:52,980
Thank you very much.

1757
02:12:52,980 --> 02:12:56,020

# 2 Theories of world-city formation

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,760
[ Music ]

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,160
>> Welcome everybody and evening.

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,340
Welcome to the second session.

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:39,620
of urban social geography. Thanks for being here despite the live stream and the

5
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,900
recording. I think it really makes sense to be here so we can have a bit of an

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:54,580
interactive session. How did you arrive in Brussels first week? Everything going

7
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,580
Okay, yeah.

8
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,900
Yeah, okay.

9
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,500
Your landing still a little bit.

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,900
How did you find a stonselow for those attending?

11
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,780
Did someone attend?

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,420
Stonselows, yeah.

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,980
Then I'll live up to your expectations more or less.

14
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,380
And you find it weird and they started with over 50%

15
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,700
of the urban population lifts and cities.

16
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,580
That was on the first slide.

17
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,100
OK.

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,220
We didn't have a deal that she would put that on there.

19
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,340
But I can see her critical minds.

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,780
You can start thinking about first slides so that we have

21
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,780
her answers here.

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,020
Ready?

23
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,020
OK.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,100
Today we'll be talking about--

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:57,100
I could say an important chunk of research into urban geography.

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Most of my geographers, yes.

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:09,100
I haven't. No, last week that. Yeah, it didn't work.

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,100
Yeah, you remember? Yes.

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,100
Okay. That's what, no, this system doesn't work.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,100
I'm not sure why.

31
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,100
have a singing voice, so I'll try to project my ideas.

32
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,900
And if you don't hear it, I can give it a bit higher or louder.

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,540
But maybe we should be a little bit quiet

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,740
and then that will help as well.

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,900
So, rural cities, global cities,

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,300
one of the big debates I think in urban geography

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,860
and urban cities more widely.

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,820
It's also a very long standing debate going back

39
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,940
at least the eighties, which probably also explains what you had to read all

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:55,540
stuff that you may or may not find outdated. I hope it's not outdated. They're

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,980
all text but I think it's still relevant in one way or another and we'll also

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,380
try to discuss that a little bit. Now what's the structure of today? There's

43
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:13,660
three main parts of this lecture. First of all, we're going to discuss, I mean very generally,

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,900
the centrality of cities and city regions in the global economy and we'll take you through

45
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,220
three complementary views, I've used that built on one another by Joe Friedman, Sosca,

46
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,780
Sosca, and Alan Scott. Secondly, so that's kind of a conceptual theoretical discussion.

47
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:36,220
Secondly, we'll have more of a methodological discussion, which deals with how given these

48
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,840
concepts how we can actually measure and say something empirical about world cities and

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,580
global cities.

50
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:49,540
And one of the main methodologies there is the methodology by GOG, which is the globalization

51
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,700
and world cities research network, which was founded somewhere in the 1990s by Peter Taylor.

52
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,020
has been one of the main, you could say, empirical methodological contributions to the

53
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,620
debate from that period.

54
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:13,460
And third of all, as we'll learn, there was some kind of a dominance by Gorg, if you will,

55
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,260
in this area of cities in globalization.

56
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:24,940
And there is a dominant voice, there is also quite a bit of friendly and unfriendly critique

57
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:33,660
criticism toward this particular framing of global safety and world safety formation.

58
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:41,660
And I think going into these debates is actually quite telling as to how we define global

59
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,380
cities where we think that that criticism is justified, whereas perhaps less justified,

60
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,300
very beautiful with other kind of issues. And I'll be talking about four of those

61
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,980
points of criticism. One you could call the post-colonial critique, a social

62
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,660
constructivist critique, people that talk about state riskailing on the role of

63
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,900
the state and then finally some brilliant minds that had something to say

64
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,220
about financialization, okay, and that may alter our reading of what actually

65
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:23,420
happens in global cities. But before we start, my question to you, why are cities central

66
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:29,140
in the global economy and what would it mean to say that cities are actually powerful,

67
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:36,820
economically powerful? Take a minute, talk to your neighbor right-time few notes and think

68
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:45,780
about what your own should-could be. Go ahead.

69
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,780
(audience laughing)

70
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,780

136

then and perhaps also think that political terms, some world cities or world city regions or

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:23,460
global city regions are. This is a list and this is research by a certain man named Alombrecht

138
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:30,180
from the early North East. Nick compared the main, you could say leading metropolitan areas in

139
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,260
in Western Europe. So it's by no means an international comparison at the global scale.

140
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:43,940

146

Okay? So comparing these five areas on a number of characteristics and you also see

147
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,740
the next figures, what he kind of finds is that these region city regions, much of

148
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,820
often areas are punching above their weight.

149
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,820
If you compare the share in a national surface,

150
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,860
so the size in terms of built up structure,

151
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,980
then the complete territory is actually quite small.

152
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,420
And you compare that to figures in population,

153
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,340
this largely outweigh the share in national territory.

154
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,860
And then when you look at the share of these areas in GDP,

155
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,660
which is kind of the value,

156
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,020
total value of all economic transactions,

157
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,380
which is a full measure in many ways,

158
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,380
but it's one way of starting to compare national economies.

159
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,660
We see that these areas actually

160
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,580
point about their rates.

161
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,980
So for instance, when you look at the Flemish diamond,

162
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,900
to take the Belgian example, 30% of national service,

163
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,580
52% of the population lives there,

164
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,620
but 63% of all economic activities actually

165
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,020
they place there.

166
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,220
More striking figures are even there for Paris.

167
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,780
London only 1% of the territory about, we

168
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,620
could say, 1/10 to 1/5 of the population,

169
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,900
but in terms of economic power,

170
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,820
especially in the case of Paris, it's way bigger than you

171
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,780
would in this.

172
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,380
So on large agglomeration and concentration,

173
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,540
of you could say economic transactions

174
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,180
that is taking place.

175
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,560
It also means that a lot of these places

176
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,780
tend to be richer than their hinterlands.

177
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,020
So it's kind of a runaway process at something

178
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,500
when these activities that are taking place there,

179
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,580
that generates more wealth per capita.

180
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,660
So this is GDP per head.

181
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,060
So it divides the value of economic activities

182
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,540
by the total population in that city.

183
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,700
So typically these places are richer than your pain

184
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,500
average and also compared to the rest of the encounter.

185
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,940
In that sense, when you look at Brussels,

186
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,220
Brussels is, you could say, the richest city in Belgium.

187
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,620
In principle, richer than the rest of Belgium.

188
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,340
But as we discussed last week, there's

189
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,220
a lot of this well actually in leaking to the periphery,

190
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,620
which is actually in flawless and mononia.

191
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,700
So it doesn't really show when you look at

192
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,820
at figures from the press of capital region,

193
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,380
but the same would actually apply.

194
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,460
Another way of looking at it is that,

195
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,260
and this was kind of referred to by

196
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,460
the concentration also of ideas innovation people.

197
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,940
It's very difficult to measure that.

198
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,500
One way of doing it is looking at patents, right?

199
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,780
Which is a kind of certification,

200
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,780
legal certification that something has been invented in one area or another,

201
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,780
a COVID vaccine, some kind of a chick, an algorithm, whatever.

202
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,780
And it has intellectual property on it.

203
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,780
So, and it can be commercialized in one way or not.

204
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,780
But it's a very, you could say, post hoc, exposed kind of measurement of places.

205
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,780
And there, there, there, a measure of innovation.

206
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,780
But it's a way to compare different areas.

207
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:43,120
What you see is that here it's a bit more mixed, a few, for instance, in France, you

208
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,500
see that Paris is actually outperforming the rest of the country.

209
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,860
This is far less the case in the UK, but it is the case in France's "The Flammish

210
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
Dark."

211
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,860
It's a bit more of a bit mixed picture, but we see that in general there's a tendency

212
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,400
to locate, you could say, innovative processes

213
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,700
as evidence to battles.

214
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,300
There's a lot of innovation that is not being measured here,

215
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,860
no social innovation, for instance.

216
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,280
It's really linked to technologies, high-end services

217
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,620
and these.

218
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,180
When you look at the structure of labor market,

219
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,940
you see that typically metropolitan areas

220
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:34,860
These also show a higher share of highly educated, highly educated work.

221
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:41,620
So substantially bigger, say in the delta metropolis,

222
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,500
it's 30% of highly educated people compared

223
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,820
to more or less 20% in the rest of the netlands.

224
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,220
And you can have a look at the other cities

225
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,620
to see how it fits.

226
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,660
So a different kind of labor market structure,

227
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,260
which tells us something about the kinds of activities

228
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,940
that are probably taking place there.

229
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:08,100
And another indicator there is when you look at

230
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,980
the employment figures across different kinds of sectors.

231
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,740
So there's the three sector model

232
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,420
that's agriculture industry and services.

233
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,340
And we see that obviously agriculture is very small,

234
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,180
but that's a constant everywhere,

235
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,420
but that there's a significant large share

236
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,980
and services in these metropolitan areas

237
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,180
than in the rest of the country.

238
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,740
So it's, these are places that are not marked

239
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,260
by industry, but by service economies.

240
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,020
So these are just a number of exhibits

241
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,980
that tell you something about the economic importance,

242
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,020
but it doesn't really tell you why these places are important.

243
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,500
It's just kind of a hint that something is going on.

244
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,580
And actually you already mentioned quite a few ideas

245
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,100
of how we can theorize the centrality

246
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,380
or at least conceptualize the centrality and power

247
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,180
in off cities in the global economy.

248
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:14,300
One of the main texts that is in the reader for this week

249
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,900
was this relatively hypothesis by John

250
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,660
to throw red it so you can just interrupt me

251
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,460
if you want to interject something.

252
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,740
But I just want to give you a number of notes

253
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,300
of my personal notes on what John Friedman was actually

254
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
writing about.

255
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,460
So a bit of context to this thesis or high hypothesis,

256
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,220
it's a hypothesis that groups a number of observations

257
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,940
from the 1980s tries to come up with a bit of a research

258
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,140
a gentle, that meets empirical testing.

259
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Right?

260
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,420
But you need to understand a bit more of this context

261
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,540
of the 1980s.

262
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,300
People of my age have to have the habit of starting history

263
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,100
in the 1980s, because it was the decade they were born.

264
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,940
If I was 10 years older, I was probably

265
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,540
going to refer the 1970s.

266
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,940
But as a toddler, this was my context, right?

267
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,140
So you have to remember that 1980s was this emerging kind

268
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:24,860
idea that we would experience the end of the city. It was the rise of information and

269
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,380
communication technology on a very democratic large scale, not yet the internet, but that was

270
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:37,740
emerging in the 1990s and being democratized, cheap mass transportation became very cheap to fly around

271
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:46,700
the world, shipping became something that was very affordable and what we kind of see is a complete

272
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:54,140
restructuring of the economy, this kind of reaching its high day in the 1980s. It was already going

273
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:01,500
on in the 60s and 70s, but by the 1980s what became obvious is that we are in a new situation,

274
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:09,660
which we'd call the new international division of labor with new kinds of geographies of production,

275
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:16,620
much more to the global east and far less centered on the old industrial areas in,

276
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:22,620
say, European and America, what we've been discussing last week. And we see that this new

277
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:30,540
centrality of cities need theorize. If cities are not the places where a lot of goods are produced

278
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,580
and hence where you get some kind of a trade surplus when you start trading these commodities,

279
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,780
say textiles, etc. with other places in the world. What is then the kind of source of power

280
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,620
that cities actually hold? And what John Friedman comes up with is a look to answer this question.

281
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,220
We have to look at how cities are actually being inserted. And indeed an urban system that is not

282
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:58,140
only national but a separate national is actually a global urban system. You have to understand it

283
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,860
And most in the 1970s, a lot of the tradition in urban geography was looking at urban systems

284
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,380
in a very nationalist way.

285
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,460
It was a methodological nationalism.

286
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,940
It was looking at Argentina.

287
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,060
You have Buenos Aires, which was the central city.

288
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,100
And then you had a number of smaller towns.

289
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,540
But there was a huge concentration there.

290
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,500
And it left to some blind spot, as to what actually the position of these cities were

291
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,140
and processes that went beyond national economies.

292
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,860
And as these processes became ever more prominent,

293
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,260
it requested a huge--

294
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,460
you could say conceptual innovation that started

295
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,220
to emerge in 1970s and it is hence

296
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,860
the importance of freedom theorizing, conceptualizing

297
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,700
about world city.

298
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,020
So a global urban system and the kind of main underlying

299
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,660
hypothesis-- sorry, yes.

300
00:21:52,660 --> 00:22:02,820
So the last part, what I was saying is that you have processes of globalization, which means

301
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,200
that the way that urban geographers were looking at urban systems, the king obsolete

302
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
in one way or another.

303
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:17,540
They were mostly linked to how economies were functioning at the national scale, looking

304
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,200
into, could say, where productivity is located, how could we

305
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,760
get flows organized, how capital flows, etc.

306
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:33,320
But as an increased share of the economy became, you could say, international or transnational.

307
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,920
Yes, the first thing that needed to happen was some kind of a conceptual framework or apparatus

308
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,520
that allowed to understand centrality at a different level.

309
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,560
But differently, instead of talking about national urban systems, people started talking

310
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:52,440
about global urban systems. But looking at centralities. So what

311
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,040
freedom kind of started to argue also on the basis of his reading of David

312
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,120
Harvey in 1970's Ammano Acastels is that we can only understand what goes on in

313
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,560
cities if we relate that to the position of these places in this global

314
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,320
urban system. So it's the kind of their function that they take in the global

315
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,520
economy or rather in this global urban system that will have to explain

316
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:23,120
what we find in certain places. Turn around on the other side of that corn is that this global

317
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,120
urban system or this global economy can also be embarked explained through what is going on in

318
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,280
P global cities or in this case world cities. We use the terminology. So, it's the processes that

319
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,720
emerge and are steered and controlled from these places that will have an impact on them.

320
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,040
larger macro processes in the global economy.

321
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,280
So that's kind of this dialectic global system,

322
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,240
macro level urban system world cities,

323
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,240
and they're kind of co-productive or co-constitative.

324
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,680
So one of the main excerpts are key observed excerpts there

325
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,240
from his world to the hypothesis, which is kind of very point

326
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,160
is key cities throughout the world are used

327
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,120
by global capital as basing points

328
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,760
in the spatial organization and articulation

329
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,960
of production and markets.

330
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,040
The resulting linkages make it possible to arrange a world

331
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,480
cities into a complex spatial hierarchy.

332
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,840
So it's about appreciating how indeed capital is--

333
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,280
and its actors--

334
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,320
is kind of basing itself in cities as they organize

335
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,400
global production and commercial activities.

336
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
So that was kind of the main focus.

337
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,840
And if we understand that, we will start explaining

338
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,600
why certain places are important and others less,

339
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,360
and why some cities are dependent on this process,

340
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,240
and why others are actually powerful.

341
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,120
So yeah, as I said, it's a period of view economic restructuring.

342
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,760
The laws of a lot of functions that were typically taking place

343
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,760
in cities, and I mean, John Friedman was writing

344
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:12,160
from Los Angeles, which was a very production-centered town

345
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,480
or city.

346
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,320
And it was losing functions.

347
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,760
What he observed was still a huge concentration

348
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,720
of skyscrapers, portraits, head porches.

349
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,000
But production had long left.

350
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,440
So this kind of conundrum was how do we explain that?

351
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
How do we make sense?

352
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,200
And indeed, as I've been explaining,

353
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,280
you had as the new international division of labor activities

354
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,200
that were being off-short to other parts of the globe.

355
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,840
And the emergence of a new set of enterprises, corporations,

356
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,080
multinational corporations, if you could say,

357
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,840
an American firm would be globalizing

358
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,440
or multinational corporations where it was actually kind of hard

359
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,240
to still identify to what extent

360
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,920
they were still connected with some territory.

361
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,120
Yes?

362
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Let me say that the production activity has low left.

363
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,120
What is the expectation of these production activities?

364
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I mean, it was the question when I was reading the text.

365
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,280
- Yeah, I mean, obviously it would depend on the city

366
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,480
that we're talking about, but think about what happens

367
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,400
in cities like Brussels, I mean textile industry,

368
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,960
all kinds of production facilities for consumer goods

369
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,200
that were initially

370
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
I mean, think about washing machines,

371
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
in editing that you use in the kitchen.

372
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,200
These were typically produced in the post-door era

373
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,200
in, you could say, the high income industrialized countries.

374
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
But because there was, you could say, pressure on the profitability

375
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,200
of these activities, because the wages were rather high.

376
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,200
These activities were offshore by a national,

377
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,840
emotional and not in national corporations.

378
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,280
And one of the main motivations was the search

379
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,160
for lower wages.

380
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,320
Or you could say, let's regulate labor markets

381
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,640
than what was occurring in the traditional industrial areas.

382
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Yes?

383
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
[INAUDIBLE]

384
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
[INAUDIBLE]

385
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,520
You make other countries, others.

386
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,440
and this bill is in just one thing,

387
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,440
all the other firms are the big things.

388
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,520
So, so they need to be for a different experience

389
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,120
and moving everything in the world

390
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,360
to have kind of summer.

391
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,640
- Yes, yeah, indeed.

392
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,840
I mean, and sometimes a little bit of confusion there

393
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,120
because people sometimes say, okay,

394
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,440
the industrial activities shifted to the periphery.

395
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,920
So I think in the first instance,

396
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
it's the initial periphery of the city.

397
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,960
I mean, the volume is suburbs.

398
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,200
But I think even, and it had something to do with,

399
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,680
you can say more,

400
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,400
the urban geographies, the land trends,

401
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,440
the ground prices in cities,

402
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,200
because it's, I mean, in large surfaces.

403
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,400
And it's easier to organize the rifries,

404
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,640
but at the later stage, they would basically,

405
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,800
I mean, these activities were either cut

406
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,760
because of investment and technology

407
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,360
and because you needed less jobs.

408
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:30,360
to make the same products and for there were shifted to other places around the globe.

409
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,360
So this is kind of what started to occur.

410
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,360
I mean some people even in some industries it was already in the 1950s.

411
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,360
This didn't happen over a day.

412
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:49,360
But it culminated if you were in the 70s and then the early 80s, which was a period of crisis in a lot of cities.

413
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,280
So, yeah, this new type of corporate,

414
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
actable to national corporations,

415
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,120
transnational corporations,

416
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,400
and how they organize global production networks.

417
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,640
So, a production network that used to be

418
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,520
kind of regionalized,

419
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,040
or nationalized in one way or another,

420
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,320
relied on local suppliers,

421
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,800
ended up being global.

422
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,520
I mean, if you have tried to order a bike in the past one year,

423
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,600
you know what it means to depend on

424
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,120
global supply chains or production networks, it's just an intensely fine-tuned process.

425
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,600
If anything goes wrong, I don't know, a tanker blocking the Suez Canal or something.

426
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,760
It's a precarious situation, but that's the kind of reality global supply chains.

427
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,000
And it's a part of the economy that's extremely dominated by these multinational corporations.

428
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,600
just some figures. I mean, there's a timeline there in 1960, there's about 66 billion.

429
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:54,160
What was kind of foreign direct investment, sort of for the technical terms here, but it means

430
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:01,040
direct investment in setting up factories. So you build a plant somewhere else,

431
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,760
so like Mercedes-Benz builds a plant in Korea or something, I'm not sure if they did.

432
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,280
are two-yota builds of plans in Texas.

433
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,800
In this kind of foreign direct investment logic,

434
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,680
M, it boom basically.

435
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,360
And you look at the figure of the 2016,

436
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,800
I could update that, I should probably do that.

437
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
About the third of the global economy

438
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,960
is actually equivalent to these,

439
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,360
and the I think, yes.

440
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,040
Foreign direct investment.

441
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,920
It's not too important,

442
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,280
but you just have to understand

443
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,920
that this is a measure of transnational flows.

444
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,920
So it's a measure of what part of the economy

445
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,920
is not local but is actually global or transnational.

446
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,680
And it relates to the investment activities

447
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:00,720
while large corporations to set up greenfield investments

448
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,840
as a skull.

449
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,680
So imagine a greenfield where you put into factory

450
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:13,920
those such as Brownfield redevelopment, which is an ex-site, which is then a refurbished

451
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
or one way or another.

452
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay, so these are those kind of activities.

453
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,920
So 90% of this global economy of this FDI is concentrated in these multinational corporations

454
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,040
and slowly getting to my point here.

455
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,560
This is also why John Freeman was looking at multinational corporations and their geographies

456
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,000
to identify and conceptualize world cities.

457
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,780
So for jump treatment,

458
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,400
treatment at the cities where a lot of these headquarters

459
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,180
by these international corporations were located,

460
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,640
were, I mean, those were those cities

461
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,520
that they identified as world cities.

462
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,320
So since they saw important in the global ecosystem.

463
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,320
Okay.

464
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,360
So as he says, world cities are then to be sites

465
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,720
for command and control.

466
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,920
And he really saw these corporate headquarters

467
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,280
as the place is that controls and command it

468
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,640
in various ways, either to governance systems

469
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,400
by decision making, by the internal structure,

470
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,120
how global production was being organized.

471
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,920
And his kind of methodological hypothesis

472
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:29,400
was if we map these headquarter geographies,

473
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,560
we will actually be able to map the global urban system.

474
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:40,040
And we'll also understand the relation between different kind of cities as to who controls

475
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,280
what.

476
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,520
So it's a way to look at the power in this global urban network.

477
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,560
Some places are more dominant, hold more command and control functions than others.

478
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Okay.

479
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:57,640
So I then came up with this map or cartogram or whatever you want to call it.

480
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,720
And yeah, it's certainly dated because Soviet Union is still on there and it's not

481
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,720
not part of this figure, which is also debatable.

482
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,400
Maybe there were not, I mean, say,

483
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,680
your American corporate headquarters there,

484
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,520
but for sure there were links,

485
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,520
even with the Soviet Union and capitalist countries, for sure.

486
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,440
But the whole point is that what Friedman actually does here

487
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,440
is translate the critical tradition of world systems theory,

488
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,560
which is a way to explain uneven development

489
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,800
in the global economy to an urban framework.

490
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,160
So it identifies three kind of areas, globalization,

491
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,400
arenas, if you will, one centered on Asia,

492
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,480
one on North America, one on Western Europe.

493
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,200
And typically, it finds a power balance

494
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,040
where you have powerful cities with a lot of corporate headquarters

495
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,040
in, you could say, the northern part of the hemisphere

496
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,760
and more, you could say, subordinate roles

497
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,920
for countries in the global south.

498
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,960
So when you, for instance, look at Northern America,

499
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,680
you have Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York,

500
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,160
which are identified as core cities with a lot of headquarters.

501
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,800
And they're kind of organizational networks

502
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,000
stretch to the global periphery.

503
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,440
So there's connections with the Rio de Janeiro, for instance,

504
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,080
Buenos Aires.

505
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,880
And these are kind of semi peripheral cities

506
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,000
who also hold command and control functions

507
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,880
and headquarters, they're oriented towards these centers

508
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,440
in the global north, could be that there are subsidiaries

509
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,760
of large corporations that are organized in such a concept.

510
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,040
So it's a way to explain how power is distributed

511
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,560
in this global urban system, and also starts

512
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,280
to explain why perhaps some places benefit more

513
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,720
from this integration in the global urban system than others.

514
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,040
So it would probably lead to an accumulation of wealth

515
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,480
in cities in the global north, to some extent,

516
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,520
also in the Senate periphery, think about Rio de Janeiro.

517
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,840
But at the same time, it would also work

518
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,160
as some kind of a funnel of siphon

519
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,960
off a siphon actually of surface toward the global north.

520
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,200
For instance, a US corporation producing stuff

521
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,920
energy, data, in part there will be benefits locally but at the same time there will also

522
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,360
be an extraction of surface value to the global market.

523
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:38,200
So it's also a way to understand, believe in this global economy.

524
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,320
I know it's a lot, sometimes a lot of economic terms but just to give you an idea, a

525
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,920
restructured global economy and the imaginary of a global urban system and city-staking

526
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,160
and different role in that on the basis of their command and control functions which

527
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,840
frequently defines as headquarters functions. So that's world cities. World cities,

528
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,200
corporate headquarters, command and control. I'm just giving you a number of key concepts there.

529
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,520
A second way of theorizing it is, and that's why I also have the other texts,

530
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,600
I could have given you the entire book, the Global City, but it would have taken you a week,

531
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,960
probably, or at least a few days to actually read it. It's still in flight to Dusso, but it's a kind of

532
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:34,720
shorter kind of version of the argument, which kind of explains what centrality is to

533
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,880
Saskia Susson. Okay, but I'll give you a bit more context by referring also to her book,

534
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,640
the global city. So one of, you could say, what has been

535
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,400
argued to be one of the seminal pieces talking about cities in

536
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,880
globalization, it starts kind of from the same rooms as

537
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,560
Richmond. I mean, it had been a very intense conversation in

538
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,640
the 1980s about what is going on with cities, they have

539
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,280
shifting functions, they're faced with the industrialization,

540
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,240
etc. There's also fiscal crisis of the local state. A lot of

541
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,000
cities were in trouble if you saw the movie.

542
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,800
Pixie Driver with the young Robert Teneiro,

543
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,040
he's driving around the relaxed New York in a city

544
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,320
neighborhoods are in trouble.

545
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,800
There's a lot of blight.

546
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,960
So cities were struggling to think about what

547
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,640
our functions could be and what is going on, especially

548
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,200
in 1970s, is a complete restructuring of these urban

549
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,240
economies.

550
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,840
So for Susson, it's less only about, you could say,

551
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,720
new command and control function about headquarters.

552
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,920
She looks at the complete restructuring of urban economies

553
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,960
from, you could say, manufacturing jobs

554
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,480
to service economies.

555
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,360
So we already saw that the majority of economic activities

556
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,920
in metropolitan areas are services.

557
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,240
But she particularly focuses on a particular subset

558
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,640
of these services, which equals advanced producer services.

559
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,720
So in the coming months, you will probably

560
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,360
start to hate the notion of advanced producer

561
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,320
services or being treated by it.

562
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,440
But it's a kind of--

563
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,120
I mean, you probably never heard about it.

564
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,800
A night of the day I, before I ever read about it.

565
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,080
But it tells it's kind of trying to capture those very

566
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,240
sophisticated, if you will, professional services

567
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,520
and service inputs for other firms.

568
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,560
So in themselves, they don't really produce much.

569
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,720
But still, their input is very important

570
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,480
for other corporations.

571
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,900
Think about financial services,

572
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,600
law, management, consultancy, accounting,

573
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,720
and auditing, advertising, et cetera, et cetera.

574
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,800
So these are not really producing things

575
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,960
that you can buy and consume at some point.

576
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,720
This is actually very knowledge intensive,

577
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,320
sometimes it's also called knowledge intensive business services,

578
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,160
which are kind of consumed as the art produced.

579
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,160
So legal advice is kind of produced in face-to-face meetings.

580
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:19,480
Think about a corporation that wants to set up a shop

581
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,040
or a plant or an investment in China, a European firm.

582
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Probably you want to check, I think we are too, with a large international law firm that can give you a lot of experience as to what the regulations are for investment and other China.

583
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,880
you would need dedicated financial services.

584
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,200
How do you finance your international expansion?

585
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,280
You would need the advice of auditing firms accounting firms

586
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,240
because probably you want to attract some further funding

587
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,120
by issuing, I don't know, stocks above,

588
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,600
or something like that.

589
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,720
So financial investors would want to look at your activities.

590
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,560
Advertising, yes, how are you going to sell your cookies, cars, et cetera in China?

591
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,720
You need to know something about the local market or local markets, the sensitivities.

592
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,240
So yeah, you may want to adapt your practices there.

593
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:32,000
You may need to advise of management consultants because you may say that you want to globalize, but how are you going to

594
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,560
manages process, what kind of responsibilities do you give

595
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,320
to your managers in China?

596
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,520
Then they have the autonomy to take decisions.

597
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,760
Will you work with the central command structure?

598
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,360
How will you think about the profitability

599
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,840
of your activities, et cetera?

600
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,360
I mean, it's not a course in business studies here,

601
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,680
but just imagine as a firm that you want to globalize,

602
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,320
there's a lot of things that enter into the picture.

603
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,480
And probably these kinds of inputs that you need

604
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,040
are so specialized,

605
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,240
does it make sense to start producing them yourself?

606
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,320
So you just buy very specialized inputs.

607
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,400
You get in touch with lawyers, consultants, et cetera.

608
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,200
They would fly in and charge the hell out of you

609
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,200
and then run off and maybe a direct advice was, okay.

610
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,160
So it shifts to the service economy.

611
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,480
but with the globalization of production and globalization of markets and financial markets,

612
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,400
we see that certain service firms are becoming increasingly important.

613
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,960
And these are these advanced producer services, services given to producing firms.

614
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,040
And what she says is, look, instead of looking at headquarters of corporations,

615
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,080
we best look not at the multinationals themselves, but we best look at where these APS

616
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,280
firms are located.

617
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,120
And it's not just that they have kind of cold control

618
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,820
over global productions, networks, as you could

619
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,600
imagine, corporate headquarters where

620
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,920
CEO with a big cigar takes a decision of slashing

621
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,320
10,000 jobs in Belgium or something.

622
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:25,840
It's more dilute, diluted form of control,

623
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,080
which he talks about, is more about control capabilities.

624
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,760
is the assemblage, or we could say,

625
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,680
in the entire mixture of these kind of service economies

626
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,720
that allows firms that use these services

627
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,240
to exert control of the global scale.

628
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,440
So multinational corporations that

629
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,720
have a long story to start short depends

630
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,840
on yet another set of players, advancement use the services

631
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,040
to actually be able to manage global production.

632
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,800
So that's kind of her reading, not just corporate headquarters, but look at these notes

633
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,720
of advanced producers.

634
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,160
And the second important element that she links to that and will talk more about that

635
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,160
next week, and because it's a slightly different topic, is that this APS economy, this high

636
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:24,800
and service economies, also is an important engine in producing polarization, the other kind

637
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,440
of process that could use polarized cities, but an important driver according to Susson

638
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:41,120
is the highly remunerated salary stop in these kind of activities and this will have an

639
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:48,720
effect on this city. So it produces an outcome where you have high and low skilled labor forces

640
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,480
in APS or around APS.

641
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,400
And at some point, it could also even

642
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,680
lead to what she calls the peripheralization of the core.

643
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,040
So there will be a drive also to boost informal labor

644
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,920
markets in parts of the local economy.

645
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,360
But we'll talk more about that next thing.

646
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,120
So that's her idea about global cities.

647
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,480
And in the end, global cities

648
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,280
a site for the production of specialized services needed by complex organizations for running

649
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,180
a spatially diverse dispersed network of factors offices and services out there.

650
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,060
The production of financial innovations and the making of markets both central to the

651
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,080
internationalization expansion of the financial industry.

652
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,520
So for Sussan it's both about and you're free to refer to Sussan because it rhymes

653
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,240
with lessons as other students have done so before and make movies about.

654
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,760
So it's both about global production networks but also the running of global financial

655
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,920
markets.

656
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,560
So it's not just the production of goods themselves but also connecting to the world of

657
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,400
finance to get investment in these production.

658
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,160
So that's what SARS-CoS-CoS-CoS is talking about.

659
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:10,480
And the paradox that she sees is that as there's a kind of a dispersion of activities

660
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,800
at the same time there's a growing need for concentration.

661
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,880
The more dispersed global production networks,

662
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,640
the common financial markets,

663
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,520
the more the need for centralized control

664
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,840
or control capabilities over these markets.

665
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,280
So that's kind of the paradox of cities,

666
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,560
despite the internet, et cetera,

667
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,200
or virtualization of activities,

668
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,920
there's a continued role for face-to-face interaction

669
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,600
and interpretation in limited set of cities.

670
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,440
So why are APS located in a limited number of cities?

671
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,920
Well, she talks about different kinds of thought dependence.

672
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,440
So it means that one situation establishes itself

673
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,600
is kind of the whole kinds of self-reinforcing mechanisms.

674
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,540
So if there's a concentration, there's a deep market

675
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,440
and services.

676
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,360
So if you go to London, for instance, you're

677
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,800
quite sure that you will find everything.

678
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,240
If you have these kind of services,

679
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,640
some kind of a labor market culture

680
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,680
where we'll emerge around that.

681
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,520
You'll find a specialized labor there.

682
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,520
And yeah, in a lot of world and global cities think about New York

683
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,720
or London, some kind of a Yup culture,

684
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,720
young urban professional culture,

685
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,680
has emerged within these kinds of APS firms.

686
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,720
There's also a lot of synergies between these firms

687
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
and I'll tell you a little bit more about that.

688
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,880
So also these different KBS firms work together

689
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,240
as they service their clients.

690
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,680
And what is even more striking is that these APS firms

691
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,840
in and of themselves also become global corporations.

692
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,640
So they also set up international networks

693
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,960
either to follow their clients

694
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,960
or to remain credible as a global, as a vehicle act.

695
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:12,680
So a number of reasons why this kind of geography reproduces itself and is increasingly anchored

696
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,440
in a number and a limited number of global cities.

697
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:24,880
So my barracks, for my dear colleague from the Metu-Yehan Kickingen, who did a kind of

698
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,760
nice set of maps on law firms and Brussels.

699
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,720
It's kind of interesting to see that the concentration in global cities, you could say,

700
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,720
when at the more abstract level also translate into clusters

701
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,520
at the metropolitan level.

702
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,320
And that tells us something about, you can say,

703
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,440
the more micro-sociologies and geographies

704
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,160
of these kind of professional serves.

705
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,840
So what you see is on the left-hand side, the law firms.

706
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,200
The big picture of foreign law firms, the smaller insect

707
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,400
map is Belt and Ferns, the number of commonalities

708
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,120
avenue in these which is kind of center of a very rich neighborhoods or set of neighborhoods

709
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,860
and some Brussels as a location of boats. I think Belgian,

710
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:18,560
a group of people. I love from the local garden offer. What is foreign law firms or what

711
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:25,200
is special? For the foreign law firms they're very much concentrated around the EU district.

712
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,440
Okay, so a lot of activities

713
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,640
I'd have something to do with the client or clients

714
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,920
that are located there, which is either directly

715
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,920
European Commission or firms that want to not be

716
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,400
European Commission.

717
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,240
And this is kind of a process that we'll talk a bit more

718
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,240
when we do the tour and Brussels in the end of next week.

719
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,500
So micro geographies are also produced micro clusters

720
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,320
produced at the urban level.

721
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,680
The same is Vincent Stu in London.

722
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,040
Some great work by Cook at all.

723
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,440
Not Captain Cook, but another cook.

724
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,000
So we cook top this figure.

725
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,920
Obviously what you see there is a city of London,

726
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,440
which is also a very particular jurisdiction

727
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,560
in and of itself.

728
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,640
It has some kind of an exceptional room

729
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,600
that doesn't follow the regulations of, you could say,

730
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,120
the continent in this case of the UK and enough itself.

731
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,800
It's governed in a very weird way.

732
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,200
I never recall how exactly.

733
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,160
I don't know if you can make sure that the bridge is themselves.

734
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,720
But it's kind of a self-port,

735
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,040
I mean, the self-regulate itself,

736
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,200
governed jurisdiction on the island,

737
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,040
where corporations also have a large say in.

738
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,240
So within the limits of the long run, you find particular regulations there.

739
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,640
That's why the stock exchanges located there.

740
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,280
And all the financial institutions are located around.

741
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,920
And then besides that, the specialized district, the legal district, etc.

742
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,480
So the tendency of seeking proximity is also evident there.

743
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,440
A bit more on this, because of ABS complex, as I said, these firms also

744
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:23,760
interacted one another. So this is some work we did in Brussels. We took a corporate survey

745
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:31,600
aimed at APS professionals so we sent the survey around with with legal experts, expert,

746
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:37,920
ICT experts, etcetera, bankers and they kind of listed how they interacted with other APS firms

747
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,480
either in their daily practice for themselves or as they were giving service to their customs.

748
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:51,280
Okay, and what you find is actually quite a bit of interaction with sector itself.

749
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,160
And also particularly between sectors in law and finance, law,

750
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,920
accounts, and law, and accounts in financial services.

751
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:09,200
So just imagine as a corporation, what often happens is that when you issue some kind of financial

752
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,200
of product, think about a share or something

753
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,960
or you want to go for a loan.

754
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,880
Namely the financial institution, we need a law firm.

755
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,400
That needs to kind of come up with the prospectus

756
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,320
or check the prospectus that is made by financial institutions,

757
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,080
auditors and accountants that have a look at it.

758
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:36,080
So this is a kind of connected thing to financial markets.

759
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,280
What we also found is quite some interaction

760
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,920
between ICT and financial services.

761
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,080
This has something to do with,

762
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,080
you can say the virtualization of finance

763
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,000
that is currently going on.

764
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,600
So quite a bit of interdependencies

765
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,360
between different sectors will also explain

766
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,720
why does a need for proximity?

767
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,880
Yes, that's a question.

768
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,800
That's a very good question.

769
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,360
What do I remember from these percentages?

770
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,600
I think, all right.

771
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,200
So I think that it's standardized to the,

772
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,680
you could say the largest link.

773
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,440
So we looked at, you could say the intensity of interactions.

774
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,200
And we found that within financial services,

775
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,760
this has the strongest link.

776
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,760
So it's a relative scale.

777
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,760
So that's the strongest link.

778
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,000
It's 100%.

779
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,840
And then when you for instance look at the duration

780
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,480
between law and financial services,

781
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,680
the strength of the time between law and finance is only half of the kind of relations

782
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,720
within the finance itself.

783
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:45,920
It was measured in a different way.

784
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,680
It's measured by frequency.

785
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:58,000
So on a regular basis, how much do you hire advice in, you could say, "No, it's

786
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,280
or et cetera.

787
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,920
But there's other ways of measuring that for sure.

788
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,200
So it's one way of doing that.

789
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,560
So yes, this kind of gravitational pull towards other actors

790
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,720
in this APS complex explains kind of the reproduction

791
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,160
of global cities.

792
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,400
And another one was indeed this globalization

793
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,960
of strategies of APS firms themselves.

794
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,000
So they're both clustered and they're

795
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,520
globalized at the same time, deloed--

796
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,120
well, I mean, it's part of its branding process.

797
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,400
HSBC is the same thing.

798
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,200
So it's playing on both being global and tapping

799
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,320
into local knowledge.

800
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,560
You may think about that what we want,

801
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,760
but it's certainly part of their corporate strategy,

802
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,240
the geographical strategy, et cetera.

803
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,240
Yes?

804
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:52,760
OK.

805
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,760
- I think that's the public early days,

806
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,640
but I think that's what we have all about,

807
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,160
how open and forward to performance

808
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,160
that's been happening.

809
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,160
- No, I was taking care of my children.

810
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,680
But I think that's a good point.

811
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,680
I mean, I think for sure, there has been a tremendous impact

812
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,640
on business travel.

813
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,080
But it's also kind of a long discussion

814
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,320
as to what extent you need business travel

815
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,680
these are the video conferencing and all the kinds of things.

816
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,800
So there's already quite a bit of research in there.

817
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,280
There's also, you can say, more ethnographic approaches

818
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,080
that are kind of questioning the actual day-to-day

819
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,840
relevance of having a global network.

820
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,640
But definitely, artists offices really being used,

821
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,120
or I think they need there to have an address

822
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,640
and populate websites.

823
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,000
And then you may actually find that it's much more

824
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,360
concentrated within a number of global cities

825
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,040
despite having a very global network.

826
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,160
And it could be other ways of organizing yourself.

827
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,000
I haven't done very clusters or meetings or conferences

828
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,160
to make things work.

829
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,440
That there's also, and we'll read a bit about that,

830
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,760
practice of the governments of people that are based

831
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,400
in London, that are then two years based in Singapore.

832
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,680
So there are a lot of kind of strategies.

833
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:24,880
But yeah, the main kind of question in the DB is COVID.

834
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,520
Now the final proof that there's an end to the city,

835
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,560
I think that's hugely overblown.

836
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,760
And I think there's quite a bit of reasons

837
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,080
about the knowledge and density of certain practices

838
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,720
that explains why face-to-face interaction will prevail.

839
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,600
Just as when you think about teaching,

840
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,080
There's hopefully some added value to face the face teaching

841
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,400
overlooking at a screen.

842
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,800
And it has something to do with the interpretation

843
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,600
of information and is being shared about how

844
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,560
grounding processes work.

845
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,200
We think the same about certain concepts, et cetera.

846
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,000
And if you don't do this face-to-face,

847
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,920
you just miss out on this micro feedback loop.

848
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,240
If this would be online, I wouldn't see

849
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,880
nodding or frowning, so I would be in trouble sometimes.

850
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,120
But I think it's clearly, it's a very important question.

851
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,960
There will probably be a more strategic use of these sites,

852
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,520
and there will also be a more selective use

853
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,520
of face inflection, which would, I'm ultimately also

854
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,480
input, input, APS activities, and your geographies.

855
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:44,080
But it won't do a dissolution, I think, personally.

856
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,660
I see no theoretical reasons why that should be obsolete.

857
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:52,880
But it's research that could be done.

858
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,400
I mean, there's a whole class of people, digital nomads.

859
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,400
These are more, you could say, self-employed.

860
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,320
They don't depend on other inputs.

861
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,960
And their production process think about setting up

862
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
a website or something.

863
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,760
You can just go to Bali and do that from there.

864
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,840
But even there you see the emergence of temporary clusters,

865
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,680
other digital nomads that are in Bali,

866
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,360
discuss stuff, et cetera, et cetera.

867
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:27,080
So I think even there is a social aspect to that.

868
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,720
And you get the return of centrality,

869
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,960
even where you don't expect it.

870
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,400
And it seems to be something that is related to the fact

871
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,840
that we're talking about cognitive cultural capitalism.

872
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:45,560
And that's an excellent bridge to what Alan Scott is talking about

873
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,240
in his version of Global Siki regions.

874
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,280
So we talked about world cities, or the headquarters

875
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,040
Susson talks about global cities.

876
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,920
You look into a wider complex of these advanced services

877
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,720
that sit around corporations.

878
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:05,000
And then Alan Scott says, well, you and your world

879
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,840
and global cities have to explain something like this,

880
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:14,720
which is a much larger coloration, which is urban to some extent,

881
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,040
which depends here on San Francisco,

882
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,280
and it's easy to notice.

883
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,520
But how do you make sense of this wider San Francisco Bay area

884
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,720
with a lot of, you could say, centrality,

885
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,000
but it's not necessarily connected

886
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,320
to core metropolitan areas.

887
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,800
So what kind of--

888
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,960
and Scott is talking about it says, yes,

889
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,280
very nice that we talk about this classic.

890
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,160
world and global cities when you look for South Africa, South Asia, South Asia,

891
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:49,280
North New York, London, Tokyo, later on Chicago, and meet metropolitan areas.

892
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,640
But there's other kind of structures, morphological structures,

893
00:58:53,640 --> 00:59:03,080
polycentric regions that do not necessarily fit the definition that South

894
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,560
assassin or John Friedman is talking about. And it also links a little bit to what we discussed

895
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:15,880
last week. How the city looks like or where the urban is can actually spill over metropolitan

896
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:24,840
areas. Okay. So clearly places like Silicon Valley. They're not dependent on the poor urban area

897
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:32,920
per se, but they're also kind of an example of the need for proximity in high-end advanced

898
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:43,960
sectors. So what our consensus is that, yes, something is right, but the kind of wider

899
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:49,960
process that is going on is a process towards centrality in knowledge-intensive

900
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:56,600
activities. And this pertains to APS firms that are located and you can see the core

901
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:03,880
metropolitan areas, but it also applies to high-tech firms, the GAFAS platform corporations,

902
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:12,100
etc, etc, all these kind of innovations that came out of sort of conf

903
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,100
of the confederate since, or when you look at the per-refrigerate delta, which is a kind of much more

904
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:21,800
of all-centric production area in the southeast of China. It's also a form of centrality,

905
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,540
where you have some metropolitan areas or metropolitan course, but it also goes

906
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:33,820
beyond there. So what interests our Scott is more, yeah, this driver of centrality, built

907
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:40,640
APS themselves. And he says, look, this centrality that SARS-CoS-SUSAN finds is actually part and

908
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:48,860
part of a wider shift towards cognitive cultural captions. Right? So CCC and it means that

909
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:55,740
a lot of economic activities, crucially depends on knowledge inputs.

910
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,700
And types of knowledge that are not generic,

911
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:03,860
not standardized, that are not easily appreciable

912
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,020
at a distance.

913
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:08,740
No, you need interpretation, dialogue with clients,

914
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:11,540
dialogue with other colleagues to make

915
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:16,060
sense of what is going on, because it's a very complex matter.

916
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,940
need to make sense of the situation collectively,

917
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,140
and hence there's a drive for proximity there.

918
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,140
Okay?

919
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:28,140
And this applies to an increased part of the economy,

920
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:32,620
which also means that it's a goes way beyond

921
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,220
how it produces services.

922
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:39,380
So, and the spatial form it takes is one of global city regions.

923
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,740
So you have more,

924
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,980
pulling more frequency,

925
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,860
polycentric kind of structure.

926
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,460
And his kind of metagography, if you will,

927
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,100
is a world of global city regions,

928
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,580
that has kind of interconnection, interconnected

929
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,860
and blazer role in these global production

930
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,620
networks in global markets.

931
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,620
Yes.

932
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,740
Hi, can you really understand my news

933
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:04,740
about how we can from China to India or APS?

934
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:05,300
Yeah.

935
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,020
Because as I understand that, the [INAUDIBLE]

936
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:16,020
And this need is kind of connection to this ABS that are all this service has connected to.

937
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:23,020
Well, the point by Scott is that, yes, an ABS law firm's fund, etc.

938
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:27,020
There's a clear need for proximity to the reasons that we've been discussing,

939
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:31,020
but there's also a place to other parts of the economy.

940
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:37,020
Think about high-tech, think about education, you know, whatever.

941
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,260
And these are also prone to these agglomeration dynamics.

942
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:46,100
And that is because increasingly the production process

943
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,340
is knowledge intensive.

944
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:51,340
Just compared to, it's a 50 years ago,

945
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,220
it would have been a very standardized process

946
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,300
just make 1,000 cars per week.

947
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,420
This is becoming increasingly customized.

948
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,220
It's much more about prototyping,

949
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:06,500
it's much more about failure in particular cars.

950
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,940
I mean, I don't know anything about cars,

951
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,060
but I'm stuck with cars.

952
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:16,380
So it's much, much more just in time delivery,

953
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,940
it's much more tailored rather than mass production.

954
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:24,100
That used to be the case in the 50s, 60s, 70s,

955
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,460
and this has shifted.

956
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,260
Roughly in the 1980s,

957
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,260
where it was more about flexible production systems,

958
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,100
where you could say the connection with suppliers,

959
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:37,620
but also customers who are in the game much more important.

960
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:41,220
So it's a kind of broad scale restructuring of the economy.

961
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,860
So also explains why proximity matters,

962
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,140
not only in each of those that you serve,

963
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,860
but more broadly to the economy.

964
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:53,500
- But I don't understand what drives this company

965
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,140
to gather instead of providing for example.

966
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,620
- Okay, well, I have a whole lecture on that

967
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,660
and I can look at the lessons, right?

968
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:05,180
But I mean, and part of the story is you could say

969
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,420
the contemporary benefits of economic agglomeration,

970
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:11,140
which has something to do with what economic geographer

971
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,940
calls the externalities.

972
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,060
By being there, you get certain benefits

973
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,140
that you wouldn't get if you're not there,

974
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,140
stepping into high-scale labor,

975
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,120
high-scale labor, for instance,

976
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,020
and venture capitalists, et cetera, et cetera.

977
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,540
But there's a lot of what the whole part of the penancies as well.

978
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:31,380
And we do look at the story of Silicon Valley.

979
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:35,460
used to be a lot of government investment there.

980
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,980
Think US military and the semiconductor business

981
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,060
making chips and those kind of things

982
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,580
was huge funded by the federal government

983
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:49,060
in NASA, DARPA and all kind of ministerial defense.

984
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,820
And a lot of these innovations

985
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,660
were then later on commercialized by private players

986
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,940
who then used these technologies to build their own platforms.

987
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,260
And this great work by my Anna Madzukata, for instance,

988
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,860
through with great economists, says,

989
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:12,860
well, if you look at your iPad, almost every critical element

990
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:15,380
there piece of technology can be related back

991
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:18,940
to some kind of federal investment, et cetera, et cetera.

992
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:23,340
So which brings them to an argument about,

993
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,180
is it really private innovation that we're talking about,

994
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:29,960
or does it have something to do with the sustained investment

995
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,940
by public authorities in these kinds of investments?

996
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,820
The same is true for big pharma, for instance.

997
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:39,060
It's even first easy to come up with the new vaccines,

998
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:43,460
and these are then commercialized by Pfizer, et cetera.

999
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,220
So it's a very complex story, and no clear answer

1000
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,860
is a field of its own.

1001
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:53,220
But what we need to understand is that this proximity

1002
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:57,700
and the centrality goes beyond cities themselves.

1003
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:02,260
OK, so it's much more prevailing process.

1004
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:05,580
But, Phil, I mean, the point being is that at some point

1005
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:09,740
APS firms, even in these global city regions,

1006
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,340
they would still have some kind of a role

1007
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:16,140
to play as connectors, think about Silicon Valley firms

1008
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,620
that come up with new technologies,

1009
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:23,180
or that one can make a profit of these new innovations.

1010
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:28,100
They would have to be kind of certified back then that their intellectual property would be

1011
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:34,580
tetanus probably very likely that would be San Francisco based law firms that would then

1012
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:35,580
specialize.

1013
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:36,580
Okay.

1014
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:37,420
Okay.

1015
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,240
All right.

1016
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,080
Yeah.

1017
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,080
[INAUDIBLE]

1018
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:51,420
Yeah.

1019
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,220
Well, I mean, you now, this kind of--

1020
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,020
these are the debates.

1021
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,380
I'm just rehearsing the date of the 1980s, 90s.

1022
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,340
Slow to get into the Northeast.

1023
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:06,220
We'll move through that throughout the lecture.

1024
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:11,340
But this mainly tries to capture what went on in the 1980s

1025
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:14,140
and what was the starting point, if you will,

1026
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,580
or the theorizing of world and global cities.

1027
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:18,580
[INAUDIBLE]

1028
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:33,060
Yeah.

1029
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:36,860
Well, there, so the question is,

1030
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:39,660
do I extend as the Rust Belt at Global City?

1031
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:43,140
I don't think, I mean, it will.

1032
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:47,260
Alice Scott would really see that as a global city region,

1033
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,500
because it's mostly, you could say,

1034
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,620
a remnants of an older process of industrialization,

1035
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,180
which was much more focused on mass production.

1036
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:59,260
So think about fact-reasoned Pittsburgh, Detroit,

1037
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,420
et cetera, et cetera.

1038
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:08,780
the Ford factory. And this was kind of in the history of the US. It was a kind of process

1039
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:14,820
of industrialization that was finalizing again. But it's returning since the 60s, 70s.

1040
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:20,700
And then you had a switch to the some belt states. A lot of production, especially in the

1041
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:26,140
car industry, was taken over by Japanese investments. And a lot of states were the labor

1042
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:38,520
writes were less protected. So I mean the difference would be to what it's

1043
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:43,540
I mean it's just one example but a question would be to what extent Duke in

1044
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:47,780
this day in age, knowledge and tactic, intensive production activities are

1045
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:51,660
over at the state place in the Rust Belt, think to some extent this is the case

1046
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:55,660
but it wouldn't be an leading example.

1047
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:56,660
I don't want to be exclusive.

1048
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:59,660
I think it could be visualized as such,

1049
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,660
but it would be more of an empirical question

1050
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,660
to what extent is actually taking place.

1051
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:08,660
Whether it's just a morphology of old industrial area,

1052
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,660
like the rural area,

1053
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,660
or whether there's some kind of integrated region,

1054
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,660
which you do see in Silicon Valley

1055
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,660
because it's kind of organized about technology.

1056
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:35,660
We could perhaps argue that it used to be a global city region of yesterday year, but perhaps the globalization was less advanced there and then or at least it would be with the different.

1057
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:38,420
Okay, just to say there's different conceptualization,

1058
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:43,140
that's why to capture function with also the morphology of these places.

1059
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,620
I think it's something to reflect on and comparing where you get.

1060
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:52,420
Yeah, I think in the interest of time,

1061
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:57,260
I will have to move on because I'm using a lot of words.

1062
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,780
I think it's important that things are clear.

1063
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:04,260
Second of all, and I might speed up a little bit,

1064
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:12,020
I want to give you a methodological example of how people actually dealt with this conceptual apparatus

1065
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:20,260
of world and global cities and global city regions to measure these processes or empirically study these processes.

1066
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:25,060
So this is the work by the globalization and world cities research network.

1067
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:31,060
And it basically starts with whatever of questions I mean.

1068
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,740
When you look at some of these claims,

1069
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:38,460
I mean, it's one thing to say, yeah,

1070
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,340
we have the acknowledge growth city formation process

1071
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:44,020
of global city formation process,

1072
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,620
or to say that interurban connections are already important.

1073
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,660
And actually, when you start diving into this,

1074
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,300
you quickly run into trouble.

1075
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:57,220
And this is actually something that was kind of noted

1076
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:01,460
already in the '90s, so a very long time ago,

1077
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:06,260
but I want to give you the entire development of the agenda.

1078
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:11,980
That is actually quite a few insight into world city network

1079
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:12,460
information.

1080
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,740
So we had a number of case studies in the '80s and '90s,

1081
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:19,340
especially with Soskea Sosen, all particular set of cities,

1082
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,260
long the New York et cetera, et cetera.

1083
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,260
There was all kinds of hypotheses and claims

1084
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,900
about the insertion in a global urban system.

1085
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:30,580
But actually, invariably, there was very little insight

1086
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:31,300
into this.

1087
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:35,140
So what connects cities, how central was cities

1088
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,660
in these urban systems?

1089
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:42,860
It was kind of very much an ad hoc answer that you get

1090
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:46,020
to the extent that generally short sets,

1091
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,540
there's even a dirty little secret

1092
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,700
in world cities research.

1093
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,180
Actually, empirically, there's very little

1094
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,740
on the actual connections being made between cities.

1095
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:58,740
So we don't really know a lot about this.

1096
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:02,100
And this is something that kind of a research gap

1097
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,340
to use new liberals,

1098
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:05,460
academic speak,

1099
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:10,300
that globalization and world cities

1100
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,340
with search networks should answer.

1101
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:18,140
And there was a number of ways of trying to do with that.

1102
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:24,100
People tried to work with secondary data in 1990s

1103
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,500
of starting 1990s, thinking about for instance, yeah,

1104
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,260
looking at the flows of airline passengers.

1105
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:40,260
So how are cities connected by airlines?

1106
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,000
And this is gave rise to these kind of hyperb

1107
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,100
type of research that shares you.

1108
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:53,020
It's a raw city network of the basis of airline flows.

1109
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:57,500
Any idea whether this is a viable method.

1110
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:01,420
And we measure the centrality of cities in the global economy

1111
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,980
by using air life flows.

1112
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:06,860
Well.

1113
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:11,360
[INAUDIBLE]

1114
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,340
All right.

1115
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:21,340
[INAUDIBLE]

1116
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:26,660
Yeah, so major airports are not necessarily in closed cities.

1117
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,660
Yeah? Other ideas? Yeah?

1118
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:39,660
I'm going to find any of that as well.

1119
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,660
Oh, okay. Other kinds of sources to be used.

1120
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,660
Okay. So the flow of bitcoins.

1121
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,660
Okay. Yeah.

1122
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:49,660
I mean, more particularly with these kind of data on airline flows, other ideas?

1123
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:50,660
Yes.

1124
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:54,960
This is also a commercial model for a company

1125
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,620
where you hear, absolutely.

1126
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,460
- You're very, very bad at the department.

1127
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,620
- Absolutely, yeah, all right, yes.

1128
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,540
(muffled speaking)

1129
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:11,860
- That's exactly the same.

1130
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,260
I mean, it's debatable.

1131
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,540
I mean, are you measuring economic importance

1132
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,100
or are you measuring economic control?

1133
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:18,940
- Yeah.

1134
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:26,940
[ Inaudible ]

1135
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,940
>> Yeah, that was also the kind of, yeah, there's a hub and spoke system.

1136
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:34,940
People write about papers flying where you don't want to go.

1137
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,940
So it doesn't really connect.

1138
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,940
I mean, there's a lot of people in the break.

1139
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:42,940
Yeah, I think it's not necessarily to do anything there.

1140
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,940
Yeah. And you'll write this.

1141
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:51,940
[INAUDIBLE]

1142
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:55,420
Yeah, yes, yes, absolutely.

1143
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:55,900
Yeah, OK.

1144
01:14:55,900 --> 01:15:00,900
So I mean, at first sight, you can do something

1145
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,100
because it's a kind of intuitive picture here,

1146
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:06,540
especially when you look at the front top of the hierarchy.

1147
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:11,260
So you find that New York and London is actually there.

1148
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,660
But then you quite quickly go into all kinds of anomalies.

1149
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:21,660
Yeah, these hub airports that are not necessarily relevant.

1150
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:25,620
There is destinations which tell us something about economic importance,

1151
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:30,300
but not necessarily about the importance in terms of controlling the global economy,

1152
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,900
which is kind of a different kind of process.

1153
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:40,660
Yeah, I was going to say something else about that, but it's, yeah, I forgot about it.

1154
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:45,420
Yeah, so we can also think about new data collections.

1155
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:49,540
And so your bitcoins is one brain.

1156
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,660
And I want to pick your brain a little bit more on that.

1157
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:55,580
But before that, I mean, just saying that one

1158
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:58,300
of the big struggles in the 1990s that research

1159
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,100
is where researchers work on front with.

1160
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,820
And this is still the case today.

1161
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:05,620
And you'll probably notice in some of your courses

1162
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:08,700
is that a lot of the statistics are collected

1163
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:11,260
at the state level and not necessarily

1164
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,020
at the urban level.

1165
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:17,260
And Peter Taylor, the by now emeritus professor

1166
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,500
that founded the globalization and multidisciplinary

1167
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,620
network always referred to this notion of state

1168
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,700
districts.

1169
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,500
It connected to statistics and indicators

1170
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,180
that were collected by the national state

1171
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:31,380
to measure the national economy, et cetera, et cetera.

1172
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,300
And at some point, the centrality of cities,

1173
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:38,940
in economic process, has only creeped in slightly.

1174
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:42,020
So we have sometimes at the national level

1175
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:46,860
indicate about cities, but then intercity connections

1176
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:48,060
and flows, it's very hard.

1177
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,540
Think about trade flows, for instance,

1178
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,020
(speaking in foreign language)

1179
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,940
It's between national economies,

1180
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:56,940
but if we have to assume them probably,

1181
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:00,140
the major metropolitan areas will be more tight

1182
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,660
in this growth and others.

1183
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,500
Yes.

1184
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,700
(mumbles)

1185
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,700
But the previous slide,

1186
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:07,220
in the beginning African-

1187
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:10,220
[INAUDIBLE]

1188
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,220
Sorry.

1189
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,220
Yeah.

1190
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:15,440
We have a lot of resource

1191
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,460
extraction happening in these places.

1192
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,940
No, but these--

1193
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,340
I mean, it's always a question.

1194
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,740
I will return to that.

1195
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,020
The power of representation.

1196
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:33,380
This is the result of where you cut off the list at some point.

1197
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,500
So it's the most connected places

1198
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,900
It's just a sense of passenger flows.

1199
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,900
But there's another realizer on upgrading that.

1200
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1201
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,700
Absolutely.

1202
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,700
How do you get the rear screw?

1203
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:49,300
Well, you can turn it around, and you can focus on Africa.

1204
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:53,660
African cities and how they're connected in global, global

1205
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,460
airline afterwards.

1206
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:58,500
So you can do some kind of if you will, but not the analysis.

1207
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,660
It's actually something that we did that look at the

1208
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:03,540
evolution of African cities globally.

1209
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:09,540
airline networks, and it could tell you, give you a hint about how these places are

1210
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:15,500
according to nationalizing globalizing through their airline networks, which you can then

1211
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,140
could still be a very rough figure.

1212
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:24,020
And it would also, as we found, capture all kinds of processes, the liberalization of the

1213
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:30,980
airline industry in Africa, rather than the increasing importance of some cities in the global

1214
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:36,940
So yeah, just to give you an idea of what is the trouble when you start looking for

1215
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:42,860
your kind of data, you perhaps can think a little bit about what other kinds of approximations

1216
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:43,860
you could use.

1217
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:50,500
And that was exactly kind of a conundrum or thing that people were chewing on in the 1990s

1218
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:57,300
and as it became evident at some kind of new metajography was needed.

1219
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:02,300
I'm using metagography in a sense that it refers to

1220
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,980
associate spatial structure, if you will,

1221
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,140
it helps to make sense of the world.

1222
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:12,140
So it's a geography that explains how processes work.

1223
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:16,860
Like the nation states tells us something

1224
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:17,960
about what extent

1225
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:24,540
either sectarian politics is able to territorialize,

1226
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:34,420
need to make it difficult. Whereas perhaps the world city network tries to capture the

1227
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:41,740
integrated fashion of economic processes. And this is actually what Manuel Castelles was

1228
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:47,580
writing about in the 1990s when we were talking about this space of flows which he put into

1229
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:53,980
opposition with the space of places. So he said, well, we have this traditional view of the world

1230
01:19:53,980 --> 01:20:01,180
as a mosaic of territorial states which are kind of yeah if you put them together you get the

1231
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:09,740
world map but there's another kind of geography that is out there which is discontinuous so it's

1232
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:15,260
kind of it's another continuous space these are kind of islands if you will that are connected

1233
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:23,820
to flows of goods, people, money, knowledge etc etc so this is kind of character

1234
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,580
rising the space of flow.

1235
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:28,560
And it's kind of, it's a socialization process,

1236
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,820
a sociologist.

1237
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:34,060
So it's a society emerging on that.

1238
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:38,460
And it was kind of kind of visionary.

1239
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,460
But I, he intended to be visionary in a sense

1240
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:42,980
that this would be the norm.

1241
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:45,900
So we would be the common network society.

1242
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,900
We can wonder about that.

1243
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,140
But what is kind of still relevant, I think,

1244
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:53,020
is that there's a tension between these spaces of flows.

1245
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:56,360
So these islands of connected urban areas,

1246
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:02,500
which is to some degree detached from a mosaic of city stance.

1247
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:06,060
And there's all kinds of oppositions between that.

1248
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,500
If you look at the election map in the UK,

1249
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,700
none of the election map, the referendum map.

1250
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:17,020
And you look at the leaf or remain float,

1251
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:20,980
it was clear that London wanted to stay in,

1252
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:23,620
which tells us something about the importance

1253
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,820
of being remaining connected to,

1254
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,420
we'd say other financial centers

1255
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,100
on the European continent.

1256
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,780
The rest of Britain, I mean, summarizing now,

1257
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:34,380
was against that,

1258
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,420
which shows that there's a disconnect in the daily lives

1259
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:41,700
of people to the interest of a city.

1260
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:46,700
I'm not saying that the leaf campaign

1261
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,060
actually connected to the real needs of Brits,

1262
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:50,700
but that's another kind of discussion, okay?

1263
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:54,380
So this space of flows served as a kind of new metagogy

1264
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:57,340
which then was an impetus to start collecting new data,

1265
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:02,340
which ultimately brings me to the raw curiosity

1266
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,940
and I'll try to be as brief as possible in the interest of time.

1267
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:09,100
It's also not something that you need to...

1268
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,660
No, you don't study this by heart,

1269
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:16,100
but it's a way to kind of appreciate a certain methodology.

1270
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:22,500
So just go to this website once, at least.

1271
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,740
It's hosted by Lovedra University in East England

1272
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:28,380
and then the Midlands.

1273
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:34,580
It's a very interesting source for urban level case studies

1274
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:37,620
on connectivity between cities.

1275
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,860
It can also use for other courses, I think,

1276
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:42,940
of the course by bus, for instance.

1277
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:46,500
So it's quite an inventory of nice case

1278
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,340
that is there.

1279
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:50,980
So what's the starting point of this, you can say,

1280
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:53,700
project by globalization and what's

1281
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:58,380
the research network was, is let's take APS firms

1282
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:05,340
as the clearest indicator species of this new space of flows.

1283
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,140
So there's a new space of flows that

1284
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:11,260
characterize how the global economy and global society works.

1285
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:15,300
And as we read Castell's Sosen, it's very likely

1286
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,260
that if we use these corporations,

1287
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:23,260
we'll be able to indicate a command and control functions

1288
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,100
of cities.

1289
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,700
So the starting point are the geographies of APS firms

1290
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:32,420
that tell us something about world and global cities.

1291
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,380
The reason is, as I explained earlier,

1292
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:37,220
these APS firms are in and of themselves.

1293
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:41,100
International players, they have a global city geography,

1294
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,820
if you will, so it makes sense to start looking

1295
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:53,500
And the idea is that you can actually build a model on the basis of these APS

1296
01:23:53,500 --> 01:24:00,620
geographies and the model is based on the co-presence, the shared presence of

1297
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:04,380
APS firms in multiple cities.

1298
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:09,740
Summarized is one firm in Brussels and London.

1299
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:14,220
It will make connection between these two cities and we can assume that it will

1300
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:21,180
will be so kind of flow of probably emails, telephone calls, ideas, there will be

1301
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:25,500
second-man's, people will travel between these officers, money will flow between

1302
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:31,720
these officers, etc. So the shared presence of APS firm in multiple cities, so

1303
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:36,860
one firm being located in multiple cities. So in a three-step spirit with any

1304
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:41,420
model you need to specify it, then you can measure it, it's filling it to a data,

1305
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:45,420
And then hopefully something comes out of this model.

1306
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,420
Okay?

1307
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:50,420
So, yeah, how does GOC solve it?

1308
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,420
So, just as a random example,

1309
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:56,420
a number of global or rural cities,

1310
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:59,420
New York, London, Brussels, Kuala Lumpur,

1311
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:05,420
and these are kind of contained spaces with a number of firms in there.

1312
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:08,420
And these are APS firms.

1313
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:11,500
And so there's the mobile, this thing, cities,

1314
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,660
and they host APS firms.

1315
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:16,420
Some of these firms are actually the same, okay?

1316
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:21,420
So we have by now transformed corporations

1317
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,460
such as Arthur Anderson, resident bank,

1318
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,860
Kiffin Chan, the law firm,

1319
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,220
Booth, Allen, Hamilton, noise,

1320
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,740
that's insurance company.

1321
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,940
But just to give you some questions.

1322
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:33,740
So how is it specified?

1323
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:34,740
What does God do?

1324
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,460
It says, well, oh, there's a firm here

1325
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:42,460
in London or Brussels, how important is this firm actually?

1326
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:46,180
Okay, so you try to measure this in an objective,

1327
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:49,020
or at least standardize way so that you make the same

1328
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:52,180
per every time, or that you write every time.

1329
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:55,980
So you say, okay, for this one office in Brussels

1330
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,700
by Barclays or something or HSBC, a bank,

1331
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,940
how important is it?

1332
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:03,420
And we use a very standard scale, zero to five,

1333
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:06,420
no offense are easy, you give it a zero.

1334
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:10,140
Oh, it's the global headquarters, that is a fine, okay?

1335
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:12,860
It's the only agency, but it would be, I don't know,

1336
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:16,980
KBC or something like that, large belting back, okay?

1337
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:19,580
And then there's a whole range in between.

1338
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,820
A typical office would be two,

1339
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:24,660
maybe a regional headquarters, and there's a lot of those

1340
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:28,760
and Brussels that actually control European activities

1341
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,340
would be a three or four.

1342
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:34,340
So this is kind of the idea.

1343
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:37,220
There's a hierarchy in office functions

1344
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:40,060
and we can measure this in a standardized way.

1345
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:43,260
If you have service values,

1346
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:48,060
you can also imagine what the importance of the connection

1347
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:50,740
between two offices would be.

1348
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:54,460
So a very important office and Brussels,

1349
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:56,980
and a very important office in London

1350
01:26:56,980 --> 01:27:01,500
would probably generate more traffic in terms of emails

1351
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,780
some phone calls, which is then again a proxy

1352
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:07,460
for, you could say, the importance of the activities

1353
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,180
in global command language.

1354
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:13,420
So it's basically calculating the intercity relation

1355
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:18,260
the R value there by multiplying the service values.

1356
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:21,260
And so very basic, so you have a very important time

1357
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:24,740
is a very important one, if you are very strong relation

1358
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,100
between these two places.

1359
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,100
OK.

1360
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:28,820
I'm going to get like that.

1361
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:29,860
Can I imagine the connection?

1362
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:33,580
So they took a line, the more important connection

1363
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,340
between these kind of offices.

1364
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:41,020
And you can populate a complete matrix with that.

1365
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:44,460
You can do that in the filter until you drop that,

1366
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,420
or you don't have the energy to look for more information

1367
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,700
on office networks.

1368
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,700
So this is kind of the basic one.

1369
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,620
And it allows you to do, for instance,

1370
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:57,620
this guy thinks that there's three cities in this very short list

1371
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,900
New York Singapore and the app work.

1372
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,920
And they have these different front

1373
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,140
and it gets from ABC and D.

1374
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:08,340
And we can could imagine a novel where you say, okay.

1375
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:13,340
And for a global office in New York,

1376
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:16,460
a very important office,

1377
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,300
or a regular office in Singapore,

1378
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:18,620
and a regular office in

1379
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:23,780
and it would be a bit different for BC and D.

1380
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:28,700
So just one example, I'll see there.

1381
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:34,460
What you can then do is start to measure the connectivity

1382
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:36,020
of cities.

1383
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:40,700
Thus far we've been talking about first

1384
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:43,940
and what the importance of the city has for a firm.

1385
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:46,100
You can also think about what is now

1386
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:49,820
the strength of a city's connection based

1387
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:52,260
on the presence of first.

1388
01:28:52,260 --> 01:29:00,100
What you do is you basically summarize all these different types between cities for one

1389
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,100
one six.

1390
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:04,020
It sounds a bit complex but it's really easy.

1391
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:10,780
So what you would do is think about the connection between different cities on the base

1392
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:11,940
of the corporate networks.

1393
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:19,060
So think about five times two plus five times two would be the connectivity generated

1394
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:22,260
by first-grown, so you can be four times two.

1395
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:25,740
Your, you'll be five times one.

1396
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:29,460
And in this step, I think I was five.

1397
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:33,460
And in some, you would get a figure of 40.

1398
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,740
It's purely irrelevant example,

1399
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:38,580
but it would give you the highest connectivity

1400
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:41,300
in this model, right?

1401
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:42,820
And then for the other kind of cities,

1402
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:44,900
we could do similar exercises,

1403
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,320
and for it would be generating

1404
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:53,000
activities for a and even just a low presence on its front. But you would generate

1405
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,960
someone activity for eight and for a. And also summarize that. And what you could

1406
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:04,520
also do is express this as a proportion of most connected city in this tiny

1407
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:10,200
example of New York. And you would get to say, well, enter is four times

1408
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:15,400
connected as well as New York. So New York is is our leading

1409
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:19,320
We'll sit here, then we have Singapore and then Andrew.

1410
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:25,160
So a very, very small example to tell you how the structure is.

1411
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:29,240
Service values, thinking about connections between cities,

1412
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,960
and then summarizing these connections.

1413
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:36,600
And that gives us an overall view of the connectivity of the city in the world,

1414
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,720
sitting there.

1415
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,920
So we have specified the model.

1416
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:47,920
And then you can start measuring it and filling it with data.

1417
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:52,080
And how has GOC done this?

1418
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:56,320
Well, specification obviously refers to the APS firms.

1419
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:01,200
And this kind of nice is that this measurement

1420
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,480
has occurred several times since, I think, 2,000,

1421
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,080
but every time in the same way.

1422
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,840
So it kind of definitions of categories

1423
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,120
of these kind of APS sectors has been in the same,

1424
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,840
and has been numerous kind of reiterations

1425
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,680
of these measures.

1426
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:21,040
So five sectors are connected to SELSA's interpretation.

1427
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,520
Can't see advertising, financial services, insurance,

1428
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,840
law, management, and so forth.

1429
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:31,840
Basically, what God does is the leading firms, 175 firms,

1430
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:38,360
based on Forbes and other kinds of corporate lists,

1431
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:44,040
that tells something about turnover, the size of these folks, et cetera, et cetera, are

1432
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:47,280
kind of selected.

1433
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:53,760
And then what is also done is, yeah, you could do this with an infinite number of cities.

1434
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,880
Well, not infinite, but a very large list of cities.

1435
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:03,600
But to avoid a bit of, I don't know, it's not biased, but to get a manageable data set,

1436
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:08,940
You could say the largest cities or what we know from certain countries as economically

1437
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,440
and important cities are selected in this list.

1438
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:15,360
So it's not a purely inductive exercise.

1439
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:20,120
It's kind of an informed decision to include some cities and other products.

1440
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:27,840
So all the firms, a lot of cities, and then on the basis of information that we can find

1441
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:36,000
on corporate websites, we made a decision as to how important offices are. And then you

1442
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:44,880
can basically start filling the entire matrix. So just an example to share how this works.

1443
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:49,680
I mean, you think about just look at the website, can be quite tough, but you can actually

1444
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:56,720
hold all of these websites, find very detailed information at the address level of these

1445
01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:01,360
offices and all of these corporations are very proud that they're located in the

1446
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:08,480
meeting world city is kind of a brand new so quite often you can fly down yes

1447
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:15,840
yes you avoid the deforestation that's a very good idea

1448
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:22,560
I think yeah I'm not sure whether it's going to take away all the noise that

1449
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:30,640
that's what you're internet. So yeah, so it's a really accessible source of information,

1450
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:38,880
but obviously it's also a bit of a guesswork and you need to come up with some kind of

1451
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:46,800
interpretive guide to meet these websites and to make decisions as to how you will

1452
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:55,440
give attached value to these phrases. Okay, just one, and then you can build these kind of

1453
01:33:55,440 --> 01:34:03,040
matrices. So all of them are all of countries, a lot of cities. And then you can start applying

1454
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:08,400
that problem. Okay, so it's an approximation of the importance of cities in these corporate networks,

1455
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:15,760
and it has the level of kind of sustained analysis or modeling of these interactions on that

1456
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:24,640
basis. And then maybe already have seen these kind of maps. So a lot of world-saving network research

1457
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:30,800
then start to look into the actual geographies that are being produced. So this is some research

1458
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:40,560
from a while ago. It just shows the absolute levels of connectivity, so the global network connectivity,

1459
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:48,320
and the darker pieces are the most connected places and then the lower the light colors by the

1460
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:55,760
less one place. So it gives you an idea. Take a good look at this map. What you learn from that

1461
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:09,760
or what you find striking anything striking here. Does it confirm what you thought? You learned

1462
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:38,760
Can you think? Yeah? No? Yes? I don't really get a comment on the situation. I said, "If I do this, or if you do this, the word happens. There are not a few routines in this." So, where there's so many neuroships. If you think that you said that you can kind of think of the largest in these things, you do a piece of permanent largest in the number of populations.

1463
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:39,760
I know.

1464
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,760
No.

1465
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:43,640
So, but it's a list.

1466
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,480
So there's a number of criteria.

1467
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:51,040
I mean, population is one, but it's also in certain countries.

1468
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:56,440
I mean, it's also looking for its business, its written down economic importance.

1469
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:04,920
So in Belgium, it would also include these entities, which is absolutely not a two million

1470
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:09,280
in happen in the city so but we know it has important opportunities.

1471
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:13,640
Now just to be clear, these are not 525 cities,

1472
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,160
but it's a selection I think it's 123.

1473
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:20,160
So it's focusing on the most important cities,

1474
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:24,560
which as a result, apparently gifts,

1475
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,400
a geography that is skewed towards,

1476
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,840
it's a Northern America Western Europe

1477
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,440
and then has a bit of presence elsewhere.

1478
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:45,440
>> Yeah. >> I'm just thinking, like, this thing is like, about 50, just, yeah, I think, like, it's like that.

1479
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:50,440
Like, it's like a whole life, like, you know, in relationship that a global that type of business.

1480
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,440
Like, I don't know if you have a good case. >> Yeah, absolutely.

1481
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:55,440
>> You know, that's a good case. >> For making sense, you know, which I found in a bit,

1482
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,440
a lot lower probably not, but the money, but like, how many people, you know,

1483
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:07,640
>> I agree 300%.

1484
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:13,680
So the question is, does this represent cities and globalization or does it represent

1485
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:17,280
the location strategies of APS first?

1486
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,080
And to what extent is this the same?

1487
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:24,400
So the question is to what extent do you go along and

1488
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:30,480
claim that it gets from foreign indicators species of commandment control. I think to some extent

1489
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:35,520
this is the case but there's clearly other processes but I think and that's something that we'll

1490
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:43,120
return to later on. We have to I think another key distinguish between say more economic drug

1491
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:48,720
a few readings whereas there's also more urban studies critiques some people say that you're not

1492
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:53,600
capturing globalization here. And this whole process we should look at?

1493
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:58,480
Yes, that's true. But it doesn't discredit one particular reading or one particular focus on the

1494
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:03,520
process, as long as we're clear about what it is that measures and what it is it has. But I

1495
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:09,440
completely example that remitances, I'll return to that in a second, is very appropriate.

1496
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:16,080
So this we have to be careful that we were not switched to some kind of imperial

1497
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,560
act here to try to claim that one process dominates something, but it was a specific

1498
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:33,680
equation. Same here is the same period that's a kind of comparison between two periods in time.

1499
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:40,240
I mean there was a data collection that allows analysis in 2000 and I'm just before the crisis

1500
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:45,120
in 2008, I mean the previous crisis, we get them all.

1501
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:50,120
So comparing the structure of the world city network,

1502
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:52,620
which is effectively on the aggregate level,

1503
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:58,620
the structure of corporate strategies and the interpretive fees.

1504
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:02,620
And I mean it's kind of interesting to see that even before

1505
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:06,020
the Euro-American or North Atlantic financial crisis,

1506
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:09,920
there was already a shift going on in terms of strategic importance

1507
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:14,020
of cities in the east, and I mean both in eastern Europe,

1508
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:18,620
and the global east, so I'm talking about Chinese cities,

1509
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:23,420
for instance, so if regions were interested in secular shifts

1510
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:25,940
within the structure of the world economy,

1511
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:29,980
it shows that it's also reflected in the corporate geographies

1512
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:34,220
of these ATS firms, which knowing that they're

1513
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:37,260
important inputs for global corporations

1514
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:40,300
There's something about developments on these cities

1515
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:44,060
in how capital circulates on the global scale.

1516
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,860
So it tells us something that everything,

1517
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:52,180
and that's also why Rob uses heuristic.

1518
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,780
And there's some modesty connected to that.

1519
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,740
Heuristic is a kind of a starting point.

1520
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:59,300
As a searching device, where he's like,

1521
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:04,300
oh, what the hell is going on in, let's say, lightly?

1522
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:06,900
It's dark reds.

1523
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,380
What could be the process going on?

1524
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:12,020
How does it explain that-- how do you explain that it's

1525
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:15,100
one of the worst performers, if you will,

1526
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:16,740
and it was so much connectivity,

1527
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:18,820
whereas it's a very important transit

1528
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:23,820
hub between that in America and a northern America?

1529
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:26,900
Is why is it losing its functions?

1530
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:29,380
Is it because Latin America is becoming

1531
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:35,060
less important for northern American capital?

1532
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:36,100
what could be going on there?

1533
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:39,940
I mean, you can think about numerous other examples there.

1534
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,460
And it should be, I think, and that's

1535
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:44,780
how I personally use it, the starting point for analysis.

1536
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:48,020
And a difference set to a different set of methods.

1537
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:50,660
You could do a case study, follow the thing,

1538
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:53,340
follow your nose, and try to problematize

1539
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,420
these kinds of findings.

1540
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:58,420
But it's a way to refer to her back to that.

1541
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:00,900
And it gives you-- that's, I think, he added value,

1542
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,780
some kind of standardized overview.

1543
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:12,860
There's a lot of things that we can say about that. I really need to press on because

1544
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:17,300
it's taking a bit more time than expected. Are you still okay to proceed? I promise that

1545
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:22,860
we won't take 25 minutes but maybe 20 minutes if I'm lucky?

1546
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:28,460
Is that okay or do you want to break? Why is this going to be there?

1547
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:35,660
Yes you can. Yeah, is there a collective need for a restroom break?

1548
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:44,460
Is that a yes hand? Yeah, two minutes because we really because we can't take too much time.

1549
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:51,460

[BLANK_AUDIO]

1598
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,940
Please thank your seats.

1599
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:20,940
[BLANK_AUDIO]

1600
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:27,940
Yeah.

1601
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:37,980
So yeah, this one's in that view of breach should appreciate by now a long tradition of

1602
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:42,300
rural and global cities research, then this kind of severity informed the general by

1603
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,300
core.

1604
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:49,020
But at some point, and especially the early technologies, there was a danger that, or at

1605
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:54,260
least this recent agenda was, was in terms of this, you could say dominant or hedge

1606
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:58,420
of monitoring the wind in urban studies or for citizens in global

1607
01:48:58,420 --> 01:49:05,860
ization. And as such, it's also raised quite a bit of criticism. And I think it's debatable

1608
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:10,100
to what extent this is just quite some points of this. Certainly as other points, I think

1609
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:15,620
I'm personally, but I'm also kind of involved in these debates a bit more in the wild.

1610
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:20,500
I'll just take you through them. And I hope to do so within the next 20 minutes.

1611
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:28,180
Right, I think we can say, I still think that the aristarch can be powerful to the map and

1612
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:34,260
spatially analyze global connections, but clearly something can be said that. I'll just skip that

1613
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:40,580
and cut the business. One of the most important things and most French and critiques

1614
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:48,340
I think it was Lawrence, I think the beginning of the notice by a famous scholar Jennifer Robinson,

1615
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:59,620
South African working from London, wrote a book, Ordinary Cities. However, papers was

1616
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:04,580
World Cities or a World of Cities where she kind of

1617
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:12,260
was with frustrated with this dominance of world cities research

1618
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:14,780
in the debate about city city globalization.

1619
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:17,660
And it says, and she says, well, it's quite a different thing

1620
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:21,100
about world cities for the globalization of cities more

1621
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:22,580
wide.

1622
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:25,820
And that's good reasons for this difference,

1623
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:29,220
or the lack of what world and global cities

1624
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:30,020
research was doing.

1625
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:33,020
Then in addressing cities in globalization,

1626
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:38,020
Since I've seen the map, a lot of the cities around the globe,

1627
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:39,580
and especially in the global south,

1628
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:44,340
are basically dropped off a physical, natural map, right?

1629
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:48,060
So we find that there's a lot of connectivity

1630
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:50,700
in your Western Western European,

1631
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:52,820
or the American Asian cities,

1632
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:55,220
but it's actually very little to be told

1633
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:59,420
about African cities that basically not represent the environment.

1634
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:02,380
So an issue of representation there,

1635
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:11,500
in her view, but it also deals with how we conceptualize world and world cities.

1636
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:18,140
And in her argument, we focused too much on a limited number of economic processes,

1637
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:21,780
whereas all the kinds of connections remain unsteaded.

1638
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:26,660
One of the examples that was already given was, yeah, you can look at remittances,

1639
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:30,620
and you would get a completely different view, perhaps,

1640
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:34,100
on these carbon networks.

1641
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:38,500
So how kind of claim is that, by doing so,

1642
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:42,140
by these, say, geographical and sexual biases,

1643
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:43,620
well, cities of search has ignored

1644
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:45,700
the wrong position of numerous ordinary cities

1645
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:46,980
in the global economy.

1646
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:52,140
And there's a tendency to, you could say, offer

1647
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:54,860
a Eurocentric global city theory,

1648
01:51:54,860 --> 01:51:58,980
and then projecting that other areas of the world.

1649
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:02,100
So, a postcolonial critique,

1650
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,380
it's concerned with, you can say,

1651
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:09,380
power relations in the production of theories and concepts.

1652
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:14,620
And how these concepts and theories are reproducing

1653
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:17,300
existing inequalities.

1654
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:19,820
And these are also geographical,

1655
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:23,740
so it's social, spatial, and even as the global scale.

1656
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:27,540
If we keep on kind of reiterating the dominance

1657
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:31,220
of certain kinds of activities, come up with certain kind

1658
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:34,500
of maps, measuring things in a certain way,

1659
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:37,980
in the anthropod of the process and part of the body,

1660
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:39,740
if you will.

1661
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:44,140
So I think there's certainly an argument to be made there.

1662
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:48,100
I think representation is problematic in my own research

1663
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:50,460
that was also kind of the starting point

1664
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:51,820
of why it was interested in looking

1665
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:56,820
into Islamic finance as a way to understand Middle Eastern.

1666
01:52:56,820 --> 01:53:02,500
World's deformation process is not to a traditional lens

1667
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:05,700
of the classic APS firms, but to look at, okay,

1668
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:09,420
to what extent or local norms and ethics,

1669
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:12,120
religious and other regarding finance,

1670
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:18,300
giving rise to a global sector in an overt zone,

1671
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,180
that could then also start,

1672
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:22,660
So I was in the back interurban connections.

1673
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:27,380
That was kind of what I did in my own work on Islamic finance.

1674
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:31,780
So I certainly am extremely sensitive to this autumn.

1675
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:35,260
But at the same time, we also have to be clear

1676
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:39,420
that part of this criticism perhaps also out of place.

1677
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:42,980
I think Jennifer Robinson really starts from an urban studies

1678
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:46,780
critique, which you also understand.

1679
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:49,300
You can say globalization and its plurality,

1680
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:53,220
not just economic but otherwise and even within economic processes,

1681
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:56,780
or why diversity, rests for God.

1682
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:59,500
I think that the purposes, how can we understand

1683
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,300
the reproduction of uneven development

1684
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:05,740
on a global scale, at least in the free-to-manion tradition,

1685
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:10,020
where it was about how can we explain the fact

1686
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:13,300
that there's still under development

1687
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:17,540
and on the rate that the Frank serves in the global south,

1688
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:19,460
does it have something to do with the support

1689
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:23,940
and position of these cities in macro processes,

1690
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:26,020
macro capitalist process?

1691
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:30,780
So is it something with the extraction of value,

1692
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:32,780
organized through these corporate networks

1693
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:36,060
and supported by these previous firms that actually explains

1694
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:38,100
why these cities are not on the map?

1695
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,700
So is this a result?

1696
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:43,780
Is this not a neglect of these places?

1697
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:46,420
The fact that these places are not represented means

1698
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:50,020
either bypassed by these core protectors

1699
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:53,740
or that they potentially are subordinate in those process.

1700
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:56,780
Which could then be a question of, is this really case?

1701
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:59,620
Can we look into these processes?

1702
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:02,900
So sometimes a bit of a confusion, I think,

1703
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:05,420
between kind of a deliberate choice,

1704
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,620
not only include certain places

1705
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:09,860
whereas some of these maps are actually to be taken

1706
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:12,860
as a result of a critical analysis.

1707
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:17,060
I do agree that in a number of,

1708
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:20,060
You could say analysis that are more technical in nature,

1709
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:22,580
in terms of the world city network,

1710
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:25,620
this kind of critical edge was sometimes lost.

1711
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:29,460
And there's a kind of mission drift towards mapping networks,

1712
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:31,740
whereas the connection to process of uneven development

1713
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:32,980
was less clear,

1714
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:36,460
it's a bit of my personal crusade

1715
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:41,140
to make the connection to the critical agenda again.

1716
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:42,700
So this, but certainly,

1717
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:46,940
Jennifer Robinson points us to be very clear

1718
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:49,940
clear about what it is that we are measuring

1719
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:52,660
to this kind of growth analysis and what we're not.

1720
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:55,580
So it's about placing them at these kind of methods

1721
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:58,460
in a wider, you can say,

1722
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:02,940
a firmament of methods to work with that.

1723
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:07,660
Now, with this also connect to what kind of practice

1724
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:10,900
we wish to endorse within the tradition

1725
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:14,420
of urban studies, in the sense that,

1726
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:19,420
And this is kind of our personal disappointment

1727
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:23,420
with a lot of research that has followed the work

1728
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:26,420
by Jennifer Robinson, the version for Amazon itself.

1729
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:30,300
But there's a lot of tendency with we're which Jennifer or Jenny.

1730
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:35,020
And a very reductionist representation

1731
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:36,660
of her legitimate claims.

1732
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:39,460
And we actually wrote a paper about this

1733
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:41,420
with these religious title,

1734
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:48,420
to kind of throw that and speak, where we kind of deal with distilling what is kind of

1735
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:52,380
justified criticism and where we think it's a bit too much.

1736
01:56:52,380 --> 01:57:00,300
And what we particularly regret is that some of the criticism has led to disengaged or

1737
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:06,700
a plumberism where it's a kind of rejection, so in the genus to do something else without

1738
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:10,260
taking stock about of the knowledge that is produced here.

1739
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:16,260
So what we try to then propose is some kind of a middle ground is a more engaged form

1740
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:21,880
of urban studies debate, which also means that you say yes, these kind of global white

1741
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:24,280
analysis or well-setty research.

1742
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:29,340
In general, we need to put it in its place, but it doesn't mean that we can try to work

1743
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:35,260
at this concept to make sense of places beyond the short list of world cities.

1744
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:42,260
It would be that I'm battling and I'm defending and explaining myself in different kind of race and unnecessary race.

1745
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:45,260
But let me try to make it work clear.

1746
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:47,260
Because they are very rude.

1747
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:51,260
Manila. We don't need world safety concepts.

1748
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:55,260
The world city is a Euro mountain invention.

1749
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:57,260
I can't do anything with that.

1750
01:57:57,260 --> 01:58:00,260
It could be something that you could say.

1751
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:06,740
We need a conflict of the Middle Eastern city of the Asian city because everything is particular

1752
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:13,100
and then we need to build that theory and then it's so unique in particular that you can't land.

1753
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:23,460
So people disagree and say, look, there's no one-on-one projection of world city formation as a process

1754
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:27,220
on a city like the Hudefur instance or Manila.

1755
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:33,140
But we'll have to work with the concept to see to what extent it does explain something

1756
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:35,740
of what we find and what extent it doesn't.

1757
01:58:35,740 --> 01:58:44,180
And perhaps we need to enhance or tailor that first find the concept.

1758
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:49,740
And in the process, we potentially may even learn something about the place that we study.

1759
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:55,300
But at least we still remain in the position that we can speak back to the original debate,

1760
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:57,360
which is I think the point of urban studies

1761
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:58,840
that were not lost in translation,

1762
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:02,940
will try to connect with some kind of organ eye

1763
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:04,540
or overarching debate,

1764
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:07,280
even if you're studying very diverse places.

1765
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:11,340
- Now, yeah, I won't say too much about this two cases

1766
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:13,880
because it's also part of our discussion seminar,

1767
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:17,740
but just to point out the kind of contrasting cases.

1768
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:19,660
So in one paper we looked at the LUTs,

1769
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:22,620
which is kind of interesting place.

1770
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:25,700
we put a more by exact,

1771
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:28,580
that role-to-information process.

1772
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:34,300
So what you see is a built environment with skyscrapers.

1773
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:39,940
They obviously took a hit and are taking a serious hit currently

1774
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:43,780
with the entire term of the country, isn't.

1775
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:46,180
But on the first side, say, OK,

1776
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:49,540
there's actually, when you start looking at APS activities,

1777
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:51,620
it's actually very little going on there.

1778
01:59:51,620 --> 01:59:56,980
There's a lot of very little regional headquarters, the ferry there were international firms.

1779
01:59:56,980 --> 02:00:07,700
But when you then start looking into yes remittance flows and the Aspara, you find that almost one-fifth of Lebanese economy is made of these remittances.

1780
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:19,540
And a lot of it faces that, to a BS professionals, that are located in the Gulf so it's our McKinsey trained, but agreed consultants, McKinsey's living,

1781
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:23,940
that is them advising the Saudis or people in Dubai, the elite leader of Dubai,

1782
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:31,460
that earn their money there, send back their money and buy a hugely overpriced apartment

1783
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:36,980
in the city centre of the Greenhouse. The real estate market which is then

1784
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:42,500
kept artificially booming by almost free credit from the central bank of Lebanon,

1785
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:48,420
which is also the personal property of the living families of Lebanon.

1786
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:51,700
So it's kind of connected.

1787
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:55,860
Now in any case, it shows you that if you follow your nose,

1788
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:58,860
in a sense, there's still awesome characteristics

1789
02:00:58,860 --> 02:01:02,420
of world to deformation, especially in the role

1790
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:04,340
of a high-skilled labor.

1791
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:05,860
But it's a kind of--

1792
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:09,500
it's in some of the parts of regional capacity building,

1793
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:13,860
regional circuits of failure that are kind of connected

1794
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:15,660
back to the city.

1795
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:20,940
So it's function as a capital sink to the region,

1796
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:24,620
rather than as a kind of server service in the liveries.

1797
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:27,180
If you look at Manila, it's kind of the opposite.

1798
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:29,620
You'd say, wow, a lot of activities there,

1799
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:32,300
a lot of APS firms, they're all there.

1800
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:35,220
But then you suddenly into these activities,

1801
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:36,260
and there's something that you know,

1802
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:38,300
a collaborative has done.

1803
02:01:38,300 --> 02:01:41,540
It's basically part of the largest one of the largest

1804
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:45,220
outsourcing sectors of tendencies that you find.

1805
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:47,820
So a lot of back office activities,

1806
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:50,940
for global banks and other kind of service providers,

1807
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:54,180
but it's not really come up in control,

1808
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:56,580
or not at least not what we think of it.

1809
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:59,500
And it may also work through

1810
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:02,740
and what it can explain in terms of the segmentation

1811
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:03,580
of the labor market,

1812
02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:06,860
but because it would not be high-end managers

1813
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:09,100
that are then gentrifying neighborhoods,

1814
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:12,700
but it may arise through middle-class or something.

1815
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:17,100
So it may result in other kinds of labor market structures.

1816
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:20,020
But at least we can still refer back to world cities

1817
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:22,380
and start comparing to what is going on elsewhere.

1818
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:25,380
So this is an example of an encompassing approach

1819
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:29,820
to try to encompass diversity in your research design

1820
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:31,740
and try to make sense.

1821
02:02:31,740 --> 02:02:32,700
So that's how we solve it.

1822
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:34,380
I won't say anything more because I want

1823
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:38,860
to leave something for the debating session.

1824
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:45,860
The second point of criticism is social constructivity.

1825
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:50,900
Again, it's the same in the sense that representation matters.

1826
02:02:50,900 --> 02:02:55,740
And this is the great work by Dory Massey,

1827
02:02:55,740 --> 02:03:05,500
who was a transatlantic nice economic juggler for from the UK,

1828
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:07,260
thought about spatial divisions of labor

1829
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:11,660
was one of the leading voices in a lot of progressive debates

1830
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:14,460
in geography.

1831
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:18,700
And she also wrote a book, "World City in 2007,

1832
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:23,740
I wish kind of engaged with this agenda."

1833
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:31,460
And what she basically says in this book is, yeah,

1834
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:36,300
world cities are not just a given, an economic geographical

1835
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:40,260
reality based on, as we said, the clustering

1836
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:44,540
on these ABS firms, their labor markets, et cetera, et cetera.

1837
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:50,280
They are, but they're also a product of discourses,

1838
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:52,520
representation, et cetera, et cetera.

1839
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:58,660
So they're mediated by political interests, elites,

1840
02:03:58,660 --> 02:04:03,820
others, and other actors that project certain discourses

1841
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:10,380
about world and global cities and these also have ultimately performative effects.

1842
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:14,060
So they produce or go produce certain realities.

1843
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:17,060
It's a bit kind of knowledge theory.

1844
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:23,340
So the world is also to some extent shaped by how you represent this.

1845
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:28,460
And then you can be an ardent, very strong believer of that and say, okay, the world is

1846
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:30,020
almost exclusively,

1847
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:32,140
reducible to how we represented

1848
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:33,940
whereas others would work more in

1849
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:35,260
kind of materialist fragrance,

1850
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:37,580
okay, not everything is shaped by words, right?

1851
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:41,340
So I think I'm gonna look at the other,

1852
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:43,540
it's kind of something to think about

1853
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:46,580
toward extent, representation actually matters.

1854
02:04:46,580 --> 02:04:51,060
Now, Jourine explains this for London,

1855
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:53,860
and she says, yes, it's a globalized financial center,

1856
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:55,140
but the way you perceive it

1857
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:56,980
and the way the city reproduces itself

1858
02:04:56,980 --> 02:05:01,700
is the outcome of a decade-long battle of representation,

1859
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:04,860
which was led by government finance elites, politicians,

1860
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:10,300
not often not seldomly connected to all boys' networks

1861
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:13,820
that have been projecting the world city status of London.

1862
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:17,500
And this has become some kind of a hedge in life.

1863
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:21,940
Unquestioned, near-liberal growth strategy,

1864
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:26,340
has been part of that new liberal strategy since the eight.

1865
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:31,940
And the kind of ideas that what is good for the financial industry is good for the city.

1866
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:35,740
What's good for the city is good for London, what's good for London, what's good for the Saudis,

1867
02:05:35,740 --> 02:05:39,740
what is good for the Saudis is good for UK.

1868
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:48,340
And dear Europeans, what is good for the UK is also good for Europe, so please deregulate the Afghans.

1869
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:57,940
So it's a rhetorical strategy she calls the passport total where the part is there to represent the whole.

1870
02:05:57,940 --> 02:06:04,540
So it's the interest of the city of London which are projected to be the interest of the UK citizen.

1871
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:11,540
And again, as Brexit has shown, this has been quite radically rejected.

1872
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:16,940
Again, whether legitimately or not.

1873
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:23,960
So, yeah, there's this neoliberal growth strategy, and it also was connected to legitimate

1874
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:26,460
legitimate material decisions.

1875
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:32,100
In the sense that, if you look at this course, it's about dust, heat, growth, you need

1876
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,420
a new runway because of capacity issues.

1877
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:36,420
Yes.

1878
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:42,540
London cannot keep up with its global safety status or it cannot grow its connection to

1879
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:46,500
new emerging markets if it doesn't have an extra runway.

1880
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:53,500
So please, papers go away or needle your ears.

1881
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:57,100
But we absolutely need this.

1882
02:06:57,100 --> 02:07:00,620
And in global city discourse is there to justify it.

1883
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:02,700
But also when you look at the construction of the UK,

1884
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:07,500
colony in the '80s, I mean, closing the mines, et cetera,

1885
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:07,780
et cetera.

1886
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:11,340
And this has produced very uneven outcomes in the UK.

1887
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:13,780
A lot of cities in the north and opening

1888
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:15,580
mining areas in the industrial areas.

1889
02:07:15,580 --> 02:07:17,100
So decline.

1890
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:19,820
And at that point, what would have been interesting

1891
02:07:19,820 --> 02:07:24,260
is low interest rates, that could boost investment

1892
02:07:24,260 --> 02:07:27,380
to restructure these peripheral economies.

1893
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:28,220
That didn't happen.

1894
02:07:28,220 --> 02:07:30,540
And at that point, there was an inflation,

1895
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:33,620
there was high interest rates, which made,

1896
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:35,780
but simply money very expensive.

1897
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:39,540
And which made that it was very hard

1898
02:07:39,540 --> 02:07:41,580
to seek investment into these areas.

1899
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:43,820
And obviously, there was only interest of the Southeast,

1900
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:47,140
which generate an influence into financial services,

1901
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:52,140
et cetera, which then further grew global city London.

1902
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:54,940
So it's a particular political agenda

1903
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:58,420
that is behind there that has produced there.

1904
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:02,220
There are final points that we as academics

1905
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:06,420
or academics to be are not neutral bystanders

1906
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:08,860
and her claim is that especially when you start looking

1907
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:12,780
at these world city rankings that GOC

1908
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:14,780
is claimed to produce.

1909
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:16,060
This is part of the problem.

1910
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:19,580
It's kind of fueling the self-fuling prophecy

1911
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:23,700
as giving people in the city of Roman.

1912
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:25,500
The instruments that they exhibit to say,

1913
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:29,100
look, we're still leading city parts

1914
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:30,420
Dubai is closing.

1915
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:31,540
Please, come on.

1916
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:34,140
We need further investment in the city

1917
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:37,820
or we need the regulation or something like that.

1918
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:40,140
So that's kind of her also attention-preteaken

1919
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:47,140
in a sense that yes, world cities research is performative in that sense.

1920
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:52,140
So yeah, just a few slides there, and I'll return to that.

1921
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:58,620
I mean, the pictures that we have of representations that we have of London are the

1922
02:08:58,620 --> 02:09:03,340
glitz and glam quite often, and it's typically the city.

1923
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:08,140
But then how city is kept, the city of London is kept working on the wider metropolitan

1924
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:10,700
and how it remains often undiscovered

1925
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:13,380
or something that we'll talk about next week.

1926
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:18,380
- Yeah, and this is kind of battle of representation

1927
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:20,660
is ongoing, this is a bit of a data figure

1928
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:24,580
and still with Theresa May there

1929
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:28,020
who was going for a global Britain agenda.

1930
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:33,020
And again, you see that this kind of city elite

1931
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:36,740
is trying to push it in the whole campaign

1932
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:41,740
in a certain way, threatening to leave the city of London,

1933
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:45,300
which would then impact, you could say,

1934
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:49,180
the global city status of that city.

1935
02:09:49,180 --> 02:09:51,860
So it's kind of still the same repertoire

1936
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:56,860
that has been used at times when Brexit was still

1937
02:09:56,860 --> 02:10:01,660
unfinished business, probably not still not unfinished

1938
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:04,180
business, but for that.

1939
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:07,500
Now, I think, and then I really almost have the close

1940
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:10,420
performativity is a very important criticism.

1941
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:12,860
It's something that we should be very reflexive about.

1942
02:10:12,860 --> 02:10:16,220
It basically means the influence that it

1943
02:10:16,220 --> 02:10:19,060
reduce kind of figures that you could use the maps

1944
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:20,580
that you produced or what they spend

1945
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:22,620
to their shape and impact.

1946
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:24,940
Theality to what extent are they picked up?

1947
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:27,540
What is the responsibility of a researcher

1948
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:32,580
to keep ownership over his or her results?

1949
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:35,260
do we have an impact on that?

1950
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:37,460
And it's something that is also very important

1951
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:41,580
to reflect on in relation to world cities and global cities.

1952
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:44,900
And there I think my personal stance is that we should

1953
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:49,140
probably not exaggerate the influence of world

1954
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:51,100
and global cities research in the sense

1955
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:55,100
that it's only part of a much wider phenomenon

1956
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:58,260
of city rankings, et cetera, et cetera.

1957
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:00,260
And as you will start looking at it,

1958
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:05,100
It's often behaviors from themselves that come up with all kinds of rankings and they're

1959
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:13,580
much more picked up in popular debates, but for politicians that once again, a world in

1960
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:19,820
global cities status, provided and referring to GOG in and of itself.

1961
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:24,100
I mean, it would be a pleasure to actually know that people would meet economic papers,

1962
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:26,620
but I think it's actually quite limited.

1963
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:29,880
So yes, we need to be reflexive about them at the same time.

1964
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:32,180
It could give me a little bit overblown.

1965
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:35,860
And rankings are produced probably by other factors.

1966
02:11:35,860 --> 02:11:41,140
I'm sorry to run through this.

1967
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:42,540
Another point is--

1968
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:51,380
this is a criticism that deals with, to what extent,

1969
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:53,580
world and global cities takes into account,

1970
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:57,620
because of political economy processes,

1971
02:11:57,620 --> 02:12:00,460
or the politics of global city formation,

1972
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:05,100
I think that connects to the work of Dorian Massey.

1973
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:08,580
And it's kind of an agenda that was pushed

1974
02:12:08,580 --> 02:12:12,660
by new Brenner, especially at the end of the 1990s.

1975
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:15,140
And he says, well, it's not just economic geographies,

1976
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:18,700
it's not just agglomerations, clusters, et cetera, et cetera.

1977
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:20,900
What we need to account for is the restructuring

1978
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:27,500
of the economy and what he says, a rescaling of the nation state.

1979
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:31,100
So the way capitalism is being governed

1980
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:34,580
is not exclusively at the national scale,

1981
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:36,620
but something is happening at the same time

1982
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:38,220
it's becoming super national.

1983
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:40,700
So you get a whole kind of international organizations,

1984
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:43,180
IMF, OECD, et cetera, et cetera.

1985
02:12:43,180 --> 02:12:45,220
And Europe, Europe being union that starts

1986
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:49,420
to increasingly govern the economy.

1987
02:12:49,420 --> 02:12:53,080
And at the same time, there's a kind of devolution,

1988
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:56,340
growth in the importance of regions, of cities,

1989
02:12:56,340 --> 02:13:00,140
as governance layers, and some kind of a hollowing out

1990
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:01,780
of the national level.

1991
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:04,340
So in the words of new Breneary talks

1992
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:07,220
about globalization, as the undoing of the state,

1993
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:09,700
will that be because the re-spatialization

1994
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:12,460
or re-territory realization of the state,

1995
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:15,020
where it attaches itself to new spatial layers.

1996
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:18,300
And it calls these new state spaces

1997
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:22,300
to which you have new kinds of new state projects.

1998
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:23,100
The road project.

1999
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:27,060
So to summarize that seems a bit complex,

2000
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:31,180
but there's a shift in how national economies are

2001
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:34,180
being managed in terms of spatial scales.

2002
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:36,620
It's also happening a much more entrepreneurial way.

2003
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:40,620
And I'll say more about that next week.

2004
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:44,140
But the point is that these are politically negotiated

2005
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:50,140
process. And you can have a look at this overview slides to the kind of detailed

2006
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:56,940
process that are going on there. But just to give one example, they also kind of gave last week

2007
02:13:56,940 --> 02:14:03,500
Brussels, it's kind of in this straight jacket of the Brussels capital region, where it doesn't

2008
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:11,340
refer to the spatial scale of the actual netfalls in area of ordinary economic weight of

2009
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:20,220
of the city, whereas in other contexts you see the formation of the larger metropolitan areas

2010
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:28,380
as governance structures, where global city front foot is now a fresh line line, which

2011
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:34,540
have kind of worked in a global city region, organization, which has its own governance

2012
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:42,220
structure etc. So there it's easier to appreciate that emeritus when you compare that to

2013
02:14:42,220 --> 02:14:48,660
So it's a rescaling process and you see that in a lot of Europe being contacted not

2014
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:55,360
seldomly also kind of pushed for by the European Union, who likes to see the Europe of

2015
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:56,360
regions.

2016
02:14:56,360 --> 02:15:04,540
It's kind of this idea that you need larger entities, city regions or regions, to kind

2017
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:08,860
of take control over up to scale economic processes.

2018
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:12,500
So, yeah, a sensitivity to how the state,

2019
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:15,300
especially reorganize itself to all extent,

2020
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:17,860
there's new governance layers to manage

2021
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:19,820
also these economic processes.

2022
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:22,540
That was kind of also added to the state.

2023
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:25,460
And then finally, very final slides,

2024
02:15:25,460 --> 02:15:29,260
is this kind of a critique or a criticism

2025
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:34,100
by people working in the realm of financialization.

2026
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:37,620
I'll say much more about that,

2027
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:40,260
if you take the economic and financial geography course,

2028
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:43,260
it's all about financialization.

2029
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:45,060
But just the point of the fact that

2030
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:50,100
this criticism deals with what it is

2031
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,940
that is going on in world cities.

2032
02:15:52,940 --> 02:15:57,020
So it doesn't really criticize the relevance

2033
02:15:57,020 --> 02:16:01,540
of command and control practices in world and global cities.

2034
02:16:01,540 --> 02:16:03,340
But it says that perhaps the nature

2035
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:05,660
of these activities has transformed

2036
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:09,440
to the past 20 or 30 years.

2037
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:12,240
So financialization, what does it mean?

2038
02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:17,520
It means that an increasing part of economic processes

2039
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:20,960
or value-based processes of profits generally

2040
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:23,000
versus well occurring, you could say,

2041
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
reproductive activities, but is somehow

2042
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,960
connected to financial service.

2043
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:31,800
So financial investments is by owning financial assets

2044
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:36,800
rather than actually produce something that people get rich

2045
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:40,500
and also explains a real way in the qualities

2046
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:44,200
between those who have large huge amounts of wealth

2047
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:46,480
and others who rely on their nature

2048
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:50,000
but we'll say something about that next week.

2049
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,480
So financialization also means that there's a lot

2050
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:58,480
of pressure on corporations to generate returns

2051
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:00,880
for financial investors.

2052
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:03,600
So it's not just about competing with other capitalists

2053
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:06,480
to be the most efficient drug producer

2054
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:08,520
or cooking manufacturers.

2055
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:12,520
It's also to do so, to generate as much shareholder value

2056
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:14,960
compared to your competitors.

2057
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:17,640
It's one, I mean, this kind of quote,

2058
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:18,880
corporate financialization.

2059
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:21,120
It's the restructuring of corporations

2060
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:24,880
so that the shareholder value is actually being created.

2061
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:28,840
So perhaps world cities are still

2062
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:32,920
about seamless service for globalization,

2063
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:35,180
so the management of global production process

2064
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:36,360
is networked.

2065
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:39,000
But this other side, financial markets, perhaps,

2066
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,160
needs to be taken much more seriously.

2067
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:44,440
And these ABS firms may be more in broad and broad

2068
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:49,040
in broad process of finalization, rather than productive

2069
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:49,960
as logics.

2070
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:53,680
So yeah, just--

2071
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:59,680
So yeah, I think what I say here,

2072
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:03,680
we also need to become a obligatory message for other reasons

2073
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:06,680
than the ones that have been assumed already.

2074
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:10,680
And that's why in one paper we talk about an augmented

2075
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:15,680
world city hypothesis is not just about generating value

2076
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:19,680
from productive activities, but it's also about extracting

2077
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:26,080
extracting value to rent extraction practices from those global production networks.

2078
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:31,720
And you can see that, for instance, when we have corporations attract funding, you need

2079
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:40,080
a whole amalgamation of connected ABS firms to issue, in this case, a Euroball, which

2080
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:44,200
is not kind of an offshore investment instrument.

2081
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:48,640
And this is a firm, a real-state corporation,

2082
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:54,160
out of Northern Germany, and kind of pays all these people

2083
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:57,200
to issue that on a global scale.

2084
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:01,160
So to finance its real estate projects in Germany.

2085
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:04,960
So, well, cities are mobilized to attract funding

2086
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:08,240
and to optimize that in a particular way.

2087
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:11,040
The same thing happens when you look at the other side

2088
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:17,600
equation when value has been produced, the point is that you limit the

2089
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:24,240
taxes that you have to pay on your service value. Otherwise, shareholders are

2090
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:27,960
in the police and you're competing with other firms to pay as much share

2091
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:33,400
other value as possible. This is a classic example by Google who is using

2092
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:44,400
Don't Dutch, Irish, sandwich to make sure that it minimizes its taxes, right?

2093
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:48,400
So it puts, I mean, I say it's a bit as an accident, I don't know, then by the way,

2094
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:54,400
but it places some intellectual property in an environment that surrounds it through the Netherlands,

2095
02:19:54,400 --> 02:20:01,400
towards the back of Ireland, and then it passes through the Caribbean to optimize that structure.

2096
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:06,360
It's also something that firms like Deloitte and law firms are also engaged.

2097
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:11,100
So it's the optimization of these kind of financial structures and

2098
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:16,320
materialization is also a very important function of world city.

2099
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:19,920
So in the end, I think to summarize the picture,

2100
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:24,000
it's about, I can say, representation.

2101
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:32,000
You can think about world cities as kind of Mount Everest's aggloperations of wealth.

2102
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:37,520
That has been generated among the little down below across the territory.

2103
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:46,680
But you can also think about how to call an English-dumerion gas 11 kilometers deep.

2104
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:51,880
Where a value that is being produced elsewhere is being extracted to.

2105
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:58,400
is basically putting a drain on the global economy.

2106
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:02,440
And if you look at what happened during the financial crisis,

2107
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:05,880
the financial sector created a whole surplus.

2108
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:08,240
If you will generate a lot of profits,

2109
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,560
then came the crisis.

2110
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:15,200
And I mean, I think in Europe it was the figure of $700 billion

2111
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:17,640
that financial sector was kind of bailed out.

2112
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:19,880
It was even more in the US.

2113
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:24,680
So it's a huge figure of saving these kind of activities,

2114
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:28,080
where in general they actually put in that drain

2115
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:30,120
on the floor when they come.

2116
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:32,960
So we really have to think about world cities

2117
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:36,320
in a critical way, what do they contribute,

2118
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:37,880
or what are the actors in world cities,

2119
02:21:37,880 --> 02:21:40,720
what do they contribute, and what kind of things

2120
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:43,840
effects are more problematic.

2121
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:46,800
I'm very sorry to take a little bit more of your time,

2122
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:51,800
But that was kind of four ways of being critical about world and global cities.

2123
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:57,800
There's no time for Q&A now, but next week we'll continue.

2124
02:21:57,800 --> 02:22:03,800
I mean, we can start with some questions next week if you'd have them.

2125
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:08,800
And we'll go to the flip side to the point.

2126
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:10,800
About flip side of the coin is just polarization.

2127
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:15,800
So what does it mean world and global city formation for these very places?

2128
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:22,800
And these are the two texts that you're worried and fighting to reach.

2129
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:25,800
Thank you.

2130
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:28,800
(audience applauds)



# 3 Polarization in world/global cities

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
[Music]

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,840
Okay, well, everybody, third session, urban social geography.

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,680
This week's topic is polarization, rural and global cities.

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
Now, just a few housekeeping announcements.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,840
I think in the meantime, everybody has seen schedules regarding discussion seminars.

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,640
I think there's still some minor issues here and there.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,400
We'll try to get that sorted as soon as possible, but make sure next week there will be

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,600
a discussion similar to each one of you. So please attend and if you're there to present

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,000
take the guidelines which has five to six to ten minutes of presentation because it will be a

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,640
tight exercise in any case. So I have to practice a little bit at home so that you stay within

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,040
those ten minutes as much as possible and then we'll have a nice discussion.

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,720
also be advised that we started excursions this Friday on start in Brussels for those

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:31,200
urban in urban studies who are joining the global city Brussels excursion and as a reminder we need at

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:41,200
them at the north station Brussels north and we need at plus similar bolifier which is the main

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,780
square at the side of the World Trade Center looking towards the canal. So

16
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,760
Simon Bolivad and you'll see if you're early either me wearing a very special

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,680
hat perhaps and some roses and then if you're late you'll see a whole bunch of

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,280
people so you can't really miss us. In any case you will be down the stairs

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,120
and somewhere on the square there's a few benches there. We will probably

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,280
We end around five at latest in European quarter.

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,520
And yeah, you can bring lunch,

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,240
but you can also buy lunch somewhere

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,280
that will be time over at lunch time

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,720
to actually buy lunch wherever you want to.

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,440
So that's not necessary.

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,040
I have no idea whether it will be the police,

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,000
check the weather forecast and just accordingly.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,920
And as I've learned, the pencil works better than a pen.

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,920
It's kind of a weather proof, although I hope it's not a tornado that's going to hit Brussels.

30
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Okay.

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Right.

32
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:56,920
So last week we've been talking about, you could say how to understand the role of cities in the global economy,

33
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:06,920
whole discussion about command and control functions, to what extends power in this global urban system relates to either headquarters

34
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,920
workers and the more classic world cities definition or are the first to say this amalgamation

35
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:23,080
or complex of advanced producer services who collectively produce control capabilities

36
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,840
over global production networks, global financial markets and also discuss plenty of critiques,

37
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,960
different forms of critique on those startups.

38
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:40,820
What we'll try to do today is turn the coin around and kind of in the spirit of John

39
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,740
Friedman's work back to the 80s, if you will, is also try to reflect on what extent

40
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,580
the insertion in these global urban systems, these powerful roles in the global economy,

41
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,380
also affects the internal structure of cities.

42
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,380
So it's kind of this macro, micro link.

43
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,700
We went from, oh my god, the economy is globalizing.

44
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,020
What does this tell us about the changing role of cities

45
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,620
in that global economy?

46
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,100
Now having established that centrality in the global economy,

47
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,380
now we wonder to what extent there are effects or implications

48
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,460
of that insertion on the social structure of cities.

49
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,780
So it's kind of the flip side of last week's talk.

50
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,420
So just to get started a little bit, some maps.

51
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,660
Was there a question?

52
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,060
- I'm like, what,

53
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,140
I could be honest, I could be honest.

54
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,660
If I can do that, everyone agrees

55
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,860
because we don't break it.

56
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,140
You know, it's a must.

57
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,980
- Yes.

58
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,820
- It's a must.

59
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,660
- Straight forward.

60
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,580
- I understand, yes, it was a bit back.

61
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,700
So let's try to have a break somewhere

62
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,780
at six, something or five,

63
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,220
but I'll six, yeah, sure.

64
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,060
No problem.

65
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,860
Yeah, some maps.

66
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,940
I will, yes.

67
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:07,420
The live stream isn't working.

68
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,500
Okay.

69
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,340
Or rather not okay.

70
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:23,740
It is recording.

71
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:33,160
Now as you can see there's a red button there and I think the audio is supposed to work.

72
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,820
Zero viewers okay that gives us a hint.

73
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,460
Let's see.

74
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,460
wrong link. Okay, let's see.

75
00:05:51,460 --> 00:06:07,580
All right, let me just put this online.

76
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,580
(audience chattering)

77
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:39,580
[ Background Sounds ]

78
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:46,580
It looks awfully the same.

79
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,580
Doesn't it?

80
00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:19,580
[inaudible]

81
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:26,300
There's already one viewer. So that means it works. Yeah, I think we're there.

82
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:34,620
Is it okay? Yeah. All right, then.

83
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:46,300
Okay, I could just try to start again. I started so maths always nice.

84
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:54,620
Please unmaps from the study of the talk a little bit more about in a second from the opportunity

85
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:03,500
at last in the US. Basically shows you the median household income of residents over a certain period.

86
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:10,700
So this is Chicago, the darker, I mean the the bluer, the richer if you will, the higher the income

87
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,060
And the more the U.S. is red, it's lowering.

88
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:21,060
So what I've kind of seen is very much kind of concentrated wealth in the city center,

89
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,100
apparently of Chicago.

90
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,980
And then the peripheries, these kind of other rings of Chicago,

91
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,420
with lower incomes, and then going back further from the center,

92
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:39,220
richer neighborhoods, kind of the opposite picture here

93
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,820
In Detroit, I'll show some examples from the US because this is great material in that.

94
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:53,060
Here we see a very large concentration of the poverty or lower incomes in the city center,

95
00:08:53,060 --> 00:09:00,420
or it's actually the city of Detroit, which interestingly ends at this kind of road here.

96
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:09,220
a tomorrow road which you may know if you still know who Eminem is. He's been talking about this.

97
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:15,540
The old born and raised somewhere over there. It acts as kind of a city limit.

98
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,380
You could say the inner city neighborhood and also kind of a fiscal limit.

99
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:29,220
At this point we see that actually it's a quite strong social spatial divide between

100
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,660
or neighborhoods in the city center and then richer. Subverts, you may know that Detroit has

101
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:44,820
gone into default a few years ago, so it's kind of a weird situation because it is a rich

102
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,060
agglomeration, if you will, but the city itself, which kind of ends at the 8 mile road,

103
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,940
is quite poor. So there's a lot of people commuting into the city that quite rich,

104
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,380
but the physical base of the city itself is kind of it's kind of limited. Okay. So quite a

105
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:15,620
large rupture there in space. Other examples are Los Angeles, a lot of inner city poverty and very

106
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:24,460
which suburbs, if you will, we all know Beverly Hills and those kind of areas.

107
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:33,240
This is Miami, just another example, from a stark contrast at the neighborhood level between

108
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,320
It's a north Miami and south Miami.

109
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,000
No, so quite a stark difference between,

110
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
say Miami Beach, where the tourist areas are.

111
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,200
And the continent, if you will,

112
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,400
what is kind of interesting in the case of Miami

113
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,840
is that actually from a climatological

114
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,160
environmental perspective,

115
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,560
that's actually quite safe to live all short.

116
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,240
And these are kind of the foreign neighborhoods

117
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,800
with kind of increased strength of floods

118
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,080
and those kind of things.

119
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,280
We see some kind of a movement back onshore also

120
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,880
by richer people.

121
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,600
Some people call this climate related gentrification.

122
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,880
We start seeing an appreciation of real estate values

123
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,800
onshore.

124
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,040
So it kind of shows that environmental impacts

125
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,640
also kind of start impacting social spatial divisions.

126
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Another example of Nua Linz, as you may know,

127
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:44,640
from more than a decade ago, it was hit by a large hurricane,

128
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,640
and also had a very differentiated effect in racialized and ethnic terms.

129
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,640
A lot of people were hit, were left without help.

130
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
A lot of people residing in these foreign neighborhoods

131
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,640
also has a different kind of ethnic background.

132
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,640
So again, quite a bit of conditions there.

133
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:12,640
San Francisco looks pretty well gentrified,

134
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,640
also kind of very common sensical.

135
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,640
I mean, you look at real estate price in the wider San Francisco Bay area.

136
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,640
And it's obviously also related to this kind of happiness

137
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:34,960
or global city regionism that is going on there, but just still a few pockets of the

138
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,440
public for instance, China town there to the north, perhaps also the mission which is a kind of

139
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,520
which the mother neighborhood, yes.

140
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,000
- Because in the city that there's a piece right there,

141
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,360
they can have a key room that will

142
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,360
get up, that can be normalized towards the specific.

143
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,040
- You know what I mean about that?

144
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,560
- No, I think it's, if you look at the scale,

145
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,200
it's the same everywhere, right?

146
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,960
So you can compare across cities as well.

147
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,680
It's a good point, it could mean that we kind of lose

148
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,160
some of the nuance in certain places.

149
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,400
But what you gain is comparability across cities.

150
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,920
But I can say a bit more about that in a second.

151
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,920
New York, a city that we'll be talking more about,

152
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,320
very kind of rich, lower-man-hand,

153
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,200
who worked at the north, I feel a bit like a weatherman here.

154
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,280
You're into the north.

155
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,120
It's, as we know, a bit more cloudy.

156
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,480
No, I mean, it's an area with lower incomes, the Bronx.

157
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,080
Interesting area is also here, Brooklyn,

158
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,800
which we'll be talking about a bit later,

159
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,880
which kind of follows the income characteristics

160
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,640
of Manhattan.

161
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,760
There's a kind of still lowerness.

162
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,240
And we have a little Italy, and there's

163
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,720
kind of places where still, you could say,

164
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
giving some shelter to people that are not crazy rich.

165
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,720
But you could say a lot of concentrated wealth in the center,

166
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,720
then a whole kind of area with a poorer population,

167
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,720
and then you could say the rich kind of suburbs begin again.

168
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Now the point is not necessarily today to talk about spatial structures.

169
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,720
You'll talk a way more about that with Nick,

170
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,720
and you'll discuss segregation patterns and those kind of things.

171
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,720
What I want to focus on is mostly you could say the reality of,

172
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,720
you could say, the vision, income divisions, class divisions in cities.

173
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,720
So where do these examples come from?

174
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,720
This is, I think you'll find it the great website.

175
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
It's called the opportunity Atlas.

176
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,720
And what I've actually had intense to do,

177
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,520
that also connects to the work of Nick or that.

178
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,800
Things that Nick will talk about.

179
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,720
It tries to trace, you could say, neighborhood effects.

180
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,400
And the idea is that the neighborhood

181
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,640
that you raise them will have a substantial role

182
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,320
in your future life chances.

183
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,920
And they're basically, but you can read more about it

184
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,320
on this webpage.

185
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,880
They basically tracked the evolution of people

186
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,700
kind of life development or careers of people linking it back to their original

187
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,360
neighborhood. So to the place they were born. So they could say, okay, people that

188
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,000
report in the Bronx, 16 years later, what is the kind of chance they become

189
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,760
incarcerated, what is their income level, etc. etc. So it's kind of in the way

190
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:57,520
trying to measure some form of spatial privilege, but having resided or

191
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,480
being born in certain neighborhoods that will have actually an effect which is in some way

192
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,080
you could say reducible to the amenities that you have to the social context that you have.

193
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,240
But perhaps there's also even more than that maybe some kind of isolated spatial effect

194
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
beyond.

195
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,920
But that's kind of the wider context of this up-loss and I think, yeah, it's, I would have

196
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,320
hoped that we had this for Europe.

197
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,880
It's a great resource and you can browse a bit to that.

198
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,180
So what I just want to focus on today is the fact, or use as exhibits, are these income

199
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,560
maps to illustrate that polarization in terms of income is a day to day reality in a lot

200
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,200
of US metropolises.

201
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,400
Had we had the data in Europe, we would also find quite stark contrast, perhaps a little

202
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,400
bit less, but still, it would also be there.

203
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:00,660
So what we can discuss then today I think is to what extent clause divisions are reproduced

204
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:08,260
in and through space and actually try to understand why such divisions occur in cities

205
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,260
in the first place.

206
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,620
Now this is a very big debate obviously.

207
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:17,400
What we'll try to do is try to link that to the debate we have last week and try to

208
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,440
linked to what extends global and relatively functions add to existing polarization because

209
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:32,600
we cannot reduce it to an effect of having headquarters or something, but perhaps entering

210
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,000
the discussion through globalized urbanization, we could actually start unpacking some of this.

211
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,800
So, glass divisions are about the fact that we see social spatial structures on the basis of

212
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,600
social groupings of income, profession, occupational structure and those that.

213
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,320
So looking through income levels and occupation, we find a social

214
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,960
especially diverse structure. Now I use class here in a very, let's say,

215
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,400
analytical naive way because if you use class, in many cases, authors would also refer to

216
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:22,120
some form of identity formation linked to that. That's not what I do here. It's more of a much more

217
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:29,720
mundane looking at income levels to look at the change extractor of the city. There's big debates

218
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:36,520
to what extent there is still such thing as class identity. It has something to do with

219
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,760
existence of subcultures, depolitization, etc. That's not really the point here. It would be

220
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,680
interesting debate, it's more about can we see objective, objective,

221
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:53,640
viable divisions there in society based on income and occupation, okay, just to clear that

222
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:02,600
moment. All right, so polarization, it has been on the agenda, it has been one of the main

223
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:09,960
source of impetus or starting point for the world in global cities debate. And again, going

224
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,800
back to John Friedman and Sir Wolf in 1982. It's what kind of initiated their

225
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,000
interests there. So just to allow me to recite with its towers of stealing glass

226
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,840
and its scientific shopping malls, the Citadel is the city's most vulnerable

227
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,880
symbol. Its smooth surfaces suggest a sleek and personality of money power. Its

228
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,720
Its interior spaces are ample elegant and plush.

229
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
In a properly secluded space is the transnational elites

230
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,800
who have built their residences and playgrounds.

231
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,520
Country clubs and bridal paths and private beaches.

232
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,560
The overcrowded ghettos exist in the far shadows of the citadel

233
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,160
where it is further divided into racial and ethnic enclaves.

234
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,000
Some areas are shanty towns.

235
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,280
Not well provided with public services,

236
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,640
garbage is that does not get collected.

237
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,440
only the police in the squad cars visible in evidence.

238
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,760
In many places, get to residence or allowed outside

239
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,960
to zones only during working hours.

240
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,280
Their appearance in the Citadel After Dark creates a small panic.

241
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,160
So it's kind of a very dystopian image.

242
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,240
You can say it's exaggerated.

243
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,600
It's kind of not exactly empowering.

244
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
It's also very black-white.

245
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
But it's something with this opposition

246
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,760
that they try to work with some kind of growing divide

247
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,040
and cities that is going to become a social problem.

248
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,000
And that's also what you also read in the world

249
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,880
city hypothesis of self-self-free crime.

250
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,440
It's at some point it will become everybody's problem

251
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,680
and probably also the problem of the elite.

252
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,080
Now again, this kind of description,

253
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,440
tries to capture particular reality.

254
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Last week, I think I mentioned Robert De Niro and taxi driver.

255
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
Perhaps John Friedman was talking more,

256
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,800
talking about contemporary LA,

257
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,440
which is kind of marked by this citadel form

258
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,480
that we have left if you have been to LA.

259
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,120
I mean, a lot of elites or people that are walking around here

260
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,040
never touch ground.

261
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,280
They hover around, they never go on the ground floor,

262
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,400
but it's kind of a problem to jump by taxi

263
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,040
and one of the hotels and then they go

264
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,760
at the first floor level,

265
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,200
or second floor level in the US,

266
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,880
from one building to another.

267
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,920
So it's not only kind of horizontally segregated,

268
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,560
there's also kind of vertical segregation there

269
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,200
so this kind of this flow of people

270
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,200
is not mixed with buses by.

271
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,000
Then a bit further, just kind of two, three, four,

272
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,520
It is both streets LA not to be confused with Wall Street in New York and this is kind of where

273
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,760
a completely different kind of neighborhood start. So as you remember this map from LA,

274
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:18,680
in general you could say a very poor inner city neighborhood but kind of imprinted by a number of

275
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:28,520
hotels which kind of breathe post-modern feelings and sentiments, but then very close to that

276
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:36,280
immediately you kind of struck with rapid decline. Some people would call this the zone of transition

277
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,600
and we'll be talking with Nick about the Bergus model of cities. There's a kind of a place that

278
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,040
that isn't changed. It's kind of changing functions. It's also a place where a lot of

279
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:55,000
migrants arrive. There's a lot of informal economy, etc. And there's also kind of an idea

280
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,360
even in contemporary LA that these places, the citadel, if you will, these hotels are also places

281
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,560
that should not be frequented by people that have nothing to do there. And just, yeah, as I walk by,

282
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:16,360
I think it was a doorstep of a plaza of a bank of America or something that I took it.

283
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Yeah, bank tower at 53. And it's kind of regulating social space there.

284
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,760
And yeah, you can't really read it now, but maybe you should read it at home.

285
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,200
This kind of very ambiguous language being used. So any activities that are

286
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,320
has a phrase again that may be annoyance or uses,

287
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,280
that are already annoying people or could annoy people,

288
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,120
or actually not allow them there.

289
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,280
So it's a very, you could say,

290
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,360
a vigorous fake description,

291
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,640
which gives, for instance, social security guards

292
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,880
the liberty to actually remove people from public space,

293
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:07,480
people that are homeless and there's a huge homelessness issue. In LA, people are being displaced,

294
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,000
even if they put their tents in downtown. There's a little pan-handling selling stuff and those kind

295
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,680
of things and that is kind of policed away. So it's not, it's to be removed from that public space

296
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,120
because it doesn't fit the kind of perhaps expectations of people that that's frequent these

297
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:35,160
more like citadel structures. So we can say it could be an extreme example but still very much

298
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:43,160
relevant today, 30 or 40 years after Children's Treatment was started out. This is, say, one of the

299
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:52,120
leading matropolises and economic terms of the world. So if it's happening here, we could

300
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,680
imagine it's also happening elsewhere. Now what I would try to do now is look a little bit into

301
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:07,960
exhibits about this archetypical case if you will, New York City. To show you a bit more

302
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:17,720
how polarization patterns have evolved over the past decades. I mean it's a Greek drama, you know

303
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:25,800
already what is happening and the answer is polarization has increased. So income disparities

304
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:33,080
between different kind of income groups in society has increased. And why in New York? Well, I mean,

305
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,800
it's one of the, say, has been one of the city's world cities that has, has received a lot of

306
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,760
attention. It's still one of the main financial centers of the world. It's kind of an extreme case,

307
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:53,880
if you will, if you try to research the impact of these kind of activities on the urban fabric.

308
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:01,920
So, I'm referring here to a very nice study by the fiscal policy institute.

309
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,560
It's a bit dated, but I still love it.

310
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,600
I'm actually hoping that it will do the exercise again quite soon.

311
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:16,120
The previous one, report was just before the crisis, this one is kind of diagnosing what

312
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,000
when done just after the crisis and I hope they have some kind of I don't know

313
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,600
a bit of COVID kind of report sometimes soon but they mostly look in these studies at the

314
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,760
evolution of income distribution and they use all kind of weird terms such as these

315
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:43,240
styles, quintiles, quartiles which refers to the place of an income group any entire

316
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,240
So a quintile is actually a fifth of the entire distribution.

317
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,240
So top quintile would be the top 20% of earners and their average income.

318
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:02,240
The bottom quintile would be the average of the lowest 20% of incomes.

319
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,240
So these are relative terms that show the position with a certain income.

320
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,240
What you would take position you would take in this distribution.

321
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,240
And it's usually focusing on income, which is income

322
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,200
out of labor in one way or in order.

323
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,240
Okay.

324
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,160
So this is just one comparison.

325
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,120
And what they also do is,

326
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,720
and they try to compare New York City quite often.

327
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,040
Sometimes they don't have data on New York City itself,

328
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,080
and then they use New York State,

329
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,280
but try to be as specific as possible.

330
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,120
And then they also try to compare to United States.

331
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
That's a question.

332
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,120
[inaudible]

333
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Yeah.

334
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,120
[inaudible]

335
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,120
[inaudible]

336
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,120
[inaudible]

337
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Yeah. I think, I mean, large would be polarization,

338
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,120
but the point is indeed, and that's kind of something that we get to later,

339
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,960
is that the question is, obviously,

340
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,120
more easily start looking at income,

341
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,520
because these kinds of data are,

342
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,880
it is defined.

343
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,920
The next question is what's the underlying occupational structure,

344
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,120
so what produces that reality?

345
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,360
And there's something that we'll pick up on later,

346
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,680
and obviously connected quite often,

347
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,920
kind of you could think about,

348
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,400
shift towards high-end service jobs,

349
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,040
what generates higher incomes?

350
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,120
But the connection is not always there,

351
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,680
it's always highly contextual,

352
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,840
the same kind of occupations,

353
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,280
in different contexts may give a very different income level

354
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,920
and that can be for a lot of reasons.

355
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,520
So yeah, but here we're talking about income polarization

356
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,920
to be sure because it's the most obvious here and now.

357
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,960
So yeah, as I said, they tried to compare

358
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,280
give me your work, sometimes they use in the New York state, etc. So what you see is here,

359
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:21,040
the median family income, so this kind of people that are just in the middle of this distribution,

360
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:28,880
this has been declining over the past, I think 10, I mean, in this case it's kind of three,

361
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:36,000
four years after the great recession, right? So we see that 2008, it has 9, 2010, 2011,

362
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,760
you find the steep decline and it's actually more pronounced in the city of New York.

363
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,520
So the city of New York on average, the median income was already much lower than compared to

364
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,640
New York state which is kind of more affairs to the broader agglomeration mostly but then also the

365
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:02,080
rest of the state and it was also significantly lower at a magazine. So in general, there's a decline

366
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:09,840
and median income in the city of New York. At the same time what we see at the other kind of

367
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:19,600
side of the picture is the share of income, total income, going to the top 1%. And here is again a

368
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:28,880
comparison between US in red, then the state of New York in green and then New York city kind of

369
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,040
small scale in blue, which is on top line. So it's kind of interesting to see and this

370
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,360
data goes back to the 1980s. They'll share very similar patterns there at the beginning.

371
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:48,320
The share of income going to the top 1%, that's just reminds yourself 1% of the entire distribution

372
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:58,480
that the top 1% against the 99 remember was about 12% or 3% in the 1980s. This has exploded right.

373
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:08,320
So it has grown across all scales to something modest off, you could say 22% in the US.

374
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:15,440
So 1% owns 22% of all income, just reflect on that.

375
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:25,680
And then in New York, we see that almost 45, almost half of all income is owned by the top 1%.

376
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:32,000
Okay, so we all know Jeff Bezos and others, but this is kind of way more systematic. Yes

377
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:50,600
Yeah, but the previous one yeah, that's true. I mean this is just a figure

378
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:58,600
And it's one of the perfect options that you can take.

379
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Yeah, this too.

380
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
That's right.

381
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:07,600
This is kind of, you could say, the median income has decreased everywhere.

382
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
It does seem to find here.

383
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,600
I would say that it decreases more in New York City compared to others.

384
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,440
less you would have to look at percent just there for New York State of the US.

385
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,240
But I think it's kind of going from 59 to 54. Yeah, that's a very significantly

386
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,800
client. But it's not one online comparable, you're right. So this goes back way more in time.

387
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:41,600
But the main point being here is that a very small percentage is actually running away with a

388
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:49,520
lot of income and again in the CFA, there was connection to what you were asking. There was a decline

389
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:58,400
in general also for these top 1% with the global financial crisis but you also see that it's kind

390
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:05,120
of very quick rebound of these highest incomes, right? So they kind of take a hit and it has

391
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,480
something to do probably with their, like they're exposed to so much parts of the economy,

392
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:20,480
but then they rebans quite soon. Okay. Another kind of graph here comparing New York state to the US,

393
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:28,320
so unfortunately not at the city level, but yeah, you get an idea. Here it's comparing a top 5%

394
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:36,720
in terms of income and total income, which you could say the bottom quintile, so the 20%

395
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,920
lowest incomes, and then the middle group, right? So from 40 to 60%, but in the distribution.

396
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:52,240
So what you find is that over the years, and this is comparing the late 70s,

397
00:33:52,800 --> 00:34:00,480
to say the mid 2000s. I mean it's a dated analysis but that's the furthest that they could go in

398
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:12,320
this analysis. In the 1970s the ratio between the top 5% and the lowest incomes was 7.4. So people

399
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,200
in the top 5 earn 7.4 times more than people with the lowest incomes and the lowest quintile

400
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,040
By the mid 2000s it had become 17.3 times.

401
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:33,120
So take the income of the lowest income households times 17.3.

402
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,480
So tremendous tremendously growing difference.

403
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,600
And it's also when you prepare to get a right growing much faster than what you see in US in general.

404
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,600
And it still also pertains to the relation between the top 5% and you,

405
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,680
but you could say the middle income group or the middle class,

406
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,520
even there are kind of these disparities have doubled and they have increased more

407
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:08,880
when you compare it to the US. So it went from 2.9 to 5.3 compared to 4.7 when compared to US.

408
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,120
Okay, so massively increasing that difference.

409
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,920
So it means that there's a growing concentration of income in a very small group.

410
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,680
Another exhibit showing this is comparing the growth in income between different groups.

411
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,600
So the bottom quintile again, lowest incomes actually lost a share in total income.

412
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,240
When you compare the late 90s to the mid 2000s,

413
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,440
there was some growth for middle income groups

414
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,080
and it was a very large group,

415
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,080
but growth of 18 to 19% can come off the line.

416
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,880
And so the trends are kind of clear.

417
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,480
There was a slow hiccup with the global financial crisis,

418
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,440
but it's kind of a secular trend

419
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,360
where a very small percentage of the population,

420
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:11,440
it 1% or 5% is gaining more and more share in the total distribution of ink.

421
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,120
One way of looking at that is why that could be and we'll talk about general patterns

422
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:27,440
also more towards the end of today's session is looking at what happens in evolutions of productivity.

423
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,220
So with one hour of work, what kind of value do you produce?

424
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,920
How much cookies do you cut or how much hard do you make?

425
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,800
Or how much, let's say, transactions, financial transactions.

426
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,080
Can you conclude?

427
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,160
Versus the income from those activities.

428
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:56,720
So what you see is that from 2001 until 2011 here,

429
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,200
There's actually a 14% increase in productivity.

430
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,840
So for the same hour of work,

431
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,680
you produce 14% more wealth, if you will.

432
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,120
But when you look at the income levels from labor

433
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,400
and you will average real wage,

434
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,760
so these are the salaries that people get.

435
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,960
It has increased a little bit,

436
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,200
but it has by no means kept base with the rises

437
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,440
and productivity levels.

438
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,340
Okay, so it's kind of, it's running away.

439
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,400
So there's an increase of about,

440
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,880
what is it here, two, three, four percent?

441
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,600
As we go across those 10 years.

442
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,440
So that means that something else is probably happening

443
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,440
with the weld and value that's being created.

444
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,680
And we talked a little bit about financialization last week.

445
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,200
It means that it's, if it's not going to labor,

446
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,080
it's probably going to the factor of capital,

447
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:03,240
which means shareholders or you could say well-remunerated employees such as CEOs, managers

448
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,120
who actually take a growing piece of the cake.

449
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,120
What do you want to do with this?

450
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
Can you talk about this?

451
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,960
Yeah, this is New York.

452
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:22,520
Well, get to more global patterns more towards the end as a kind of an outlook exercise.

453
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,560
But it's a trend that is occurring across countries, right?

454
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,800
And there's probably no the work of Thomas Piketty.

455
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,840
It may have run a bell already.

456
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:40,480
He and his group of, I can say, economic historians have looked

457
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,160
at systematically at income data and income distribution data

458
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,000
in a more long-term perspective.

459
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,520
And they can't compare all countries

460
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,420
because their data sources are limited,

461
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,220
but they require a number of key European countries,

462
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,760
US, UK, Australia, et cetera, et cetera.

463
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,020
So yeah, these are unfortunately

464
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,800
patterns we see everywhere,

465
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,800
but in some contexts they're more extreme than elsewhere.

466
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,120
And US, UK, and we'll get to that at some point

467
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,400
are the most extreme cases here.

468
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,200
So yeah, runaway productivity, but not necessarily

469
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,600
more remuneration.

470
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,360
On the other side is--

471
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:34,640
and I think a very telling graph is, to what extent

472
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,120
can you make a living, a decent living,

473
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,960
if you work full time, all the minimum wage?

474
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,600
This was the analysis.

475
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,720
And I go back again to the 1980s, is it right?

476
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Yeah, or even earlier, and you see that you're in a substantial period of time.

477
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,720
If you were at a minimum wage, you were well above the poverty line, right?

478
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:07,720
So you had like 120% so you could live here well decently and you wouldn't live in poverty.

479
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
And this has completely melted away.

480
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,720
So it became very bad in the kind of 1990s, but even well in today,

481
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,640
You see that even if you work full-time at this weight,

482
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,520
you still fall below the poverty line.

483
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,120
So it's kind of something institutionally is wrong there.

484
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,000
And the fiscal policy institute has been one of the main advocates

485
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,200
also for an increase in minimum wages.

486
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:41,080
And yeah, and a lot of metropolitan areas also, for instance, in London.

487
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:49,080
There's also kind of the month for a long living wage, which sometimes should be higher

488
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,920
than in the rest of the country because this kind of the living, it's just more expensive

489
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,160
in these large metropolitan areas. So a very dire picture, a lot of people at the very bottom

490
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,040
are not only, you could say, you could say, losing out in terms of income levels,

491
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:14,040
It's also still it's not sufficient to actually make to nothing when you're at that side of the income distribution.

492
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:21,320
So just to give you a bit of a picture from this RUB extreme case of the the sincerity of the situation.

493
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:29,880
And yeah you can find this report online pulling apart in New York and I would recommend that you

494
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,880
have looked at that. I think the conclusion is that we see in growing income

495
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,320
polarization in the state of New York, more narrowly in New York City, and it's

496
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:48,440
becoming more dramatic than the US average. Okay, over to you for another one

that specifically world-in global cities are becoming so

Okay, let's hear it.

00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,340
It's when you came up with.

508
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:10,340
What did you come up with?

509
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,340
Yeah.

510
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:27,340
So there's a comment about the cost of living.

511
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:38,340
The correct, but it's more, you can say more a symptom, if you will, I mean, it's kind of the price of real estate, housing, daily consumption, etc.

512
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:45,340
You can say it affects everybody to similar degree unless we acknowledge that there's even more differences.

513
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:51,340
I mean, that's because of living for the rich would be also very high, but maybe they can afford it.

514
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,340
It's not really an explanation of why we see polarization at stake.

515
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:02,340
I think other governments are into the trickle-down effects of the regulatory development.

516
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:09,340
So we see large companies already have a lot of capital, getting more subsidies from the government,

517
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:17,340
getting placed in say special economic zones where electricity land leaves around the government.

518
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,340
A lot of things are subsidized.

519
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,340
Again, I tried to be well-providing employment.

520
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,380
However, that said employment,

521
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,380
the salary is not distributing.

522
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:33,060
So you have the larger company getting larger.

523
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,380
- What do you mean with trickle down, logics?

524
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,220
- Yes.

525
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,380
So, I mean, the right to recover that is, of course,

526
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,820
then if you have a large company,

527
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:53,580
It provides employment and ideas scenario is that more women, people who do it more money,

528
00:45:53,580 --> 00:46:00,080
etc. What often happens is that the job 1% of the job which you will probably get larger

529
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,580
income and the contribution is right here.

530
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:11,580
So yeah, this important critique I think is also what Princess Doreen Massey was talking about,

531
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,860
I mean, and throughout her career, fighting this kind of trickle down economic principle,

532
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:24,060
and she talks about course of global cityization, which is actually producing inequalities,

533
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,860
which are not as much as let's wait for a bit more global city formation,

534
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:35,500
and it will be easy away. What she actually says, no, this polarization is an outcome of

535
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,380
of global city formation, it's because you have certain

536
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,840
activities that you have.

537
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,300
It's not something permanent.

538
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,140
And not something that will go away,

539
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,980
but more trickle down economics.

540
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,980
So because economics is something with,

541
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,020
like that you create multipliers,

542
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,620
that money circulates to the territory,

543
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,700
which then create jobs,

544
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,700
where then fuel growth, et cetera.

545
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,940

of business climate.

561
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:36,180
Well, national policies that are restructuring the detection of labor,

562
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:45,500
I also think that the cities are trying to struggle to attract global companies and that

563
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,500
at the end, global companies, they don't really enrich these budgets with the taxes because

564
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:56,700
they're either evaded, either the city trying to once get a try to build a global company

565
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,700
to try to sell some space.

566
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:05,020
They have in terms of subsidies, but then like taxes, if something supports the overall

567
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:11,580
more like insecure parts of population and then like they are like low income

568
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:18,340
more aggressive and then just support the opportunity. Okay let's there was a

569
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:23,820
little vamp's from there so spatial redistribution yeah. I would just like to add

570
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:30,660
the role of this state in regulation, real in taxation and also being social

571
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,520
So this is something in one of the class,

572
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,360
just mentions it very briefly about the different mental states

573
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,160
of life is like this process that's shaped in states

574
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,240
that have a more active role, and it is something

575
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,840
that also shapes this position.

00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,400

than say, in, you know, rural Britain?

618
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,300
Maybe because it's poverty is less present there,

619
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:28,820
that's present there, although I would like to see map of that. But yeah, I think the

624
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:23,300
is still solidarity between people and to what extent the urban environment still supports that.

625
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:28,600
You've covered quite a bit of ground. I don't have it in my slides all that

626
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,120
But I think it shows what you can do collectively in trying to

627
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:37,060
Try to get this puzzle. So thank you for that. What I just want to do is is

628
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:42,980
Thank you to a number of slides because I think try to gather a number of elements and then work towards this

629
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,660
polarization thesis

630
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:51,460
However, full of all it is will try to try to get there and then we'll take a short break

631
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:59,620
So yeah conceptualization, all of books have been written about this.

632
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:06,620
I've been most of them referring to the global city, but there's plenty of other kind of scholarship on that.

633
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:21,620
As you can see in this picture, it has been one of the main kind of theorized conceptualized problems of contemporary cities and something with what you do with these dualities.

634
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:28,620
Jomonkov and Manuken cells talked about dual cities, Susan feinstein,

635
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:33,180
wrote by the divided cities, Peter Marker is another great scholar talked about

636
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:37,980
water cities, Berger talked about fragmented cities etc.

637
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,180
So it has been one of the main debates in urban social

638
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:47,140
chocolate. But it seems that all these kinds of things

639
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:53,620
necessarily or most emblematically start to connect to cities rather than wider

640
00:55:53,620 --> 00:56:01,960
territories. And a lot of people start to look for particular answers as I said

641
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:07,060
last week I tend to go back to the 80s because it's kind of my my natural

642
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:14,060
cohort but quite often people go back to the 60s the 70s and this kind of wider

643
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:18,900
the restructure of cities and wider economies,

644
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,420
and we could say the North Atlantic sphere.

645
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,620
So it's, I mean, there's a lot of things have been written.

646
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:30,140
There's a rich scholarship, but arguably it's kind of biased,

647
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:34,940
if you will, to the crisis of cities or the crisis cities

648
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:39,100
have underwent in Western Europe, North and America.

649
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,100
So there's plenty of stuff that needs to be

650
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:48,540
written on the histories and these historical trajectories of, say, Chinese cities,

651
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:57,660
African cities, etc, etc. But it's not something that I can now cover today, okay? But

652
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:05,900
it's, yeah, kind of the general narrative that you find in these different kind of analysis

653
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,700
is that the economic restructuring kind of started in the 1960s,

654
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:15,180
when there's a culmination of the crisis of what they call

655
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,140
North Atlantic 4-Dism. And as I think explained last week or two weeks ago,

656
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:27,900
there was this system of regulating capitalism, but there was a deal, say, between the workers

657
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:35,340
and capital that increased productivity, would that the fruits of that and the

658
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,860
the surface of that would be shared with birds.

659
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:42,900
It's kind of forward going back to Henry Ford.

660
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:48,500
He pages workers a little bit more so there would be more productive, but they could actually

661
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,300
in fact also buy the cars that they were producing at the hellish speed.

662
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,580
So that was kind of the wider model.

663
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:02,060
We saw the emergence of the middle classes and the immediate post-war era.

664
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:07,500
could buy consumer goods because of rising productivity levels.

665
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:13,580
It was the invention of free time to actually spend your money and consume it as we actually

666
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,780
go to shop shops and buy stuff.

667
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:21,540
At some point this model kind of started to crumble.

668
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,740
There were problems with productivity.

669
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:34,220
It couldn't keep up with rising wages and kind of at the macro level the solution was a

670
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:41,500
relocation of production and you could say the start point of globalization, new international

671
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,300
division of labor.

672
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:48,100
The effect was that it was the industrialization in, you could say, the core of the

673
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,700
world economy, his high income industrialized places.

674
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,340
So again, we're talking about Northern America,

675
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,700
Western Europe mostly.

676
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:02,980
And it's set in motion to process of structural unemployment,

677
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:07,140
which was felt throughout countries and territories,

678
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,220
but was very, very urban and many contacts.

679
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:16,660
There was a lot of productive activities within cities.

680
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:20,820
And as these activities moved away became obsolete,

681
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,820
What happened is that you could say urban poverty

682
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,900
and an employment became very much urban phenomena.

683
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,020
So cities lost their functions, productive functions,

684
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,340
but they had to do with a lot of,

685
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,020
they could say the costs of an employment, et cetera, et cetera.

686
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,540
So we have a declining tax base

687
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:44,540
and in many contexts what you see is a shift towards austerity.

688
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:50,380
So there's less income, so this budget cuts, et cetera, et cetera.

689
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:56,580
So the whole idea and the immediate post war era was a strong key engine state.

690
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:01,340
So we had mass production, mass consumption, but also a state that was inspired by

691
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:08,420
German and East said, okay, if there's an issue with consumption, well,

692
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,460
the government itself will be of the first investor will make sure that,

693
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,340
that the economy keeps on going.

694
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,900
That kind of changed in this period as well.

695
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,180
The state was seen as something that had to roll back

696
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:27,880
its activities, stop interfering with all kinds of market-based

697
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,140
processes.

698
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:35,900
And so this kind of the starting point of a new liberal ideology,

699
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,700
whereas the state was still kind of setting the rules

700
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,620
of market systems.

701
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:48,620
It stopped indeed providing, for instance, a whole range of public goods that were mentioned

702
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:49,820
in many contexts.

703
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:55,420
So most of the, I mean, accentuated this took place in the US and UK, you can say,

704
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:01,100
neoliberal, harsh lands or the leading examples of that with Margaret Thatcher,

705
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:07,580
Ronald Reagan. But it started to creep in and affect, became some kind of a mobile policy

706
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,180
that was also in practice being implemented in other contexts.

707
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:16,700
Sometimes to a lesser expense in a more variegated way, etc.

708
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:23,580
And the whole research agenda by, for instance, Jamie Beck, a very nice and one of the leading

709
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:31,500
scholars in urban geography is about that. So what is neoliberalism? What is neoliberalization?

710
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,540
Is it the same everywhere? How variegated? How does it connect itself to different kinds of

711
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:43,180
context that's a holding here. So we see those ideas spreading a lot across a lot of these,

712
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:50,300
say, Western American, North American states. And in one way or another, it leads to some kind of

713
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:57,580
use of self-affirmative prophecy, because as the state retreats from certain areas, it

714
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:03,940
It regulates very often a lot of these markets, which

715
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,500
hands more power to large corporations.

716
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:13,220
And we already talked about multinational corporations last week.

717
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,940
And we see a rising concentration of power,

718
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,980
of industrial and financial conglomerations, et cetera, et cetera.

719
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,100
And indeed, in the process where also the state

720
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,620
is kind of rescaled, where a lot of responsibilities

721
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:34,180
kind of pushed to the local level, you get some kind of a self-fulling mantra of competing cities

722
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:43,220
to attract global capital. So that's kind of the situation where a lot of policymakers

723
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:53,140
could say in the 1980s, the 1980s were kind of facing a kind of zero-sum game where there's only

724
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:59,380
so much production for instance to take place so Amazon will have its center

725
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:06,100
either here or it will go across the border and what can we do about that?

726
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:12,660
Well David Harvey is one of the the the main scholars in this area he says

727
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:18,420
well what we see that a lot of policymakers are trying to do is they try to

728
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,380
to become entrepreneurial, right?

729
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:25,580
So whereas they were managing the territories

730
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:29,660
and trying to think about the spatial structures

731
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:33,820
of welfare, humanities, and to distribute growth

732
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,260
across the territory, you kind of get the flip side,

733
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,340
much more competitive idea about growth,

734
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,100
and a new kind of role for people

735
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,980
that were previously managing territories

736
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,500
to become some kind of entrepreneurs, right?

737
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:53,320
David Harvey talks about this in his famous piece and I think people in the

738
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,500
Muslim forces also discuss this with Matthew.

739
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:03,780
He describes the shift from urban managerialism to urban

740
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:10,300
entrepreneurs and where you get a different kind of mindset with boss.

741
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:15,100
Now, okay, so this is kind of the multiraceted structure,

742
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,460
but it's kind of the reasoning of how you could say

743
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,940
macro phenomena at some point,

744
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,660
did you a very particular urban reality?

745
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:26,580
And what David Harvey then does,

746
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:30,860
and this is a kind of a short excuse that I want to take you through.

747
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:34,620
What it says, okay, in these competitive circumstances,

748
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,620
we see that policymakers start to adopt a number of things.

749
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:44,660
a number of strategies and a number of entrepreneurs strategies and I'll take you through them.

750
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:50,980
Be advised and sometimes it's kind of interesting to see that people think there's kind of some

751
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:56,980
kind of a recipe by David Harvey say if your citizen trouble please consider

752
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:02,660
applying this strategy this is not what David Harvey does he kind of observes and

753
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:08,500
analyses this phenomena he's not prescribing some kind of entrepreneurial strategies that

754
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,540
that should be implemented by policymakers,

755
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:15,220
just to be clear, which reminds me of an anecdote

756
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:19,380
that Harvey once gave a lecture in New York.

757
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:24,180
And he's famous for his analysis or reading

758
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:28,620
of Das Kapital by my son, Marx.

759
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,660
Volume one is a very nice video on that.

760
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,340
He has a companion to capital.

761
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:37,340
And he also gave a lecture about that somewhere in New York.

762
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:40,680
And apparently there were also some investment bankers

763
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,840
in the room.

764
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,620
And after the lecture, his investment bankers

765
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,740
walked up to women and said, well, Mr. Harvey,

766
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,680
I think you have a very good understanding

767
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,920
of how finance capital works.

768
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,860
Would it be possible to hire you as a consultant?

769
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,000
(audience laughs)

770
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,920
I think he declined, but yeah, just to be very clear.

771
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,140
I mean, it's an analysis that he provides.

772
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:05,600
It's not a recipe that he thinks

773
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,560
should be installed.

774
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,400
All right.

775
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,000
So yeah, I mean, the first kind of thing that

776
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,360
is under pressure, if you will, is these productive activities.

777
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,080
And what it sees is that some policymakers

778
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,400
still manage to kind of keep productive activities

779
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,080
in their territories.

780
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,560
And that means that still there will be some public

781
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,320
and private investments.

782
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,280
And you could say the physical and social base

783
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,960
or physical and social infrastructure

784
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,320
So think about knowledge networks, educational facilities,

785
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,600
try to do a Spanish recap.

786
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,880
So sometimes the state becomes some kind of venture

787
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,040
capitalist itself.

788
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,960
But indeed, as has been described,

789
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,240
also try to work on all the things that are too costly,

790
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:56,760
reduce excessive labor costs, for instance,

791
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,560
tax breaks, et cetera, et cetera.

792
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,160
And quite often leading the idea

793
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:06,560
is that the city regions should become silicon valleys,

794
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,560
that that should be the ambition,

795
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,000
that they should seek to attract capital people.

796
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,040
Sometimes this kind of set to attract creative class

797
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,240
to refer to which Florida.

798
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,280
But it's kind of this idea that yes,

799
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,640
a high tech productive city is still

800
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,200
imaginable and we have to create the right business

801
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,560
environment to get there.

802
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:35,200
So images of clusters and there's a lot of cluster policy,

803
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,040
but it used to be, I think, in a lot of cities.

804
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,800
It's also the reason why you had dedicated districts

805
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:45,800
at cities linked to healthcare or biotech, et cetera, et cetera.

806
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,120
So that's kind of one stretch,

807
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,360
Gida is still imaginable for cities.

808
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,040
A second entrepreneurial strategy

809
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,880
is to compete for consumption.

810
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,160
So people have money to spend.

811
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,480
There's a spatial division of consumption.

812
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,760
What you want is that people spend their dollars,

813
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:09,560
euros, rupees in your country and your city

814
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,360
and not in the neighborhood city.

815
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,400
And obviously with globalization,

816
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,440
this kind of changes, we see the emergence of global tourism,

817
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,120
flows, et cetera, et cetera.

818
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,000
So there's a kind of battle, if you will,

819
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,720
to attract tourists, retirees,

820
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,960
that is a whole economy behind elderly homes

821
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,320
because, well, these are people who have pensions still,

822
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,720
and they provide a safe stream of income,

823
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:39,720
and you can say local consumption activities.

824
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,600
Now, there's a contradiction in capitalism there

825
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,680
because with the crisis of Fordism,

826
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,920
we see a decline in purchasing power.

827
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,680
The factor labor is typically less powerful.

828
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:56,800
So yeah, there's less money to spend.

829
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:05,640
people don't really see an increase in their real wages, as we've seen in the picture,

830
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,440
on New York, but this goes back to the 1970s for the new

831
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:16,040
pictures of the US that has been hardly any increase in real wages, despite huge productivity

832
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,320
growth.

833
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:29,040
So this conundrum in many cases has been resolved by reverting to credit, basically.

834
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:35,560
So instead of buying it from the salary that you have, there's an increased financialization

835
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:41,840
of the economy in the sense that a lot of households become dependent on credit, mostly

836
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:49,920
through banks to obtain housing, but increasingly also all other kinds of consumption goods,

837
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:57,520
goods, washing machines, cars, etc., etc. So this is kind of one way of solving that contradiction.

838
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:06,160
It's also trying to attract high income jobs because yeah, they have a lot of money to spend

839
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,960
and what form does it take?

840
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,840
Well, in many cases, it will have some impact on the social spatial structure.

841
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:19,760
It could be either state-led gentrification, it could be market-based gentrification.

842
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:26,160
In many cases, what you will see is that cities will try to become more attractive one way or

843
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:33,120
another by using heritage, architecture, and these are things that you will also talk with

844
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,040
with bus about cities are quite a fence formed into these kind of urban spectacles that are

845
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:46,240
collectively adding more value in the goods that are consumed there. So if you walk around

846
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,800
in spectacular neighborhood, you might be inclined to spend a bit more. Yes.

847
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,800
[ Inaudible ]

848
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,800
Yes.

849

[ Inaudible ]

851
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,800
So, we'll increase the work of the city like one in a photograph

852
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,800
and I'm not going to see it.

853
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,800
Oh, yeah.

854
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,800
[ Inaudible ]

855
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,800
Yeah.

856

[ Inaudible ]

857
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,800
And there was no really an attraction in the off-grid.

858
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,800
- Oh, sorry.

859
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:27,800
- Yeah, no, but it's kind of these examples of landmark buildings.

860
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,800
They're quite often they're used in large-scale reconversion.

861
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,800
Number one is, I think maybe you refer to Bill Bow.

862
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
All right, that's northern Spain.

863
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,800
So there was an open industrial area,

864
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,800
and I think it's in the 1990s already.

865
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,800
Spectacular urbanism in the sense that spectacular architecture

866
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,440
a tech-led architecture.

867
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,680
Usually there's some kind of un-global class

868
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,520
of what they call start attacks,

869
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,440
who are kind of at an old house and Zaha did her.

870
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,180
She passed away now.

871
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:01,880
Who connected these global circuits

872
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:06,000
and starts producing these kind of spectacular architectural

873
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,880
forms that then send the message to the world,

874
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,640
which can be then linked to city branding

875
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,520
or city marketing strategies, et cetera.

876
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,840
So the city in and of itself can be consumed,

877
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:22,840
but also plays a role in fueling consumption practices

878
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,280
within.

879
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,480
So that's kind of, if you're interested to hire,

880
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,320
David Hargner for that, he can advise you how to do that.

881
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,080
And then the third one is what he says is that

882
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,720
there's still an element of the previous system there,

883
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,120
but it's kind of transformed.

884
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,640
So, and you could say,

885
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,640
for this engineering system, the state had a role to kind of stimulate growth.

886
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,200
It was still capitalist growth, for sure,

887
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,280
across the territory somewhat evenly.

888
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:56,320
So, yeah, there's, you could say, general taxation,

889
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,080
there's a fund and it can be invested across the territory.

890
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:04,720
And lower level governments can still try to attract

891
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,360
some of that funding.

892
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,520
But it becomes increasingly,

893
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:14,200
You can say marketised as well, quite often you'll be competing with other cities and other

894
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:20,840
regions to start to attract these kinds of redistributive funds.

895
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,760
Just an overview of examples in the US, it's about where are military and defense

896
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,760
investments being made?

897
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,160
That's the story of Silicon Valley.

898
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:37,520
Europe is a lot of competition between regions for, for instance, regional development

899
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:45,120
funds which work on both competitiveness of regions, but also cohesion.

900
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,360
So it's not 100% evil or something like that.

901
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:58,480
But it's a mechanism to redistribute these kind of investments across a territory,

902
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,760
but increase, you can say, the capacity of these places from growth.

903
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:07,760
And at the same time also work towards providing amenities, child care, etc.

904
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,760
People that are joining me on Friday, I'll say a little bit more about that.

905
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,360
And basically to Brussels, the canals of for instance is one of these

906
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,760
so interactions for the European regional development.

907
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,760
When you look for people that know flounders a little bit,

908
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,760
you have stops finneving spray actin urban renewal project.

909
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:39,760
It's kind of led by foreigners and it's basically giving money to cities to reconvert

910
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,760
in a city neighbourhood.

911
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:49,280
And quite often you have to apply either you say, "Okay, I'm going to hand in a concept

912
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,280
node."

913
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:55,280
So you get some funding to develop your idea and then perhaps if you're a successful

914
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,720
later on you can attract funding by the Flamish government.

915
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:05,820
Thus far you see that it's mostly the central city's center speed and so the main

916
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:11,240
agglomerations that have the main capacity also to apply for these funds.

917
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:16,960
So it's not that all small cities can actually benefit from that.

918
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,960
There was a question.

919
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:23,160
I just wanted to say looking at that the way it orders like, does that play a great

920
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,920
in the district of Eastern Park.

921
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,360
Like looking at most of my church in part

922
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,520
of the government church that I have,

923
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,520
they're all running down the street.

924
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,240
So they're all running?

925
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,360
Oh, oh, yeah.

926
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,200
Yeah, that's it.

927
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,840
I mean, it is just like the blood can of like,

928
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,920
it's our past, but really it's like making choices

929
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,600
about whatever--

930
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,400
Yeah, our kind of thing.

931
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,960
Yeah, who is going to pay for this in the future?

932
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,600
Yeah.

933
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,400
So there's a question, okay, governments don't have money, how can you be talking about

934
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,400
surplus?

935
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,640
I think what I'm talking about is the surplus that has been created in the economy, which

936
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:09,120
is not necessarily the same as the government budget, which is under conditions of what

937
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:13,600
I would hope for a new austerity is kept small.

938
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:19,520
And then the only thing that you can do is, yeah, okay, we're going to become more efficient.

939
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:26,640
And a mantra that you hear often will basically have very small cuts across the board.

940
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:34,960
So I think it used to be, say, more in the previous thread, especially to post-17, something

941
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:42,840
like that, that the allocation problem was smaller because the fiscal base was larger,

942
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:47,560
there was more economic growth, which could be more easily taxed.

943
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:54,680
out, you can say, hurting corporations or people or workers. It's only at the point where

944
01:16:54,680 --> 01:17:03,080
you can say, and yeah, there was a kind of stagnation of profits that it became very hard for

945
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:13,080
governments. Yeah, to how would I put this to maintain fiscal level without eating into the

946
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,880
the profits of the corporations that were still there.

947
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,880
So it's kind of a, yeah, it became a very awkward situation.

948
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,320
So they rather kind of cut back on expenditures,

949
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,480
running to increase, for instance, corporate tax rates.

950
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:33,040
So that could have been one way of dealing with that,

951
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:38,320
thinking about raising productivity levels in another way

952
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,960
by investing in technology, et cetera, et cetera.

953
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:46,480
that has happened to some extent, but it has merely answered across the board. I think the main,

954
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:55,840
I would say, trend was to keep the check on the wages of people. So yeah, this, when I talk about

955
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,240
surplus is kind of more what kind of wealth is created within the capitalist system,

956
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:08,160
rather than more in account, in terms of what the government runs a surplus or a benefit,

957
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,520
or a deficit, just to be clear there.

958
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:17,960
But yeah, despite the fact that even if there's

959
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,640
the smaller budgets available, also the allocation

960
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,080
mechanism has changed, it has become less

961
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:30,040
kind of an element of how would I put this managing

962
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,880
kind of growth across the territory,

963
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:35,600
it has become more of a competition really.

964
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,160
And you see, for instance, these urban renewal projects

965
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:42,480
and flowers, there's a competition to attract these funds

966
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,440
to your city.

967
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:48,720
And that's-- yeah, you see that it leads to some kind of--

968
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,520
when it takes a goal for an almond.

969
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,400
I mean, the planet's government is reflexive about that.

970
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,640
So it's not extreme that it's all to one city,

971
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,880
but still there's a tendency that some cities benefit a bit

972
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,840
more from that than others.

973
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:05,360
And that's always a tendency.

974
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,920
Yeah, I'm taking a lot of time.

975
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:12,240
Then the next kind of final one,

976
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:17,440
and then we kind of end the exchirs and go back to discussion

977
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,880
about command and control and role cities,

978
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,640
the kind of final strategy is to make sure

979
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,760
that in the international division of labor

980
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,040
in these global production networks and global financial

981
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,280
networks that you hold these functions of command and control.

982
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,920
And the state is a specific kind of entrepreneurialism.

983
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,720
Well, you're invest in physical connectivity,

984
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,960
digital connectivity nowadays.

985
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,400
Now you invest in, could say, supply side economics.

986
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,240
I've heard that a little bit.

987
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:54,000
So state of the art, districts, that's

988
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,920
there to attract international corporations

989
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,760
and see the federal and central business districts.

990
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,280
that what I mean with that, also invest in educating

991
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,440
the labor force, thinking about installing business

992
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,760
schools for instance in front of one of the leading financial

993
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:18,760
center in Germany, the university has its business school

994
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,760
financed by Deutsche Bank.

995
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,480
So there's lectures by people working at Deutsche Bank,

996
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:30,800
educating the new generation of critical social scientists.

997
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,000
Okay.

998
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,000
So, this kind of dynamic is particularly attaching itself to world cities and the kind of

999
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,080
idea is that if you attract these global functions, it will indeed set in motion some kind

1000
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,200
of a trickle down effect.

1001
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:52,240
It will inflate property prices because there will, as we have learned with bad prisoners,

1002
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:56,760
they become part of international portfolios, etc.

1003
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:02,280
So that's kind of the strategy that is set there.

1004
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:07,120
Okay, let's have a quick break, five minutes,

1005
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,640
and then we actually get to the polarization thesis,

1006
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,200
which is taking all the time today.

1007
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:18,320
Yeah, maybe if you want my last little bit.

1008
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,320

Okay, so we have this brief ex-curse learning about different

1114
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:13,960
entrepreneurial strategies, and I think what I wanted to show is that there's a wide

1115
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:19,680
restructuring of the economy, and we can place growing global city formation within that

1116
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,520
as one particular strategy, okay?

Or one particular process that is explicitly relevant for world cities.

1118
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:35,000
Going back a little bit more to the discussion about how does this connect with polarization?

1119
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Well, as we found there's this, and it's mostly treatment involved, treatment and

1120

testing.

1121
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:49,000
The starting point was this observation of a change in the economic base.

1122
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,600
Generally, the decline in well-paid manufacturing jobs, which is some kind of an exodus

1123
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:02,600
because of globalization of production, and at the same time a restructuring of the economy

1124
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:10,640
what services, as we have seen 80% of cities, is service-based, but it's both at the

1125
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:19,120
high end and at the low end, both formal services, service markers and informal service.

1126
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:24,360

01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:53,360
Please do a leaf roll.

1131
01:30:53,360 --> 01:31:00,080
So there's something particular about these APS and headquarters economies that will set

1132
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,600
in motion polarization, okay?

1133
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:09,680
So at one point this, you can say competition within the APM and the APS complex itself,

1134
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:16,560
which will lead to an idea of outsourcing, getting rid of some kind of long-core activities.

1135
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:25,240
quite often leads to low-key kind of activities that are all and a lot of context also

1136
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:32,240
linked to some form of informal economy and a lot of migrant labor that takes care of

1137
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:40,840
routine service jobs. Think about community functions, think about, well, the Xerox machine

1138
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:43,960
and those kind of things, clerical work, etc.

1139
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:51,300
Next to that, what you also see is that with these high end functions, or these command

1140
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:59,440
and control functions, it comes with the influx of well-selling people that have a lot

1141
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:06,800
of the spending power, that have their own desire for forms of housing, quite often this

1142
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:14,240
sets in motion process of gentrification, so the displacement of initial populations.

1143
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:19,800
And it's also at the level of consumption and growth of leisure activities that this needs

1144
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:20,800
to transformation.

1145
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:27,080
Okay, so if you host these activities, basically the managers, the CEOs, people in business

1146
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:31,760
service, just advanced producer services, well, they have the whole ecology of control

1147
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:41,120
amenities and hortic arts etc. So this also creates some kind of demand for low-income jobs

1148
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:49,280
to cater quite literally to these elites. There is something particular about world cities

1149
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:56,560
which makes that there will be an even more augmented process of polarization compared to

1150
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:01,560
normal cities or wider territories.

1151
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,520
And the end result, the idea is that you get with,

1152
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,640
you get a different structure or income distribution

1153
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,760
in the sense that there's a lot of growth of jobs

1154
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:18,200
at the very top, there's a growth of jobs at the bottom

1155
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,080
of income distribution.

1156
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,960
And in general, because of the decline in one page

1157
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:27,280
all remunerated stable manufacturing jobs,

1158
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,320
there's a kind of a decrease of middle income groups

1159
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,680
and you end up with an hourglass, okay?

1160
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,200
So something like that, okay?

1161
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:40,360
That one, this kind of figure shows how that works.

1162
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,440
It's a bit hard to decide for here,

1163
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,360
but there's the growth of M,

1164
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,840
which is a part of managerial class.

1165
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:53,200
So CEOs of international corporations

1166
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,760
Link to that is P is a kind of the producer services

1167
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,480
or the long business services that we're

1168
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,960
going to be talking about.

1169
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,160
Then below that, C is all kinds of terrible tasks.

1170
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,440
OK.

1171
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:10,600
Minial tasks and kind of taking care of administration,

1172
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,960
such as et cetera.

1173
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,640
In the current day and age, these activities

1174
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,400
are also kind of being localized and off-shore,

1175
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,920
and of themselves, the 1980s, that their back office

1176
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:24,920
works still to place in global cities.

1177
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:28,360
So at the same time, you say, a growth,

1178
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:32,440
you say, in informal markets or informal parts of the economy.

1179
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:39,680
And these are often also based on, on micro play.

1180
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:46,760
For instance, what I have here, I mean, all these kind of amenities

1181
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:50,080
that we're talking about, Hordika,

1182
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:53,280
leisure activities, kind of support by that.

1183
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:57,160
There's informal production facilities

1184
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,080
that are re-emerging in cities.

1185
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,560
And then, yeah, the assumption moves and other kinds of things

1186
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,880
that are also emerging there in connection

1187
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:12,320
to the rise of this APS complex and global corporation.

1188
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,520
So in general, what you need to remember

1189
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:22,160
is you have an exodus of these high wage manufacturing jobs, that's what kind of is the main

1190
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:32,000
infrastructure and a kind of influx of workers often from a global scale of foreign migrant workers

1191
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:39,840
that quite often end up in informal labor markets. No that I still have this one, you don't mind how

1192
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,640
So a general structure of this labor market and importantly and what sets

1193
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:53,280
more than global cities apart from you could say. Rest of the territory or small cities

1194
01:35:53,280 --> 01:36:00,480
is that this labor market becomes globalized. And it speaks, you say, both sides of this

1195
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:09,680
hourglass that works at the top level, we have the high-paid migrants and it works also at the lower

1196
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,680
of income distribution.

1197
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:14,680
And quite interestingly,

1198
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:17,680
sometimes quite cynically,

1199
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,680
there's also different terminologies for that.

1200
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,680
So people at the high end,

1201
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,680
it doesn't really matter

1202
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,680
or they're kind of not seen as immigrants,

1203
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,680
but these are expats.

1204
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,680
Quite often, for instance, in Belgium,

1205
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,680
they enjoy quite interesting text regimes.

1206
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,680
This is the day this question has to,

1207
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:38,680
whether it would be a nice idea to actually text expats

1208
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:46,880
that's in Belgium. So these are kind of seen as people that bring in a lot of

1209
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:53,920
expertise, a lot of value that make a city very competitive in this global war

1210
01:36:53,920 --> 01:37:01,280
for talent whereas people that are for us in the lower paid jobs by seen as

1211
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,720
immigrants, right, or foreigners, etc.

1212
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:12,000
Okay, so there's a lot of terms that are being used there that are take part of very

1213
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,140
performative and normalizing the situation.

1214
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:24,880
So the way we talk about these divisions matters, I think.

1215
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:37,960
So what we see is also a growth of low-skilled or these skills, migrant workers.

1216
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:45,560
So either people that have middle-ableification in the country of origin and come to a world

1217
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:50,480
of global city or people that have qualifications.

1218
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:57,280
for some reason because they cross the border have lost proof of that. So a lot of

1219
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:03,680
contacts, even if you're educated in one or one in the other direction, you have to

1220
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:09,680
kind of be accredited for that. So you have to, your diploma needs to be certified to be

1221
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:15,680
able to access the labor market in one way or another. In and of itself, it's quite an

1222
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:22,960
interesting process, but it means that a lot of people, especially in informal migration,

1223
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:28,480
not being in the position to actually do that. So they may have all kinds of skills, but they

1224
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:34,720
can't formally use them. So this is kind of the first of these scaling that is going on. Now,

1225
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:40,480
what it creates, especially in the place where you have a wall of immigration, that's typically

1226
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:47,600
world in global cities. It just creates a very large pool of people that have a very poor,

1227
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:56,000
you can say that are not really empowered, that don't have a bargain power to negotiate about their

1228
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:03,200
wages. And if they don't do it well somebody else will. And this kind of the notion of a reserve

1229
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:11,280
army of labor, a lot of people that are in flux that will basically take any job.

1230
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:17,160
And you see in that case, you see the emergence of what people call 3D jobs, dirty demanding

1231
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:20,480
and dangerous or dirty dangers and difficult.

1232
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:29,600
A lot of migrant labor in Roman drug cities ends up in these kind of segments.

1233
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:37,360
And these are typically jobs that people, that kind of the natives, if you will, are willing

1234
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,360
to do.

1235
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:47,400
And I mean, Chris, if you look at the whole debate about the fallout of Brexit, it had

1236
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:55,160
been driven tremendously while in anti-immigrant, they are stealing our jobs sentiment.

1237
01:39:55,160 --> 01:40:03,080
now that the economy is kind of crippled by not having access to fuel because there's no truck

1238
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:09,640
drivers to actually or migrant truck drivers to actually bring the fuel to to pump stations,

1239
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:17,080
gas stations, where you can refill your car. So it's kind of history with the vengeance there

1240
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:24,680
and it kind of shows the crucial dependence of our economy in a lot of cities on that migrant

1241
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:31,680
and a lot of essential services that is absolutely undervalued in societal terms.

1242
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:42,680
Yeah, and then what is actually quite interesting to see in it's also work by Farskya Susson

1243
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:47,680
when she was still married as Susson Group.

1244
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:55,680
Yeah, a lot of these activities are informal or connected to floating populations, people that are

1245
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:05,680
residing temporarily in cities that may be trans migrants move on when we're not doing.

1246
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:11,680
And yeah, they form the context of, you could say, potential exploitation.

1247
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:16,680
It's not necessarily happening, but it's kind of a context where people that want to take advantage

1248
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:20,600
advantage can more easily do that.

1249
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:26,160
It can be sometimes for very good reasons,

1250
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:29,480
say, OK, I want to help somebody.

1251
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:34,400
And I'll let you lose my house or take care of the children.

1252
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:39,240
And I'll pay you the minimum wage or something like that.

1253
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:43,640
That could be the position of a middle class family

1254
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,200
in a global city,

1255
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,200
but at the same time,

1256
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,880
there's this structural discrimination

1257
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,440
of these groups in society.

1258
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,320
They may be well suited to take other jobs in society,

1259
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,360
but yeah, they're kind of forced into them.

1260
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,120
So it's kind of in combination with a large group of people

1261
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,600
that are looking for jobs,

1262
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:08,920
the informal character allows a lot of informal potential forms

1263
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:11,560
of exploitation.

1264
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,880
And this is what Khos, the parapherilization at the core.

1265
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,380
So what she says is that, typically we think about exploitation

1266
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:23,840
as a relation between the global north or the global south.

1267
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,640
Actually it's taking place.

1268
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,520
It re-enters the global north.

1269
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:29,960
So in rural and global cities, you can also

1270
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:35,560
find this, these exploitative relations

1271
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:41,440
because the global south is actually living in world

1272
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:46,880
and global cities that have raised the relation remains exploited.

1273
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,400
Okay, so the racial realization of the core.

1274
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,600
Just to figure to illustrate this,

1275
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,000
is to refer a little bit to research on this.

1276
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
So as a whole strand of research looking into urban belief networks,

1277
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,640
some kind of interesting work with him Carol looking

1278
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:08,000
at interlocking direct rates.

1279
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:20,240
it's one way of measuring the connections between cities by looking at the overlaps between

1280
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:27,520
the board of directors of board of directors of board of directors. So one member of the board

1281
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:35,600
sitting on different boards. So for instance, for this bunk Belgium and B&D buddy buff

1282
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:41,440
Paris or something like that. And we see actually in this picture there's quite a strong

1283
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:49,120
connection between Brussels and Paris, but it shows that as we live in a kind of global economy,

1284
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:56,960
the corporate world has globalized. There's also the social structure there behind that of a

1285
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:02,640
traveling global elite with a lot of power decision-making power that is connecting

1286
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:08,560
and this kind of place. So if you're a board of directors of, and the board of directors,

1287
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:18,320
ten or 15 corporations, well you will be, you say traveling around in first class between these places

1288
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:28,000
and go from Citadel to Citadel. Okay. I also did a little bit of research into how this looks

1289
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,640
and Islamic markets and I found actually quite similar things. The geographies look different,

1290
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:40,880
but what I hope that is how governance structures work is. Islamic banks,

1291
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:45,040
and there you find that next to the typical board of directors,

1292
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:52,720
they also have a Sharia board and these boards basically review and what extent the activities of banks

1293
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:59,680
are in line with the shayya. So are they hollow or are they not a

1294
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:00,320
participant?

1295
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:09,760
It's hollow. And yeah, it's very similar to what I found in the previous figure in the sense that

1296
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:16,240
it's also very concentrated social geography. So it's very concentrated in a very limited set of

1297
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:25,360
scholars, some of them sit on the board, 50 different corporations, which creates

1298
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:29,760
all kinds of interesting things as to to what extent is this so credible that they

1299
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:35,360
will review the share with the compliant character or other things going on.

1300
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:44,800
You see there's a connection with New York. Well at some point, go in sex also was planning to

1301
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:52,160
to go into Islamic markets and there was a whole controversy as to what extends their financial

1302
01:45:52,160 --> 01:46:00,720
product was actually reviewed by Sharia scholars or whether this was some kind of a religious

1303
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:10,880
effort, etc. There was a huge lashback by Sharia scholars, by this entire community and

1304
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,320
in the end of the materialized.

1305
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:15,320
But just to show you that there's different ways

1306
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,920
of approaching these networks,

1307
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,800
but it's the existence of those kind of structures

1308
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,080
that allows us to understand what kind of activity

1309
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:27,680
state plays at that level and how you can effect

1310
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:29,520
say income structure,

1311
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,000
because they're extremely well-remunerated

1312
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,840
and will reside in different kinds of places.

1313
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,280
Now at the other end,

1314
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:59,280
what I was talking about is these new forms of industrial exploitation in these sweatshops. So yeah, what are these kind of sweatshops? You may have heard of that kind of the renaissance of very old forms of exploitation or industrial organization.

1315
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,640
You may have heard about in Middle East,

1316
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:07,840
you have the putting out system where people in the household and in the countryside

1317
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:17,760
were actually producing at a peace-by-peace salary textiles for capitalists and cities.

1318
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:22,320
It's kind of reinvented in the 20th and 21st century.

1319
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:26,880
So, flat shops are these small units, usually underground,

1320
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:31,880
or in secluded spaces, often in a text that industry,

1321
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:36,400
that works through all these kind of subcontracting deals.

1322
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:40,320
So you never quite know who is really hiring people.

1323
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:44,520
So there's different kind of layers of governance there.

1324
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:48,320
And a lot of people, yeah, are indeed paid by the piece

1325
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:52,280
or have daily or weekly contracts,

1326
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:56,320
which is extremely precarious as you may understand.

1327
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:01,320
And yeah, we see that it's kind of the emerge.

1328
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,920
And it was, say, the 19th century.

1329
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:09,320
It took place in a lot of industrializing cities.

1330
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:13,800
It went away and, for instance, in the US,

1331
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:18,480
you see that because there was all kind of trade unions,

1332
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:23,440
initiatives, regulations were adapted.

1333
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:32,160
for instance in relation to the new deal just before the second world war, which made

1334
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:38,600
this practically impossible. So it was in a context where you had far less migrant labor

1335
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:45,520
where actually possible to regulate those markets. But as kind of return to the 1990s, this

1336
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:53,160
kind of all of a sudden is back. These are very old data but in the 1990s, calculated I think

1337
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:58,840
between 4500 and 4500, 7000 textile companies

1338
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,040
there and then in New York, actually, sweatshows.

1339
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:04,960
So, you think about world's deformation,

1340
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:10,800
it's not just these glitz and glam offices with bankers.

1341
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,360
At the same time, it's very old forms of exploitation

1342
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:19,040
that are made possible by complete absence

1343
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:23,840
of any labor rights protection.

1344
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,860
So yeah, the places in China down at the lower east

1345
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:33,520
and these kind of situations are still occurring.

1346
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:41,520
Now, then to turn a little bit to I would say criticism

1347
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,360
or critiques of the polarization thesis,

1348
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:47,840
because it seems to be a very kind of elegant thesis

1349
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,440
right as the restructuring of the economy.

1350
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,360
At the same time there's globalization.

1351
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,600
It leads to the traction of headquarters

1352
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,440
in APS functions.

1353
01:49:57,440 --> 01:50:00,040
And this kind of adds to a wider process

1354
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,680
of income and professional polarization,

1355
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:05,960
which then they also leads to social spatial polarization.

1356
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:08,400
Because people, but different kind of income groups,

1357
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:11,120
may not necessarily live in the same places.

1358
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:14,080
Quite on the contrary, if they have very different lifestyles,

1359
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,920
they may want to live something else.

1360
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:23,480
The same time also the empirical base is mostly linked to a limited set of cases in

1361
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:25,720
York, London, Tokyo.

1362
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:35,160
So especially in 1990s when this became a major debate, the question is is Susson right

1363
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:41,240
or is Susson wrong to put it in the words of Chris Hamlet, who is also one of you sitting

1364
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:44,160
in counterforces in this debate.

1365
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,600
So for instance according to Hamnet,

1366
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:49,560
yeah, it's very critical of this full organization

1367
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,360
as we also briefly discussed before.

1368
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:55,680
It says, well, it's an all purpose general signifier.

1369
01:50:55,680 --> 01:51:01,320
And in the end, yeah, it doesn't really explain much

1370
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,560
and we don't necessarily need to describe

1371
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:07,640
what is going on in particular world cities.

1372
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:11,200
So what he says is that next to polarization,

1373
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:15,240
This whole process is thinking, right?

1374
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:18,040
We can think about a proletarianization,

1375
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:20,240
so that's the emergence of, say,

1376
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:24,240
an exploited underclass, if you will,

1377
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:27,680
to use that term in society as the main trend,

1378
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,560
or it could also be professionalization,

1379
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:33,040
which somehow refers to social mobility,

1380
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:37,200
the rise of middle income jobs, et cetera, et cetera.

1381
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:40,600
So instead of assuming that world and global city

1382
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:44,480
information necessarily reduces polarization.

1383
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:47,560
It's actually a research question, empirical question,

1384
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:50,480
what is going on in cities?

1385
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:55,480
So rather than just saying, OK, this is a disease

1386
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:57,840
or a given fact.

1387
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,560
It may be a hypothesis to see to what extent

1388
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:04,600
we see evidence of polarization or whether we see

1389
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,520
other things.

1390
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,920
And one thing of doing that is also

1391
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,320
taking more into account the occupational structure

1392
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:15,120
and the spatial structure of cities.

1393
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:20,200
So to tell a bit more about this occupational structure,

1394
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,960
what it talks about this hamlet,

1395
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,760
and this is kind of an interesting evolution.

1396
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:30,760
In the 1990s, he mostly looked at the case of London.

1397
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:35,760
And he says, well, what we find in New York,

1398
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:40,120
I'm not necessarily find that in the case of London.

1399
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:42,520
There's actually very little polarization

1400
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,920
what I find is professionalization.

1401
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:50,000
So yes, there's a growth of high income jobs,

1402
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,440
but it's not necessarily linked to an explosion

1403
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,720
of jobs at the bottom.

1404
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:58,480
So it's not really an hour to us.

1405
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,600
At the same time, we also see evidence

1406
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:03,840
of a growth in middle income jobs.

1407
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:10,320
And a lot of people can move up, you could say,

1408
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:14,760
the occupational structure can be trained,

1409
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:22,280
can get a training, and are professionalizing.

1410
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:27,760
So yeah, he doesn't find the pattern of what

1411
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:32,240
seemed to be the two expected pattern of New York.

1412
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,560
That same time, he says, well, it could

1413
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:42,040
be related to the fact that migration is there and then far less the case.

1414
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:46,280
It's also incomparable to what you find in New York.

1415
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:52,440
So you had migration obviously to London, but it was less globalized.

1416
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:58,000
It was mostly a link to you can say to the dreadnits of empire,

1417
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,760
but it wasn't of the scale of what you found in New York.

1418
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:06,280
And silly says, yeah, there's also a much more general,

1419
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:11,400
well-frest date where you compare it to what you can do.

1420
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:15,080
So let us just, OK, let's not exaggerate.

1421
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:17,040
We don't really find polarization.

1422
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:22,480
Other pathways are actually thinkable.

1423
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:28,440
And then what we actually find in such context

1424
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:33,320
that it might be something that kind of more intersects

1425
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:38,320
with, you could say, process of privilege

1426
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:44,200
that intersects with gender, roles in society

1427
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:45,280
and ethnicity.

1428
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:49,760
So it's less the whole discussion about, yes,

1429
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:54,760
this APS complex that start to transform into a labor market.

1430
01:54:54,760 --> 01:55:00,400
Now it's actually wider dimensions of gender and ethnic

1431
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:05,240
languages in society that will explain what we find in labor markets.

1432
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:09,240
So friends as well by Susan, Fangstein, and colleagues,

1433
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:17,240
they look at the exclusion by female labor in high end jobs.

1434
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:23,040
Or friends as the work by John Wilson, John May and colleagues.

1435
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:28,040
If we got one of the first may of the co-author is,

1436
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:32,320
is this okay, look, we have to look much more

1437
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:34,520
at necessity to understand what is going on

1438
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:38,680
because for instance, one third of London's

1439
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:41,480
for the Pina population is actually

1440
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,920
in health and social care.

1441
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:45,400
Brazilians are in cleaning services.

1442
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:52,000
Sick are hired as security guards,

1443
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:58,720
majority guards, a jereons are running the metro system, etc. etc. etc.

1444
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:04,760
So, these kind of more general processes will tell us much more about what is going on.

1445
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:12,240
Now, what we find is that when you start looking at more recent work at London, is that

1446
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:19,880
this whole argument that that long as somehow exclude or protect it from processes of

1447
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:23,760
All theization doesn't really seem to hold.

1448
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:24,760
Yep, there's a question.

1449
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:28,320
- I'm doing the question.

1450
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:31,320
There are the scores for our game

1451
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:36,000
that was known increased in lower intervals.

1452
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,800
They tried to also include one formal,

1453
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:43,800
yeah, the general point or something.

1454
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:46,920
- I think that's one of the reasons,

1455
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,240
that's a very good point.

1456
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:51,360
And I think that's one of the differences between,

1457
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:54,760
for instance, the work of May and colleagues

1458
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:58,560
and the conclusions by Chris Hamditz

1459
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:03,040
who is focusing on formal occupational structures.

1460
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,440
So indeed, that's the first point,

1461
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:08,120
mythological question, is this basically

1462
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,760
resolved with the data that is being used?

1463
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:13,600
And actually what you find is that

1464
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:16,660
in the article that was in the reader,

1465
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:18,420
which is a way more recent one.

1466
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:22,460
He also admits that process of polarization

1467
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:24,340
are going on and long.

1468
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:26,100
Okay, so it's kind of,

1469
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:29,980
he has seen the lights, Chris Hemmott.

1470
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:32,140
And that's kind of, yeah,

1471
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:33,980
I just referring to this paper.

1472
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:36,060
It's kind of very interesting paper

1473
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:37,440
because it's really targets

1474
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:41,220
migrant groups here in the sense that they look

1475
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:45,500
at regulation and kind of jobs

1476
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:50,500
that are being done by people that typically are not part of official statistics.

1477
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:58,500
And yeah, it's kind of hard to draw conclusions from that and say, okay,

1478
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,500
for instance, if you look at this picture,

1479
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:05,500
this kind of showing the division across different kind of

1480
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:17,500
So they collected responses by over 300 people in informal markets.

1481
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:26,500
Yeah, you find that only 9% actually earns the living wage.

1482
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:34,500
So it really shows that there's an overlay between the environment labor and

1483
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,300
or working conditions.

1484
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:39,800
But at the same time, it doesn't give you an overview

1485
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:41,700
of the entire structure of the labor market.

1486
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:45,780
So it's kind of a con-draw systemic conclusion from that.

1487
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:48,780
But if you've seen these compare it to this kind of picture,

1488
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:53,860
which is not about income, but there's about job equality.

1489
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:58,620
So it's a very rough marker of, you can say, yeah,

1490
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:02,540
where in the social hierarchy or occupational hierarchy

1491
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:03,900
are we at?

1492
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:06,100
There you see that there's actually a growth

1493
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:09,980
in the kind of the shitty jobs, if you will,

1494
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:16,340
a stagnation between the drive of normal decent jobs

1495
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:19,060
and a large growth at the top.

1496
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:21,980
So in these kind of indicators that the

1497
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:23,740
with occupational structure,

1498
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:27,660
it's counter evidence towards the profession andization.

1499
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,620
So I think what happens here is that

1500
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:38,820
When Chris Hamlet was writing his argument against Sussman in the 1990s, it may have still been true.

1501
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:47,860
It may have been biased by looking at formal statistics, not capturing what was going on

1502
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:54,020
at the bottom because it was basically part of the informal economy. But then even with that,

1503
01:59:54,820 --> 02:00:01,620
As time has passed the picture even in the form of market which is no longer lower as he would have described it.

1504
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:10,420
So it's kind of a process of restructuring that has only been initiated later, I think, compared to to North North.

1505
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:17,220
Okay, but in any case, I think it's also not necessarily the same way.

1506
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:24,220
to say, okay, Susson is right or Hamlet is wrong.

1507
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:28,540
Point is that we have to identify different processes

1508
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,540
that can actually take place at the same time.

1509
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:34,540
So you can imagine ant polarization and professionalization

1510
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:35,460
at the same time.

1511
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:38,260
It's not because you see polarization

1512
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:41,500
that some segments of the population

1513
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:44,660
actually undergo social mobility.

1514
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:46,820
In fact, it could actually be quite interesting question

1515
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:49,460
in the context of polarization,

1516
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:52,900
who is still able to improve oneself on the labor market

1517
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,740
and who is not.

1518
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:57,100
So I think that for me was kind of the gist

1519
02:00:57,100 --> 02:01:02,100
of the article by Chris Hamlet's there.

1520
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:06,020
Okay, let me move on because again, running out of time.

1521
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:10,420
So yeah, looking more closely at the occupational structure,

1522
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:14,460
I can't possibly go beyond that,

1523
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:17,180
that it gives you a hint of what to look for.

1524
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:19,660
Second element is spatial structure, right?

1525
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:22,180
So a very important critique principle

1526
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:26,660
is using the same steam is to what extent

1527
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:29,740
are the result of polarization?

1528
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:32,300
It is also a statistical artifact.

1529
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:37,060
There's a lot of focus on cities,

1530
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:38,380
but we at the same time,

1531
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:41,860
we know that middle classes have been suburbanizing

1532
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:44,060
or are still suburbanizing.

1533
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:48,740
So maybe this whole disappearance of a metal income

1534
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:50,820
jobs from cities and the fact that you

1535
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:53,060
end up with a very polarized labor market,

1536
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:56,900
it could be some kind of an artifact.

1537
02:01:56,900 --> 02:02:00,420
So yeah, I think that's something to take into account.

1538
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:02,820
That's also quite interesting to compare,

1539
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:06,740
you could say differences between what we did in New York

1540
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:09,100
State versus New York City.

1541
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:12,700
I think you can't say that there's no general trend

1542
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:18,540
kind of in decline of middle income jobs for instance in the case of the US.

1543
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:24,880
But it's perhaps less accentuated than if you only look at the very need city

1544
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:30,020
center. So there's always an impossibility that wealth is suburbanized and

1545
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:34,600
would give you a different question. So scale matters, space matters in the

1546
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:39,780
sense that you have to be aware that you need to kind of map the appropriate

1547
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:43,140
and metropolitan area to turn the stance

1548
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:45,100
the entire structure of the labor market.

1549
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:46,500
Okay.

1550
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:49,260
Now, yeah, and there it can go many ways

1551
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:51,020
in sense that you also have to be sensitive

1552
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:56,020
to what extent you say these higher incomes

1553
02:02:56,020 --> 02:02:57,500
will drive gentrification.

1554
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:02,180
There has been a whole process of moving out of cities,

1555
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:04,940
but there's also been a return to the city.

1556
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:07,260
When you take a city like Brussels,

1557
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:11,820
I think I would say, it's around to be a doubt that has been a return of middle incomes.

1558
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:17,500
And a lot of places, really leading world cities, has been of the super rich,

1559
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:24,140
setting a motion process of what Loretta Lee's calls super gentrification.

1560
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:31,180
And just one example of that is, and I refer to that on the map, Brooklyn used to be, you could say,

1561
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:41,020
a nice suburb of New York, just across the river, which was still affordable.

1562
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:48,060
You can put it on these brown stones, but what she described is how actually the top

1563
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:56,460
earners in New York are increasingly buying in these property markets.

1564
02:03:56,460 --> 02:04:03,460
So we see that almost half of all Brooklyn was owned by the top 10%.

1565
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:11,860
In that period, you see it tremendous growth and orientation of property values in that period.

1566
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:19,060
So you really have to look at the detailed level within a city how you could say these higher incomes.

1567
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:25,560
Yeah, what kind of spatial process they set in motion and sometimes at least here is a classification.

1568
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:29,480
in a city neighborhoods, and maybe more peripheral processes, etc.

1569
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:33,240
So there's no unified spatial structure there.

1570
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:38,520
It's just a question if we have a structure of the economy.

1571
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:41,160
Where does it specially attaches itself?

1572
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:42,360
OK.

1573
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:47,480
Another example is for instance Brussels, where we find that,

1574
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:52,040
I could say, raw city formation and buses often,

1575
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:56,760
Europeanization of the economy and all kind of functions that are laid to that,

1576
02:04:56,760 --> 02:05:01,160
how it has kind of reinforced existing social spatial divides.

1577
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:05,880
And this is work by, and now, a Middle-to-S professor from K.

1578
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:13,400
You live in the discussative group who looked at the evolution of,

1579
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:19,080
you can say, migrant populations and expect populations, sorry for that divide again.

1580
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:25,040
but it's being used in reality in Brussels.

1581
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:29,680
And what you see is that you could say typically the population

1582
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:35,960
with a lower income, the Moroccan population has grown

1583
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:44,640
in the western part of the city area, which is called the Puso

1584
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:49,640
the poor crescent, which is kind of the leading imaginary

1585
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:52,140
there, also with policymakers.

1586
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:55,140
Whereas you can take real Europeanization,

1587
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:59,840
has attracted a lot of expats, mostly Americans,

1588
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:04,840
and other kind of people from the European Union,

1589
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:10,240
mostly settled in the south eastern part of Brussels.

1590
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:15,840
And what Krskastalop explains is that in this geography,

1591
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:20,840
it's kind of reproducing early rounds of division in Brussels.

1592
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:24,840
And then it's kind of no coincidence that

1593
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:29,840
people with a Moroccan ethnicity and the northwest

1594
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:33,840
has something to do with the wider process of migrant labor,

1595
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:37,840
guest labor from the 1950s and '60s.

1596
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:45,120
I can say a lot about that, but the bottom line is, Belgian government actually went to Morocco,

1597
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:53,920
but also Turkey recently to really, you can say, brand Belgium as the place to work.

1598
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:58,280
A lot of migrant workers brought their families.

1599
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:01,440
They were seen as temporary guest workers.

1600
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:06,560
The entities people decided, yes, we were going to build a family here.

1601
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:11,080
And he actually worked in all kinds of productive activities and Brussels.

1602
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:16,680
Who went across the 1960s, '70s?

1603
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:23,120
And so you could say globalization of production also had a huge impact on these kind of jobs.

1604
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:29,920
A lot of these migrant workers were faced with structural employment and were kind of locked

1605
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:32,800
in into these situations.

1606
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:35,960
And yeah, never really got out of there.

1607
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:42,880
So there's still a large unemployment rate.

1608
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:49,520
And what we find is that with the restructuring of the economy, just at the time when

1609
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:55,920
new jobs were being created, there were the jobs that were not really matching the profile

1610
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:56,920
of these casework.

1611
02:07:56,920 --> 02:08:01,080
So there was a lot of service work.

1612
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:08,680
Yeah, I mean it's required training which was not necessarily offered to make that transition within one generation.

1613
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:14,760
So that's why you kind of see this kind of pattern reproduce.

1614
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:19,240
So the argument by this cast of all this that we should really look also into

1615
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:24,520
looking at the continuities in these spatial structures.

1616
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:31,760
The friends also find that in contemporary elite geographies of pipe, continuing a little

1617
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:38,440
bit, the work by Chris Castel, but then focusing on the upper stratum, if you will.

1618
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:46,360
We looked at cultural patronage activities, which is basically a method to identify people

1619
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:52,160
doing a lot of money or they think about themselves as being distinct by consuming the

1620
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:56,160
high-end cultural activity. So we basically went to La Monde,

1621
02:08:56,160 --> 02:09:00,160
Chapel,

1622
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:10,160
but it's again, Eliza Betz, it is a bit. So you have all kinds of high-brow cultural activities

1623
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:15,160
and Brussels. They've been played. We also went to Buzza, which tried to identify,

1624
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:21,160
who is actually on the big friend list, who is sponsoring this high-end cultural

1625
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:23,400
and cultural institutions.

1626
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:27,320
I mean, these are not kind of super spectacular.

1627
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:29,280
- I think sometimes we find it's kind of,

1628
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:30,680
it become a big fan of Bazaar.

1629
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:34,120
I think it was 12,500 euros per year.

1630
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:36,200
So it's not kind of just,

1631
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:37,520
but it's not the same time,

1632
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:40,360
it's not something that you could spend

1633
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,560
on a normal salary.

1634
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:45,600
So you, that was kind of used as a kind of criterion

1635
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:48,800
to kind of find a group that has both,

1636
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,120
you could say cultural capital.

1637
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:56,080
also economic. What we found then is that another is actually quite interesting that to

1638
02:09:56,080 --> 02:10:01,600
these kind of methods you could actually identify the grid, these people live. We actually

1639
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:10,800
in Buzz and I took our bikes and then the pictures that were actually at the port level and

1640
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:15,760
then the firework where the leads were living. We find kind of interesting clustering there

1641
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:22,720
and it's all very much concentrated in actually in the city neighborhood. So most of the kind of

1642
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:31,520
roads led to this kind of area of the east, Breckman and those kind of areas. So we identified

1643
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:38,560
that our leads are very urban, if you will, and the other place was kind of more suburban,

1644
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:45,600
still within the Russell's capital region with Spipula, which is more like a Vulong neighborhood,

1645
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:50,600
But, and that's kind of distinct way of life.

1646
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:53,480
But it's kind of interesting that the major,

1647
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:57,040
say segregation process that you find in terms of

1648
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:59,840
gave it communities and those kind of things,

1649
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:03,640
this is not something that you easily find in Brussels.

1650
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:06,880
These things exist in Brussels, but it's not,

1651
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:11,880
yeah, it's not the Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro

1652
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:12,720
or these kind of things.

1653
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:17,720
It's really happening by micro mechanisms at the plot level

1654
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:21,360
that this kind of segregation is going on.

1655
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:25,920
Now, just those were just a few examples

1656
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:30,440
to take into account histories of spatial structure

1657
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:32,120
that name matter.

1658
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:35,280
Now, drawing it to a close, I think what I want to say

1659
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:38,480
is that, yeah, how to explain,

1660
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,940
You can say inequality polarization, et cetera,

1661
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:44,300
I think we'll let that polarization

1662
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:47,840
is just one way of one outcome of this process

1663
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,740
is we need some kind of analytical or explanatory model

1664
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:53,140
for that.

1665
02:11:53,140 --> 02:11:56,900
And I want to draw on the work that must be here.

1666
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:58,380
For fun, it's still quite interesting,

1667
02:11:58,380 --> 02:12:00,900
because they work in kind of three ways.

1668
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:03,660
It's like, look, there's at the macro level,

1669
02:12:03,660 --> 02:12:05,180
a level of global change.

1670
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:07,580
The economy in general, as we structure,

1671
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:12,580
could be financializing this new international division of labor, etc.

1672
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:14,580
So that's happening at the macro level.

1673
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:20,580
There's also at the individual level, due to personal characteristics, choices, etc.

1674
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:26,580
Veterans have its sculptures. You may have different kinds of labor market opportunities.

1675
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:34,580
There's a lot of noise there. It's hard to study in a systematic way, but we need to acknowledge that.

1676
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:41,620
But what is kind of interesting is how the macro and the micro kind of connected by this medium level level of analysis

1677
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:46,360
Because it's kind of the interface between global process and local process

1678
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:48,420
So we can think about how

1679
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:52,120
nicity, gender and those kind of things will structure

1680
02:12:52,120 --> 02:12:58,740
Access to the labor market and positionality in the labor market as that labor market is being structured

1681
02:12:58,740 --> 02:13:01,500
You have to acknowledge national differences

1682
02:13:02,620 --> 02:13:06,020
We talked about the rise of new liberalization.

1683
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:09,540
It hasn't materialized in the same way

1684
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:12,420
or at the same time in different kind of spaces.

1685
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:14,820
There's a large difference still between more,

1686
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:19,620
it's a social democratic or at least

1687
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:23,220
light versions of social democracy.

1688
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:29,420
Winston Continental Europe compared to the UK or the US.

1689
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:39,420
So in continental Europe in many places, there's still white, solid social security system,

1690
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:41,420
minimum wages, etc.

1691
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:46,540
And we kind of identified these are crucial elements in explaining

1692
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:52,420
product for Florida. Oh my god, proof of prioritization is getting laid.

1693
02:13:52,420 --> 02:13:57,420
So if you have these kind of security measures in place,

1694
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:04,140
will immediately kind of present at least in formal markets that you have an explosion at the bottom.

1695
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:11,260
So yeah that's something to take into account and also clearly even with a national context

1696
02:14:11,260 --> 02:14:15,020
you need to look at the functions and that's connecting back to the new party.

1697
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:20,220
Cities have different kind of functions and that will also shape its trajectory.

1698
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:27,260
If you look at city like Detroit or Charlotte Wab, it's not so likely that these places

1699
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:34,460
role now become leading global command and control centers, okay? Because they don't simply

1700
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:42,540
don't have that economic trajectory. So that's something this positionality in global economic

1701
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:50,140
systems has also been taken into account. Including then I think, yeah, the future, how would it look

1702
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:57,260
like. This kind of freemeling here but it's kind of lightly and you see in the

1703
02:14:57,260 --> 02:15:03,820
kind of current developments in cities also a mid-COVID is that it's very likely

1704
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:10,940
that these growing inequalities are only going to increase according to me. You see that

1705
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:19,180
austerity has been sent around in kind of forced. There's a lot of intervention linked to

1706
02:15:19,180 --> 02:15:22,180
We call it, there's again a discuss of a strong state.

1707
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:29,180
But as you saw that, you immediately have a lot of official documents that it had to be temporary.

1708
02:15:29,180 --> 02:15:34,180
And now you see a return to a kind of discourse that there will be again,

1709
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:37,180
but it's got to be made, so it's a coincidence.

1710
02:15:37,180 --> 02:15:42,180
And flounders, we are preparing the ditching from the ditching jump.

1711
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:45,180
So our education is to go digital.

1712
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:50,180
But at the same time, we have to have a budget of 100 million euros.

1713
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:54,180
So, okay, how do you marry those two?

1714
02:15:54,180 --> 02:15:58,180
I mean, for sure, those ways to become more efficient,

1715
02:15:58,180 --> 02:16:01,180
but at the same time, it's not really credible.

1716
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:09,180
So, nothing really has changed, I think, in this mark-to-narrative of austerity.

1717
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:11,180
So, that's kind of continuing.

1718
02:16:11,180 --> 02:16:15,740
And you can say the flexibilization of the labor market.

1719
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:18,940
It's still also progressing.

1720
02:16:18,940 --> 02:16:23,540
Okay. It will be different in different kind of contexts,

1721
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:26,940
but it's not really going away.

1722
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:30,140
Migration, as you know,

1723
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:35,500
and this is linked obviously to wider issues such as

1724
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,740
global change,

1725
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:43,140
will simply be more people that will have to rely on migration to still make a living.

1726
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:50,140
Rish also means in a lot of cities if you don't work on social security, minimum agents, etc.

1727
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:56,220
You won't do anything about the whole discussion about reserve army of labour.

1728
02:16:56,220 --> 02:17:02,020
So these conditions for exploitation will remain in place.

1729
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:06,060
So that's kind of working at a bottom-end, if you will,

1730
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:13,700
At the same time at the top end, and it's kind of returning a little bit to the whole discussion about income distribution to very start.

1731
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:20,700
We see that there's some kind of return of the Gilded Age as the Thomas Piketty calls it.

1732
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:28,700
So a period in the 20th century where, in the 19th century, sorry, where a lot of,

1733
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:35,460
You could say personal trajectories will kind of shape their way where you already come from.

1734
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:39,900
So it's a form of patrimonial capitalism where it matters more,

1735
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:44,700
who your parents are, than what you do in terms of,

1736
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:50,300
I choose this profession or that profession, I work to choose to work hard, etc.

1737
02:17:50,300 --> 02:18:01,700
And that means that an increasing part of the wealth is not based on income,

1738
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:06,300
but it's based on other sources of return on assets.

1739
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:13,000
So you see that a lot of groups, when you talk about the 1% of the 0.1%,

1740
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:16,600
their income is not an iteration of labor,

1741
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:20,600
but holding shares, bonds, etc.

1742
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:30,600
So this kind of explains why people that depend on an income from labor,

1743
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:33,600
if there's no real wage increases,

1744
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:39,600
well, you lose out on people that are basically representing capital that are shareholders,

1745
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:42,600
that kind of runs away.

1746
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:50,280
this kind of research by by picked a looking at to the share of the 0.1 so not the 1% but the 0.1%

1747
02:18:50,280 --> 02:19:01,480
in the United States Britain, Canada and Australia. We're back in the US at the 0.1 owning 7% of

1748
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:12,200
income, right? So 0.1% of all income in the US. So it's just just try to imagine what that means.

1749
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:20,720
So, and it's an every time you see economic growth and if it's not automatically translated

1750
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:26,240
into an increase in wages, which is obviously a whole bargaining process, you see that

1751
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:31,600
the return on capital increases and that it runs away from real income.

1752
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:37,360
And I think that will be the main discussion, I think, and the post-war era, what you

1753
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:43,080
had, for instance, the US is extremely progressive taxation. The higher incomes were

1754
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:50,000
was taxation of 2.70%. I was considered normal. What you see now in multiple

1755
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,920
presidency, for instance, in the US in the US has been relaxed.

1756
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:59,280
So now counter-tenancies, I would say, corporate taxation as a holder

1757
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:04,040
debate about that, or what extent we need to kind of increase that or standardize

1758
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:10,440
that is the kind of multi-level chess game which will be hard to realize but at

1759
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:16,680
least some things are going on there. So I think at the top end I think I mean if

1760
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:21,640
all goes normal there's no social upheaval I think this trend will just

1761
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:27,320
continue and the question is to what extent? To when is this socially feasible to

1762
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:31,160
keep things together or really to really pull apart and political another kind of

1763
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:35,660
I mean you think about cities and then as the final point it means that this

1764
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:40,560
function of cities is becoming transformed as well and maybe this links a

1765
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:44,640
little bit to what that question was just talking about last week is that cities

1766
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:52,520
become basically safety deposit boxes for those people that rely in wealth. You

1767
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:56,680
can think about absentee, baptism, and loneliness, all kinds of neighborhoods

1768
02:20:56,680 --> 02:21:03,080
that are owned, for instance, by people from the Arab Persian Gulf that don't live in London,

1769
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:10,040
but just yeah, they don't even bother to rent out parts of night bits or Chelsea because they

1770
02:21:10,040 --> 02:21:16,120
don't care because their value of these properties just increases so much that it's irrelevant

1771
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:22,440
whether you rent it out. Another example is shell companies in Manhattan and the Time Water Center

1772
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:30,760
average 30 million for apartments. I think 80% of this case is bought by shell companies,

1773
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:35,480
which is basically trusts within the trust within the trust or whatever. So it's somewhere

1774
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:41,160
the Cayman Islands of the new that trusts that buys these properties, but you never really know

1775
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:47,800
who's behind the shell company. So it's a way to for which individuals and corporations

1776
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:52,600
is the way to do the same property.

1777
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:57,480
You maintain the value of those assets to store their wealth

1778
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:59,160
in places.

1779
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:03,120
And yeah, to add on the final point,

1780
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:06,840
it means that the function of cities is being

1781
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:12,920
done support as holders of value, primarily,

1782
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:17,280
and according to SARS-CoS and the debt, I conclude.

1783
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:24,360
And as a real danger that the process of deprovenization is taking place in these leading

1784
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:26,880
world and global cities.

1785
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:30,160
And the case of absence of an terrorism is a good one.

1786
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:32,160
There's absolutely no life.

1787
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:33,160
Nobody is living there.

1788
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:41,040
It's a kind of pure financial asset or it's an empty tower block where nobody lives.

1789
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:46,840
And it seems to be a very big contradiction because when you think about bustling, bustling

1790
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:48,840
world and global cities.

1791
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:52,840
There's a lot of innovation and diversity, etc.

1792
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:54,840
These are empty shells.

1793
02:22:54,840 --> 02:23:01,840
They're at the store, the value and the wealth of very, very, very, very rich people.

1794
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:06,840
And I think it's an issue that we should reflect on.

1795
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:10,840
Okay, thank you.

1796
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:13,840
Thank you.

1797
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,840
I hope it was not too depressing.

1798
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:20,840
Or maybe that it is depressing and that we do something about it.

1799
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:22,840
on it? Um...

1800
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:25,260
(mumbling)

1801
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:27,760
(chuckles)



# 4 Urban segregation: patterns and causes

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
[Music]

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,200
I don't know whether there's, I see some people with a laptop,

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,120
which you mind to check whether the webcast is working.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,360
Could you click on the link of the link of the live stream?

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,880
I think it should be, it should be working I think.

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,880
um...

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,880
[inaudible]

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,880
So, I'm very glad I'm trying to try to do anything.

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:23,880
[inaudible]

10
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,880
And I think that some of you might know me, and many others might not show me.

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:41,060
I am the excurable of these, these class, and the next one, in a trajectory-urban social

12
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,060
geography.

13
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,480
And I consider myself to be as our own social geographer, so that's a good thing I think.

14
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:57,520
Most of my research has dealt with migration, newcomers in the city, segregation, whiteness.

15
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,000
I've done a PhD with case studies and plumbers in South Africa,

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,160
so many years in Cape Town. I've studied how white-milliplast people move through the city.

17
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,840
Now, what's kind of people they get to meet in the city,

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,160
etc. So I've done some work on the geographies of encounter, the geographies of migration.

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:32,000
And this year I have decided to work less at the university and to spend more time with my

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,200
kids and more time on my bike. I like to cycle. And so it means that I have reduced my workload

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,600
at the university. I still have a 50% teaching assignment. I teach social geography in the first

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,920
year, Bachelor of Geography. I teach some classes in urban geography. I also take the students

23
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,440
on a field trip to Estonia. This will be the geographers this year. I've also done that for the

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,600
master in urban study students two years ago, was the last time I think we did it.

25
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,640
And I'm teaching a course on the city and migration that's a title at the University of

26
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,800
to move. So I have quite some teaching assignments, also supervising some master's thesis

27
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:27,640
to PhD thesis. So that's what I'm what I'm doing. I've written here in my presenter,

28
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:37,480
through M.I. and I'm another white male, mid-aged, middle-class man that you get to see here.

29
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,560
I think this issue of positionality is also an important one, especially in the kind

30
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,560
issues that I will discuss when it comes to diversity, when it comes to migration, whether

31
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,400
my experience is in the city. And so I think that's also something important to point at

32
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,400
and something that we could discuss also further in a semester like whether this is something

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,120
important or not to you. But there will be not so much time for discussion today. There will be

34
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,440
time for discussion in the seminars and that will come soon and there will also be time for

35
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,960
discussion on the field trips. I'm going to run through two field trips for the students.

36
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:25,000
This is for the four cities and the master of urban studies students so not for all the

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,880
other ones. But we have one excursion to Antwerp and one excursion to Shaldrwa next week

38
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,360
that I'm going to run.

39
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,400
And so I wanted to share some practicalities.

40
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,520
And I don't like the fact that I'm somehow bound to my laptop,

41
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
but this is for the live stream.

42
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,160
So let's say, I hope that it's working now.

43
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,080
But so first of all, next week, Tuesday,

44
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,760
I think 40 of you have signed up to go to Antwerp.

45
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,400
Is that correct?

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,240
Who will join me to Antwerp?

47
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,920
Yeah.

48
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,080
I will hand out some excursion guides.

49
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,360
I bridge a ton in color by accident.

50
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,040
I don't know how happy the department

51
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,000
will be about that.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,960
(laughs)

53
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,160
If you get these paper copies in full color,

54
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,440
so you can take one if you join me.

55
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,200
Don't take one if you don't join me

56
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,440
because then I will not have enough copies from everyone.

57
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,520
And what is important, and that's something else

58
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,200
that I want to hand out,

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,600
is that I'm living in Antwerp,

60
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,600
and so I will meet you in Antwerp railway station.

61
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,760
Great.

62
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,800
To be in one wallet.

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,840
Who is joining to Antwerp,

64
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,840
and is familiar with this rail pass or go pass?

65
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,680
No one?

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,760
Yeah, some people.

67
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,760
So I would agree to you and I would like you for all the people that joined.

68
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
I'm going to bring it online.

69
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,760
And so it says, this is a French.

70
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,760
You can also fill it in Dutch Corimiglish.

71
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,760
The day, Tuesday, the dates in the Belgian system with the month here,

72
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,760
then the place in America, beef that will be Brussels.

73
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,760
and then and you need lines for everyone.

74
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,640
It's a bit complicated because you have tickets for those under 26 and other

75
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,760
tickets for those over 26. A bit more expensive.

76
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,760
So I'll give them to you.

77
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,760
>> That means that you are responsible for that.

78
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
>> That's good.

79
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,760
>> That means that you are responsible for that.

80
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
>> Yeah.

81
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
>> That's good.

82
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
>> That's good.

83
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
>> Yeah.

84
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
>> It's good.

85
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
>> It's good.

86
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
>> Yeah.

87
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
>> I think it's good.

88
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
>> I think it's good.

89
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
>> Yeah.

90
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
>> I think it's good.

91
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
>> I think it's good.

92
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
>> All right.

93
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:25,880
So it's important that you meet on time, the 22/8 next week Tuesday we are leaving

94
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:33,320
a rather early with a train that will have as a destination on Vericund, Nordr

95
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,560
bookum which is a small station to the north of Antwerp but it's important that you get off at

96
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,880
Antwerp in Central. Yeah so the group will meet 740 you take you make sure that you get on the

97
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:56,840
train 752 and then I and Louise will make sure together with all of you that you have a line for

98
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:04,680
each students, you get on the train and it will be platform 5 I guess if you're late you pay for

99
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,520
your own ticket. So use let's use that as an incentive. I will not reimburse anyone with these

100
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,080
late. You should travel with the group and then you all arrive at the same time according to the

101
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:25,960
schedule at 835 and I will meet you on the platform. Yeah so that's what we do. We will go cycling.

102
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:32,280
I hope that everyone was aware of that. It will, it is November, it will be cold, it will be wet.

103
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:39,560
So make sure that you bring some gloves and some rain gear because it might, it might be cold.

104
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,000
Bring the excursion guides, especially now that it has been printed in full color,

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,760
because we will use that quite a bit. And we are going to discuss basically the topics of the

106
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,920
this class and next class. So we will discuss segregation and social mix in the field in Antwerp.

107
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:05,400
We will get to cycle about 25 kilometers, that's quite a bit, but it has worked out every year.

108
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:14,280
Nicely so I trusted it will be the same. We're a mouth mask on the train. I don't know what the

109
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,040
regulations will say how we need to get around in enter. We are quite a big group. I might

110
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:28,440
split you up a couple of times and bring a lunch or buy one in enter. I will give you an hour

111
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,480
to have a lunch but we will be in quite a fancy part of time so it might be more complicated

112
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:42,360
to find a cheap place there but not impossible. So you will complete these rail bosses and go

113
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,320
bosses and then you will when you arrive in Enterp, you will give these two to me.

114
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,640
Next week, Friday, I will thank you to Charlotte Wop, or some of you who will join me to

115
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:03,720
Charlotte Wop. Okay, so a similar amount of people and we will meet in the Brussels railway

116
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,040
station, Central, so that's important. Ten minutes later, but still quite early, at 10 to

117
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:18,360
eight in order to be on the train at seven past eight. Yeah, again, the same system that say I will be

118
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,040
responsible for the rail passes and the go passes. If you're late, you will need to get in touch with

119
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,520
a fellow student to know where we are. I'm not going to wait for you at the train station in

120
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:35,320
shall the war, but also you need to pay your own ticket. Okay, and we're going to hike. First through

121
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,560
the city but we will also climb some of these at least one ash heap the riddle in French so this

122
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,840
small mountain of like leftover from the coal mining it is quite steep it can be wet so you should

123
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:58,760
also have some good shoes that allow you to to do that bring a pen and paper and I will bring

124
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,600
you a similar kind of excursion guide probably in black and white for the

125
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,480
shadow-gawah excursion and you can again bring a lunch or buy one in

126
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:17,560
shallow one. Do we have any practical questions about these trips? Yeah?

127
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,280
That's a good question. I think in shallow gawah I will end around five, meaning

128
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,720
you can get back to Brussels around six, but I have a habit to give you the possibility

129
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,240
either to get on a train back to Brussels, but I also suggest you to walk back to Shah

130
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:43,200
Leghua train station. But if you want, you can be back in Brussels at six. From Antwerp,

131
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,400
we will end at six the very latest, because that's the moment when I need to give back

132
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,120
the bikes to the biker until agency. And so that means that you should be able to be back

133
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:02,240
in Brussels at seven. Some other practical questions? No. And I'm looking yeah.

134
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:12,480
No you will get a helmet you will get a look. If you're very eager to take your own bike to

135
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,280
enter, you can do it on the train and it's a bit of a hassle but you will get a nice rental

136
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:24,280
you will get a helmet if you want and you will get a look for the bike as well.

137
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:30,280
So I will see you next week. I will see 40 of you.

138
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Next week, Tuesday in Antwerp Central Railway Station.

139
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I'm looking forward to that.

140
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,280
So these are the practicalities about the excursions.

141
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
I'm glad that I was able to share that

142
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,280
and personally rather than just another message in the town of us.

143
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,280
And today you're not in session one.

144
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
You're in session four.

145
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
You had an introductory class.

146
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,280
You had two classes on world city formation and polarization

147
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
in world global cities.

148
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,280
And basically today we will continue with it on the theme of

149
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,280
class three and I will we will discuss segregation.

150
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:18,160
We will discuss patterns of segregation and we will discuss causes of segregation and next week

151
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,240
I will discuss effects or consequences of segregation. So these are two classes that fit

152
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,800
very well together and there is a clear theme for each of them patterns causes of segregation

153
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:40,000
today. Effects consequences of segregation next week. I assume that all of you have read

154
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:47,840
these two texts. Have you maybe we can also have a look? Who has read these two texts?

155
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:55,040
Yeah, you can be proud about it. Who has not been able to read these two texts? You can also be

156
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,160
proud about that. Okay, so I see that more people have not read it, not read them rather than read them.

157
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:10,400
For the discussion seminar, I think it's important that we have like a shared knowledge and these

158
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,680
two texts for this week and the two texts for next week will be the shared knowledge together with

159
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,200
what is being shared in the class. So I hope that all of you will be able to read these two texts

160
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,840
and the two for next week by the time we have the discussion. So

161
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:37,920
and okay today I have basically three topics. I will discuss first these classical models of urban

162
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,760
form in the text by Pat surely, which was a textbook chapter.

163
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,880
There was a reference to Bergus.

164
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,360
I'm going to talk about Hoyt.

165
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,640
I'm going to talk about Harrison Omen.

166
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,840
Some classical models of urban form

167
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,080
that have been generated by Chicago School Scholars

168
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,480
in the beginning of the 20th century.

169
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,600
Then secondly, I'm going to discuss patterns of segregation,

170
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,760
meaning that we will discuss how to measure segregation

171
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,120
and how you can look at segregation

172
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,760
from different angles. And then at the end of the class, I will discuss some

173
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:19,280
courses or segregation. Why is it that people live in different neighborhoods of the city?

174
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,600
Why is it that you can find white people in one part of town and people of Black African origin

175
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:33,920
in another part of town? So this is the topic list for today. And I'm going to start with this

176
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:45,040
classic a land use model by Bergus. So those of you who have read the textbook chapter by Patchoni

177
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:53,840
have been reading about the Bergus. He was writing from Chicago in 1925. I think that's important.

178
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,240
I will do the live stream like this. I think that might also still work. It's everyone able to

179
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
to give you as a back here.

180
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

181
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,320
Okay, so that's going around the world.

182
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,560
So what was Bergus doing here is trying to understand

183
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,840
how cities were looking like?

184
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,320
And what kind of groups of people

185
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,120
that could find in different parts of the system?

186
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,480
And you were stating that basically you had five

187
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
concentric rings,

188
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,160
the heart of the city that was the loop,

189
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,640
loop I will discuss that later it's a term from Chicago basically the central business district.

190
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,440
Around that you have to assume a transition that's how it involved it and around in the

191
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:48,040
queer zone of working, working, math schools. There is a residential zone, a suburban and another

192
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:56,120
residential zone which is called the community. So five rings around the city. And why was it

193
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,880
and that you have these five rings, well,

194
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,040
because different functions in the city

195
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,200
and different groups of people

196
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,880
were able to pay different rents in the city.

197
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,880
So the theory was that in the center of the city,

198
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,920
the center of this district,

199
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,520
you found, for example, the headquarters of an office,

200
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,480
because they were able to pay the higher rents

201
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,880
that you had so close to the city center.

202
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,240
And third in our main property, that was the theory.

203
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:40,240
You would find, for example, suburban boats, not very dense,

204
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,000
because these people were able to spend too many less

205
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,120
of rent for their part of the forest.

206
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,280
And so this bit of rent theory was basically

207
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,160
underlying this novel of concentric links on the city.

208
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Yes?

209
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,480
The term model can be a little bit confusing.

210
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
And because it could give you the impression

211
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,040
that this is an ideal type like this is how we sit for poop.

212
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,760
But Virgus was trying to do, but basically

213
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,920
to simplify reality and to understand our city's

214
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,200
spur, not necessarily how they open it.

215
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,240
How our cities, and we try to simplify it.

216
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,040
and that's how a simplified version of Chicago

217
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,800
of Western cities looks like.

218
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,280
I told you already written in 1925

219
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,840
and that's very important.

220
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Why?

221
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,320
Because we are at a moment in time,

222
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,320
this is the population of Chicago from 1840 to 2014,

223
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,760
We are at a moment in time 1925,

224
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,240
when this population of Chicago has been growing through

225
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,240
an exponential growth for many, many years.

226
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,720
Yeah, and that also explains why

227
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,000
tourists was making a model of the growth of the city.

228
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,760
Yeah, it's not a model of any city.

229
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,520
It's the model of a growing city,

230
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,480
and you tries to understand

231
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,600
how this growth of the city grows.

232
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,360
both in terms of a growing population,

233
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,200
but also a city that is characterized

234
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,440
by an expanding area.

235
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,160
This built-in environment is grown.

236
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,920
And so it's a level of the growth of the city.

237
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,440
And writing from Chicago in 1925,

238
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,000
well, this is a very particular growing city,

239
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,160
this is a city of immigration, but all of immigrants

240
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,160
from all over the world, but from Europe, in particular initially,

241
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,160
arrived in a very nice settle.

242
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,160
And then you see that in 1900, you have less than 2 million people,

243
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,160
and you need to go only 10, 15 years later

244
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
to the five Mother-Mimics people

245
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
have to the population.

246
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,160
So this is a fast growing city,

247
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,160
both in terms of population and in terms of the area that is built up.

248
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,160
That's also expanding. That's also true.

249
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:28,160
It's also a city that is characterized by a Virginia population.

250
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,160
So what you see here is the result of a survey going from house to house,

251
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,320
One thing of people's door and then checking whether there is someone English speaking in white

252
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:48,400
Irish in green German in purple Dutch in dog furbled Russian in red etc

253
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,940
And so you see that this city was characterized by

254
00:20:51,940 --> 00:21:00,240
Energy in this document all these people coming from different countries for origin arriving in Chicago at that time

255
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,940
So it's a particular city that

256
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,880
Burvis is writing from and I'm saying that because I want to argue that

257
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,720
This theory that

258
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:17,300
Burvis made up and which he thought was universal for growing cities was in fact a

259
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,560
Theory that was mostly applicable to Chicago

260
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,640
So here you see a couple of assumptions which are also mentioned

261
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,900
in the text that you read or that you're going to read,

262
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,580
the assumptions and principles that were underlying

263
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,580
this theory of the model of the growing city,

264
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,740
the growth of the city.

265
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,940
So you see that the assumption is that there

266
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,260
is this cultural and social effort

267
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,500
to eat off the population.

268
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,580
You can also think of other cities and countries

269
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,020
which are less marked by this kind of diversity.

270
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,620
The second assumption is that there is a commercial industrial

271
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,580
based to the economy of the city,

272
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,580
which you think of other bases to the economy of the city.

273
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,820
What kind of other bases could you have

274
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,900
rather than commercial best show?

275
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,580
- Right.

276
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,060
In the horizon, if you go to a city,

277
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,460
that is marked by tourism,

278
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,140
and for example, each stream

279
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,780
could be of any important place.

280
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,460
And a while in a commercial industrial city,

281
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,660
it's in the political center of business districts.

282
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,660
The center of the city is dominated by a touristic place.

283
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,820
Well, many of you would get different time.

284
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,060
I have also saw other time.

285
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,580
as a member of the UN at the other side.

286
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,420
See, find it.

287
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:59,860
Everything's based, yeah, when you were getting a heritage.

288
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,260
I could also imagine like cities that draw a lot of

289
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,300
deliveries, a religious basis to the city of

290
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,260
Temple or church would be central places.

291
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,660
So you can take off other kinds of cities.

292
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,340
And then the idea of burgers would be that this model

293
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,400
of the group, personal warfare.

294
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,500
Right, ownership or property, economic competition for space,

295
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
you can imagine other cities in the Soviet Union,

296
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,020
for example, land and economy, different kind of cities.

297
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,900
And for expanding area and population of the city,

298
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:41,340
many cities in Europe are nowadays marked by shrinkage.

299
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:49,780
in eastern Germany, for example, Genova in the thinkability city that has been

300
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:56,220
marked by Shriepitrofennial on top. Detroit, that will sit in both America, but

301
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,740
that's gone through a similar.

302
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:05,020
Fifth assumption, transport is equally easy, easy rapid and cheap in every

303
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,620
direction within the city. It's hard to imagine how that would ever be

304
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,860
possible because you will always have transport infrastructure that will allow you to move from one end of the city

305
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:23,860
which more quickly to another end and to another part of the city. Number five the city center is the main

306
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:30,500
center for employment and therefore more studyable. You'll also think many other kinds of city

307
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,460
you have for example the airport is an important help and you have a leak and

308
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,380
big developments for rockets. So these things are more attractive because of

309
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,100
differences in terrain. I told you I did my PGD on Cape Town you've got the

310
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,260
Atlantic Ocean you've got table mounted. You can imagine that these differences

311
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:56,780
in terrain are very important to understand how this city is formed. You have no

312
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:02,740
concentrations of heavy industry. Yeah, and you have no historic survival of an

313
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:09,620
burial and your spatter in any district. There is no heritage to you have 19th

314
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:16,540
century housing or a medieval harvest city. And so, Virgis himself already

315
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:21,860
acknowledged that it's our techniques to be added, I'm quoting there, that neither

316
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:28,580
Shikago, nor any other city fits perfectly into this ideal scheme.

317
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,460
Complications in Shikago are introduced by the lake front,

318
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,380
but a lake in Shikago.

319
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,420
And so there is a difference in Shikago River,

320
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,220
another difference in the rain.

321
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,620
Railroad lines, which mean that the transport is not equally

322
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,660
seen rather cheap in every direction.

323
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,600
and historical factors in the location of industry,

324
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,820
in which might mean that you have concentrations of heavy industry,

325
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,660
some parts of the city.

326
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,360
Et cetera.

327
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,660
So you see the acknowledgement that,

328
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,900
well, I'm trying to formulate

329
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,620
a universal model of urban growth,

330
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:17,420
but underlying my theory are a lot of assumptions and principles,

331
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,180
which make that basically unwriting,

332
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,180
I'm writing up a model of a specific city.

333
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:30,180
Chicago and basically my model was called for Chicago.

334
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
There's not even both for Chicago itself,

335
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,180
because there are many congregations.

336
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:41,180
I will discuss this further in a bit like.

337
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:48,180
In urban studies we have been going through a moment where we started to realize

338
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,300
many of our theories are provincial. When we write about gentrification and we make

339
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:59,780
theory of gentrification, then if we make a case on Brussels then we write a very Western kind of

340
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:06,820
perspective on gentrification. So it's necessary to deprovinsulize our theories. I find it

341
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:13,060
interesting that already 100 years ago there was this awareness that, well, me, Burguz, I'm writing

342
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,060
from Chicago and this is important to understand.

343
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,060
So how did this model look like?

344
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:25,060
I will run through this central central,

345
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,060
most central,

346
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,060
concentric ring is the loop.

347
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,060
Why the loop?

348
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,060
If you ever winch the ideal,

349
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,060
you focus metro lines that all converge in the city

350
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,060
and where basically this whole metro is making a loop

351
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:55,060
taking back the line from where it's going. So you have these elevators metal track, in a loop, in the shape of a loop. And so that's why the central business is the kind of scope.

352
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:10,060
So this is the place where you have shopping, where you have offices, where you have headquarters, companies where you expect to find theaters and etc.

353
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:18,060
etc. Because these are the functions that are able to pay the highest rent, the highest price

354
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,860
for the central one pitch. Why do they want to be in the central location? Well, these are all

355
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:31,740
functions that need to draw office workers, shoppers, de-entergoers from all corners of the city.

356
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:39,500
And so for them, it is important to be in the central location that is easy to reach from

357
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:50,540
everywhere in this. So they want to be in the room. She got on 1925 pictured the

358
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:59,500
media on IP, busy streets, the first skyscrapers of the world in the city, earlier than New York,

359
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:06,300
and so we have basically the first city where you have this, I'm just saying that like this

360
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,620
the classical central business district

361
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,980
from the North American town city.

362
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,980
So, so soon, one, the central business district.

363
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,300
Around this, you have the zone,

364
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,460
in transition, the zone of transition.

365
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:30,820
Basically what you find there is factories.

366
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,980
Why do these factories want to be located there?

367
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:41,420
They also rely on labor that needs to come in by a trend, by a metro, etc.

368
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:48,820
So they also want to be in a central location that allows them to bring in workers from all corners of this.

369
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:56,780
But they are not able to pay these high prices for length, that these functions on the previous slides were able to work.

370
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:03,860
So we will find a second to bring in which you have these factors.

371
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,860
Not only factories, you also find neighborhoods there.

372
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,840
Who wants to live close to these factories?

373
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
Nobody.

374
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,800
This is very poor, you took this very dirty.

375
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,720
These are very bad living services.

376
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,760
So who ends up here?

377
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,640
The first generation of immigrants

378
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,160
from different countries of origin.

379
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,600
Yeah, and as soon as these people are able to force

380
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,600
move to a better part of town than they will do so.

381
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,600
These names that you find on the pictures, little hell,

382
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
those quite a bit.

383
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
But also the fact that, for example,

384
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
here you have little Sicily,

385
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,600
so this is a part of town where this Sicilian is derived.

386
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,600
That was formerly little Sweden.

387
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:05,200
So you see how one group of newcomers moves out and is followed by a new group of people

388
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,000
from another country of origin.

389
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,400
That was what Berghis was noticing in 1925.

390
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:17,600
And so this is the part of the Chicago, close to the central business district, close

391
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:26,080
to do, in the middle of all these factories, where people who just landed off the boat

392
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,960
from Europe and Iraq. And so you have some secret groups, and these are these of new commerce

393
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:42,720
school Iraq. People who have been able to climb the social ladder, they will move out of these areas.

394
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:54,520
And they are able to afford a better home, further away from these factories, and they are also able to afford the commutge between home and the world.

395
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,520
So there's also a price to be paid for this.

396
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,520
So, verbus is writing there about the zone of independent European France, who's dead.

397
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,520
And in his vocabulary, respectable working class is living there.

398
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:24,520
So I found it interesting that I hear six miles northwest of the loop, more west.

399
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,520
So we are moving in that direction about 10 kilometers out of the loop.

400
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,520
You also had an area of Chicago that the family had quite some Belgians living.

401
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,640
And Berghis was also writing about the Belgians.

402
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,320
Many of them were geniters.

403
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,160
So they also had like a specific profession

404
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,520
that many of them were home forms.

405
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,200
And they also had a colloquine.

406
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,240
So you see here, 1921, whole Belgians are equal.

407
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,200
They built a colloquine for Belgians.

408
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Celebrating Belgian-based and Belgian traditions,

409
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:14,200
We have a St. John Burickman's church, Cynthia and Bechmans in Chicago, and so after the day you can visit the neighborhood that was marked by a Belgian son of the post.

410
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,840
Empathy also has neighborhoods where you had many German or many Russians for many Italians

411
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,760
who had been able to find this social weather and who had been able to out with further

412
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,000
away from these effectiveness.

413
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,840
I have also shown you this map of the survey going door to door.

414
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,440
There was a lot of heterogeneity even in streets that some neighborhoods were also marked

415
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,400
by these ethnic groups.

416
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,560
And then as you go further away from the loop,

417
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,920
you get to more suburban, less dense developments.

418
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,840
Here you see the neighborhood of Mount Prospects.

419
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,480
About 25 miles more west from the loop.

420
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,240
And so we are moving about 40 kilometers out of the loop.

421
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,600
Now 30 to 60 minutes commute to the loop by train.

422
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,040
And so the moment that these trains are being trained lines are being filled,

423
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,960
you see these kinds of suburban developments.

424
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,720
And then you see my prospects 1917.

425
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,760
This is a K-trick of my memory, the 50th.

426
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,880
And this was the ring of the day.

427
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,160
But you also see who is living there,

428
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,160
on the twist, 3D shadowies who have arrived quite early

429
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,120
and were contained like a flying this source of color,

430
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,200
and we'll arrive a little bit on Sweden,

431
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
but then we'll move to the so-and-well,

432
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,000
respectable working and its homes as very as common,

433
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,680
but we'll be able to, as they climb to the social weather,

434
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
we'll also be able to,

435
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,320
to these suburban developments in bringing forward.

436
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,960
- So I have a question about the French private,

437
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,480
and it seems like all of the stuff,

438
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,560
the city of France, but the craftsman,

439
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,320
like it seems like the party is important,

440
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
it seems like the French is too.

441
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
- I'm sorry.

442
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,360
How do you feel that they're rent?

443
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
They're a part of it.

444
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,760
Is it revenue, how do you work?

445
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,800
I think the part they have.

446
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,880
Yeah, but you need to see it rent for like you need to pay $12 per stream.

447
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,240
Yeah, and so closer you get to the city center,

448
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,720
the tensor is developed.

449
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,920
We saw it.

450
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,760
And so for that reason, it's not about like what you can't

451
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,080
afford, but how much you are willing to pay per stream.

452
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,680
And so these developments closer to the center are much more dense.

453
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,760
And so that explains why this bitter and poor

454
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,800
is still going down.

455
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Now, yeah.

456
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:57,920
Virgus, so the concentric zone model.

457
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,760
And a theory that is still being used--

458
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,160
but even today, if you read about newcomers in cities

459
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,400
and neighborhoods of arrival, and people still refer to tourists,

460
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,880
maybe conceptualized.

461
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,160
This arrival of newcomers in Chicago,

462
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,120
and the kind of neighborhoods that they were going through,

463
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,760
as they climbed the social networks.

464
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:29,400
But you also have other models.

465
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,120
I'm still, before the second world war,

466
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:41,760
and points another researcher who studied 142 American cities and who stated in the beginning

467
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,200
of his paper that so far reaching are the changes in our population pattern and social

468
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,640
structure that it can well be asked whether theories of city growth and structure formulated

469
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,680
for the private enterprise economy of the late 90th and 20th centuries is now referring

470
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,420
to veriviously would be well be applicable in a future society that may be

471
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:14,760
of a fundamentally different nature. What happens between 1925 and 1939 in

472
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,160
America? What kind of changes would be so important that you just have an

473
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,400
impact on the model of the world?

474
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,780
Yeah, the depression.

475
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,300
So this is about crisis, a moment of economic crisis.

476
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,300
Yeah?

477
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:39,340
And when you look at, we'll go a couple of slides back.

478
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:48,180
Yeah, when you look at population growth and in Chicago,

479
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,580
then you see that this crisis, 1920 by the 1930s,

480
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:58,180
But this is a clear impact also on the population of shiitaj.

481
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,220
As people are eager to immigrate,

482
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,180
and to a country in crisis, the government

483
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,660
is also more strict on who can come, et cetera.

484
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,300
And so there is a big economic crisis that also

485
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,100
means that there is less migration related to less migration

486
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
to the states.

487
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,500
There are also other phenomena.

488
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,300
of white was writing itself, a new theory of civic grade growth made

489
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:30,500
necessary to fit the effects of a period when cities grow more slowly,

490
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:36,260
and that's what I told you already, but also when automobiles and airplanes

491
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:42,500
removed dependency on fixed rails, the car becomes much more important.

492
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:48,820
You can imagine that a city built for car drivers looks quite different from

493
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,820
city that is built for people to take a tram or a metro or a train.

494
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,820
And he also adds that what is also different is that there's more government control and fixation of high incomes

495
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,820
for the benefit of the poor. This is a graph that sells you something about

496
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,820
taxation of the top income rates in the states. And so you see that this has been going through

497
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,700
going through fights and changes. And as described as when America was hit by

498
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:26,060
prizes that there was an urge to do it, so we have more texts, more income texts,

499
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:32,620
these highest power that means is that government can also intervene more in-house

500
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:39,260
in-game infrastructure, et cetera, et cetera. And so a couple of changes that

501
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:46,140
is it we have been going through and so what is saying well these models made for cities of a

502
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:53,740
particular kind remember these assumptions of burgers to not hold true in the cities that I am

503
00:39:53,740 --> 00:40:02,540
studying in the 1930s this 104 cities because we see a lot of different kinds of processes

504
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,900
So, Hoyt came up with a sector of...

505
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,900
... At a sector of theory, saying that,

506
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,900
"Well, you still have this central business district in the city."

507
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,900
So, around this, you do not have a couple of concentric rings,

508
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
but you have sectors.

509
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,900
And the assumption is that when the city grows

510
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,900
at each of these sectors, a little growing,

511
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:39,460
And so if you have to the, in this case, to the east sector in which the richest people

512
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:44,260
are living, and the assumption is that when these group groups or the population from

513
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,500
the city grows, that this sector will also grow to the east.

514
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:56,780
And so you have a couple of different sectors, I class medium class, both class, which are

515
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:05,660
also organized by the transportation infrastructure. So you would have industry

516
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:13,020
factories concentrated along rivers, allows rain lines and roads. You may at the

517
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:18,380
next day that you would have both glass residential areas just like

518
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:24,060
burgers assumed. The burgers assumed that these factories and the lowest

519
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,060
world-class areas would be located in a concentric ring.

520
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,060
And Oric was saying, well, if you look at cities in the 30s in America,

521
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,060
and the sector model comes closer to reality.

522
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,060
So this is a better way to simplify how cities are looking.

523
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:48,060
So sectors rather than concentric rings,

524
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:52,060
what is also important is that there's much more emphasis on

525
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:59,660
and medium-class, low-class, high-class. While Virgus was often writing from these ethnic groups,

526
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:07,180
Italians, Sicilians, Germans, Russians, Swedish, and people arriving in the city.

527
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,260
And...

528
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:20,860
Okay, a third moment is the one by Harry's and all, and this is a garage for a

529
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:27,820
a picture that comes from their paper. We wrote now on the 19th or 25 and you see that in

530
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:33,900
their paper they make a reference already, just got sent to it. So mobile by burgers. They refer

531
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,980
to the sector theory by Boyd and then they come up with their phone mobile, just got

532
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:47,340
controlled people locally modeled of the city and you see in date that they have

533
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:52,620
this kind of jigsaw puzzle that represents the city for them in which you still

534
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:58,540
find number one essential business district and next to it and next to it

535
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:03,260
this trick would also a live manufacturing which you also see a couple other

536
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:08,620
notes that are important to understand the city for example seven and

537
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:16,940
outline business systems. So this is an important difference between these two models and that one.

538
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:24,220
There's not just one central business list which also has important business districts in other parts

539
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:33,260
of the city. For example in London and even in the history, there is an open state. You have this

540
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:39,980
economic hard of the city, of the city, close to the dollar bridge and you've got a political

541
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:45,260
heart of the city, close to the westerns there, there is a distance between us to, while

542
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:51,340
in this traditional bubble, you would expect them to be concentrated, close to each other

543
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:57,980
in this central business district. They also refer to Chicago, they say there are a couple of

544
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:05,740
industries or universities which are in very different parts of the city than this

545
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:12,140
burgers model, quite more, and expected. So then we refer to area of any industry

546
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:18,940
that I call it, close to the river in the lake. And then also this university of Chicago

547
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:26,780
for the south of the, which is then again like the hook of an area in which you find

548
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,780
of the military people, the university, the pictures, and people working at the university.

549
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,780
And part of the town where you would not expect that to.

550
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,660
And so they also look at his kind of spice in the big

551
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,780
witrant, saying that well, formerly according to Ferguson, this would always come

552
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:52,140
down by the further you get from the city center, the lower

553
00:44:52,140 --> 00:45:00,220
is bitter and occur with me. The lower the price per square meter that people of poor companies

554
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:06,300
or other pensions are willing to fake, but then Aristotle would say, well, you always find this kind

555
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:13,740
of low spice, for example, local shopping centers, not all the shopping is happening in the central

556
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:21,100
business district, so you can find these low-risk shopping centers or a satellite city and around which

557
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,980
you fight again like this, the increasing

558
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,020
and the threat force.

559
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,940
So the third model, head is an omen,

560
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:35,140
where you have multiple, nuclei, more than one center,

561
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,980
basically, and you get this kind of itself

562
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,380
was to simplify perfect force.

563
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,620
In this theory, they upon consider those 10

564
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,020
[INAUDIBLE]

565
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,620
Well, in that case, if that's the table,

566
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,100
they work.

567
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,740
Yeah, every city will have a different kind

568
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:02,180
of form of them in argument that these models are too simplistic.

569
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,780
And not everything is ready, anything from one center

570
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,580
with the practice you will always find, but then one.

571
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:14,340
So that's why reality looks more complex than in these minutes.

572
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,620
OK.

573
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:23,860
And why to go back to Chicago, why to go back to theory

574
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,100
that have been written 100 years ago?

575
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,380
I think it's interesting to make urban geographers

576
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:34,100
of people who are not studies, to make them think about the form

577
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,100
of a system and who is living where they are.

578
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,660
And so on the left, you have cleared a map of Chicago

579
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:49,940
nowadays and each dot basically represents one person to put the ultimate Detroit

580
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:57,300
ultimate report, finds maps for other American cities like that and so you see here that

581
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:04,340
basically the different colors on the back represent different people who self identify

582
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:12,260
with different racist slash ethnicities. So then making you find people self identify

583
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:19,180
and the climate is too wide in the year 20 then in blue we find people self-identify this

584
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:26,500
black in green people who self-identify this Asia and in orange people who self-identify

585
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,020
this Spanish.

586
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:36,260
In the American context, the race, the ethnicity corresponds very much with class.

587
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:54,260
And so if you would have a map with socio-economic classes, then you would also find that most of these neighborhoods, which turn out to be a big number of times, where you have a majority of people, so identified as white, so it would be the better of neighborhoods.

588
00:47:54,260 --> 00:48:02,260
And the neighborhoods, with people who self identified, black, could be underprivileged neighborhoods.

589
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:09,260
So now I question for you which of these models of urban form the concentric

590
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:16,260
remodel by Virgus, the sector level by wood where this multiple nuclei model

591
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:22,260
can you find on the mat.

592
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,260
It will not be a lot, so you can find elements of basically all three models

593
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:36,260
on the map. So when you look at this close, what do you see? Who sees that?

594
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:41,260
>> For now, when you see a question, it might be a question, but it's too sweet to be a find that's

595
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:48,260
right out. >> Mm-hm. You find these kind of sectors.

596
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:57,260
And indeed, I have the Metro Metro Chicago. This will be the central business district.

597
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:02,260
to have like pieces of pie that start from the central business.

598
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,380
So in the scratch of Chicago nowadays,

599
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,300
it's still looking like for it with a predicted

600
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,060
with these different sectors corresponding

601
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,180
with different population groups,

602
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,140
different socio-economic classes,

603
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,860
low-class, high-class, medium-class.

604
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,580
They use the vocabulary by, by point,

605
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,420
so in these, you can still find that there.

606
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:54,660
So, what is represented on the map? In these terms, it's considered to be relevant, but yes, so we still make that like also for some reason. We still find it important to do that. But when you look at the pattern.

607
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,660
So I would feel like more of a over-the-contestive

608
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,660
I would say our own focus is about it.

609
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:08,660
But that's just a bit of a fight.

610
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,660
From the airport, so indeed it's very hard to see

611
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:17,660
concentric sense, the ring one, because there will be very few

612
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,660
residents of the Central Business District.

613
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,660
It's also hard to spot concentric ring two.

614
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,660
It's also hard to spot some trickering three.

615
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,660
But then when you move further away from the city center,

616
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,660
it's a ring number of four and a ring number five,

617
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,660
where a bird is really expected to better off.

618
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,660
Residents who are blind to social better,

619
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,660
because still see that even today,

620
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,660
these are indeed the places where you find almost exclusively

621
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,660
white, dominated paper roots.

622
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,660
And so this is still the case.

623
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:56,660
That's what this ring number 4 and 5 are still there.

624
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,660
Every single woman is multiple, quickly.

625
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:07,660
[inaudible]

626
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:12,660
Yeah, you can define, so for example, to see an example,

627
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:42,560
example. It's like his neck, like running, posture, sound. I hear that. Yeah, let the rest of it. I do. I like it. There are two questions. Okay, so in the future I have a cluster of these, I think, people who sell identified as his colleague in the South. And that's around this, a caliber to river. In the street area.

628
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:52,120
Yeah, you also have a cluster of whites in a sector that is blue, that is dominated by

629
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,960
people who are so identified as black.

630
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,840
And this is this university of Chicago crests.

631
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:08,560
So up to today, you can still see remnants of this horizon, almond bubble.

632
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:14,360
And also the reasons why they wanted to refine or give more detail to this consensus

633
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,280
green model and sector.

634
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,280
Yeah.

635
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:25,280
So I hope that these models make you think about how different cities look like.

636
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,400
And that they also make you aware of well, in different type of cities.

637
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,640
You have different ethnic groups, different socio-economic classes, making up different

638
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,640
parts of the city.

639
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,720
And this can be very different.

640
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,480
And for us also for example,

641
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,680
is a city where poverty is very central.

642
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:49,640
We have the medieval city, but then when you have

643
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,760
the medieval city, you get to a 19th century government

644
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,440
related to industrialization.

645
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,800
This is where you find the poorest neighborhood

646
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,080
across the spectrum of each world,

647
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,120
and it's just a small Los Angeles.

648
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,360
These are poor districts of the city.

649
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,080
And they are very close to the medieval artists.

650
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,760
You have other kinds of cities, for example.

651
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,800
Paris, where you have much more wealth,

652
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,400
close to the city center.

653
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,000
You have much of the poverty and very peripheral.

654
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,200
So it is interesting to compare differences

655
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,560
and to understand various poverty,

656
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:32,560
located where do different racial ethnic groups live in the city.

657
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:43,960
And so when you do that, you will also be able to make a simplified model of the city that you are familiar with,

658
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,960
the city that you want to study.

659
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,960
And you will also come to an understanding that this work is on point and there is an open bubbles are very simplistic.

660
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:59,480
And that in different countries, in different cities, you would have very different models.

661
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,880
And I have a couple of examples.

662
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,520
This is one from Kiausli that is also used in the textbook.

663
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,680
But you have in the British context, these council estates.

664
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,680
Yeah, built on peripheral land.

665
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,260
And so in a concentric ring where Ellis,

666
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,380
and

667
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,360
Burgess would expect private suburban housing,

668
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,000
you also have these council estates, just

669
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,320
like these volunteers in the French context.

670
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,600
very much of the poverty is horrifically,

671
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,440
while that contradicts a burden.

672
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,520
The Chinese city,

673
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,800
was ever a bird of the Cheng Cheng

674
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,600
truth, my pronunciation will become a bird.

675
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,200
Cheng Cheng,

676
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:56,400
nobody said this in China, also fast-growing.

677
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,640
In China, you basically have a noodle or an urban citizen.

678
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,360
The Google system, probably the third.

679
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:15,800
And you have villages, which were taken up by farmers,

680
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,960
which are noodle pieces of land.

681
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,520
And you have people with this noodle citizenship,

682
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,800
with the noodle living.

683
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,640
When people from the countryside migrate to the city,

684
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,640
they are able to take up residence in these old villages.

685
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,520
And because then, who took this citizenship

686
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,640
you might make, say it like that,

687
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,520
allows them to stay in this area.

688
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,080
So you have a many Chinese cities,

689
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,360
parts of the city that I look like that,

690
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,440
where you have a very formal part immediately next

691
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,640
to a part of the city that looks much more informal,

692
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:57,800
much more dense. And that's because when the city grows over this countryside,

693
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:04,720
that these rural villages from the past become these religious in the

694
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,020
city where they have a lot of newcomers arrived. And so in these Chinese

695
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:14,320
cities, the model of the Chinese city, we've looked very differently from

696
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:22,320
because you have these areas that used to be villages or centres of villages,

697
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:29,320
where you have people with emigrating from countryside, from other parts of China,

698
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,320
who arrived there.

699
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:37,320
So this change from true, I think it means something like village in the city.

700
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,320
And these are areas that I was just talking.

701
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:50,320
The African city, the play of a whole pro-life in 62, very different again.

702
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,320
Because transport is much more complicated, is African cities.

703
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:00,320
So, bridge people refer to the close to the cities and the poorest of them who are

704
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,320
right from the countryside will arrive at the very ends of the city,

705
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,320
and very peripheral locations where it takes you two or three hours to get to the south.

706
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:14,440
So this city is looking different again.

707
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:20,720
My Davis, Los Angeles, you might have heard of the Chicago School, Burbs, for example,

708
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:26,440
that you might also have heard of Los Angeles, who of course modern photographers riding

709
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,440
across Los Angeles.

710
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:34,720
And my Davis, and who wrote an interesting book in 1992 and tried to make the 1998

711
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:41,720
for me, a model of how people's angels look like in the night.

712
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:47,720
And you might have heard of Skit Row, this part of the city,

713
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,720
there's thousands of homeless people living on the street,

714
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,720
just next to the central business district of Los Angeles.

715
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:00,720
So this is the song of transition, and this is where the poorest of the poor live,

716
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,720
He needed the next to the central business.

717
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,400
But you also had a pet bike,

718
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,400
these gated developments at the periphery of the city,

719
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,760
where he had the richest of the rich living in these gated suburbs.

720
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,680
I'm sorry, you could also see that, basically, these borders

721
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,080
between the different drinks were being walled, fortified,

722
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,840
that is anchorage in the city.

723
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:34,840
So you're trying to make a mobile of Los Angeles in the 1990s.

724
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:44,840
Mark Vage's desperate poverty, some parts of the city, and then also this fell in other parts of the city.

725
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,840
And in the end there's still a lot of burgers in the small.

726
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:56,840
There's still the central business district, there's still the Corro, and there's still this forest of the poor living community next time.

727
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:01,640
in the zone of transition between mixed the factories and this little hell

728
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:07,880
or little system, but people living with the streets. And I'm not more able

729
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,920
out of this at the center of the rich earth, it's never good to get. It's also

730
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,560
very much good. So trying to make a follow up, Los Angeles, in that

731
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,560
that I did.

732
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,560
I'm also a little touchy.

733
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,560
Sorry.

734
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,360
Thank you.

735
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,480
Yeah, I-- one hour ago, I took out

736
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,980
the slides with a couple of four

737
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:34,160
telling-- again, trying to understand, for the post

738
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:39,360
socialist city and wood light, but then also using

739
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,720
ballot as an example, but also trying to understand

740
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,280
what kind of problems do we see in these socialist cities

741
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,200
and then in these post-social cities.

742
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,760
and how can we try to generalize the simplify.

743
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,800
And so that attempts to make a low is an attempt

744
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,080
to simplify reality and to try and understand

745
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,960
what this particular about cities.

746
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,600
And what makes Los Angeles different from Chicago

747
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,440
in 1925.

748
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,200
So you also have indeed puzzles for European cities.

749
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,360
This was a British city.

750
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,000
curiously in this council estates that you could also make a model for a

751
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,680
stuck hole and try to think like what the specific of a stuck hole

752
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:28,360
I understood the problem from better to all the cities and then we're like general models

753
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:35,400
by I think it's not because I'm so in there by the general one

754
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,400
I think not that I know because this this

755
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,600
This event has been like a special fashion of American events.

756
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:48,720
And indeed, you could think how these assumptions that burgers some that are that I have

757
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,280
some not only slide in it, finally fixed.

758
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,120
But there's some of them are, are, uh, actively European.

759
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:02,920
Like for example, this idea that there can be an early on energy, so your peak city

760
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,320
is then to have a long history.

761
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,540
So for that reason there are always parts of the city,

762
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,520
and to always something to have a growing city,

763
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:17,320
in a sense area, so you always have 30 land users

764
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,120
and you have a history of the city.

765
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:26,020
There's also much more state intervention in Europe.

766
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,820
So we could think like how European city

767
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:32,420
would be different from these assumptions or burgers.

768
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:36,820
I want that with me that for the mother-world.

769
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,620
I have found that, but it could be an interesting--

770
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,700
it could be an interesting exercise.

771
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,100
Good thing how it is, what makes--

772
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,140
what is particularly European out of the city?

773
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,060
And is this something like it?

774
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,860
I just told you that the rest of them

775
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,700
took different from Paris.

776
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,860
It was just two hours, so I'm not allowed by three.

777
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:03,300
So it might also be possible.

778
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,740
So I think it's like our idea of what we did

779
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:09,020
to know when we studied college for dinner

780
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,900
with joint comedy, why is there--

781
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,860
because I think alumni are going to be

782
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,020
in this three days, only last time

783
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:19,340
in the built-in scenario.

784
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,900
Since then, there's three for all.

785
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,100
Like, what will happen?

786
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,500
I know there's so much projects through your sewing states.

787
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,660
And I assume that, for example, when

788
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:31,040
the nervous was making up the model in front of the body.

789
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,440
That's almost less strict and less regulated.

790
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,840
And it is non-dicks.

791
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,960
And when you're also in you have a city that is growing that fast,

792
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:46,360
that is having 1 million extra inhabitants in the very short period of time.

793
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,520
And then the city grows fairly organically.

794
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:55,200
And then it's also very hard as a planet to be put with the base, but the city is growing it.

795
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,720
but I must have been in the eye.

When exactly it must become a state.

798
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:12,440

800
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,440
- Uh-huh, okay, and can you read it?

Or not to know?

802
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,880

how does the ownership of people of these states

885
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:24,160
So I will be asking if I will show you, let's go through it.

886
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:31,320
It seems there's urban differentiation, like that bridge, and four of them are the

887
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,320
neighborhoods.

888
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:38,320
There are people from different ethnicities, different generations of view colors that

889
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,800
they live in different neighborhoods.

890
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,200
somehow it seems to be some characteristic of most different whole cities.

891
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,340
I've been showing you a levels grow.

892
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:57,080
Africa, Los Angeles, Chicago, United Kingdom, and I've been talking about this model of

893
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,880
socialist or socialist.

894
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:04,960
It seems that in each of these levels there is this idea of different groups of society

895
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,220
and whether you define them in social economic classes

896
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:11,720
or different ethnicities or some of identity

897
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:15,080
by race, but these different groups

898
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,280
take a different part of the city.

899
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:22,220
And it also seems that different local features

900
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:25,040
impact of a permanent forum.

901
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,000
For example, this link in G.D.

902
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,800
I hope you could see that there are references

903
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,880
to the wins direction in some of these models,

904
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,960
migration, patterns, etc.

905
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,160
And obviously also local policies and transport system.

906
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,200
Stay in the region in housing,

907
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,520
desire B, for example,

908
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,000
the Scouts of the States for the body use

909
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,120
and the pre-career city.

910
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,120
And restrictions of mobility in the Chinese context

911
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:59,120
of the system determining where to live

912
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,000
or where you could set your kids to school.

913
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,760
strategies to counter the hypothesis.

914
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,840
So that also means that most of these models of urban form,

915
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,120
even if they say this is the bottle, the American city.

916
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,840
But they somehow wear bird marks that they are situated

917
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,280
in a specific space in a specific time.

918
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:24,000
The model of Chicago for 1920s was a model of the growing city.

919
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,800
And with this already 10 years later,

920
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,120
when this American economy has been hit by crisis,

921
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,720
is modeled with not all true anymore

922
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:36,320
because the city was not growing at the fast pace.

923
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,920
And so it's always about situating these models

924
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,320
in time and space.

925
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,880
And so that also makes it necessary to provincial us

926
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,280
at the theories about it.

927
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,280
Oh, great.

928
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,520
And I like to show you some exact questions

929
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:58,160
to make you think like how will I ever make you--

930
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,520
like what kind of questions could you

931
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,520
you straight from this and this is a question that I've asked for in 2016.

932
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,520
You have the model on the side African, both of our state city,

933
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,520
by a particular author and then all our familiar,

934

all of you are with this studio fund.

Right.

939
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:26,520
So you have some references to this legend.

940
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,880
And then I asked you which elements of variousoids and errors of the

941
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,760
Do you recognize in this model?

942
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,760
What about that?

943
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,760
Sit.

944
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,640
That's really a way to check whether you understood what these models are

945
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,640
about.

946
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,280
You're able to apply that to another one.

947
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,280

948
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,680
>> I was touched.

949
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,680
>> What are we doing?

950
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,080
>> Don't anyone have to take time?

951
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,080
>> Yes.

952
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:59,080
the following model.

953
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,080
They have, I found it in a book that I don't remember,

954
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,080
which is perfect.

955
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,080
They should ever look and know I don't.

956
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,080
I can look at it.

957
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,080
I don't know if they'll do the thought.

958
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,080
I can tell you also the thoughts.

959
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:22,080
So first, our these classical models of perfect form,

960
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,560
but also some more reasons

961
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,680
and place with several models.

962
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,920
But I'm going to discuss now with patterns of segregation.

963
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:40,400
How can we look at segregation in cities?

964
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:45,400
And I will use the definition by two American authors

965
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,320
again, Messi and Beno Duchs-Smesi,

966
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,320
and Nancy Netton to America's sociologist,

967
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,240
who wrote a book called American Apartments.

968
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:59,880
So you see this reference to the silent written signals.

969
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,920
But in the thinking on segregation,

970
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,680
this book has been quite important.

971
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:08,000
And so you see here, what is the definition?

972
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,600
First of all, they focus on the residential segregation.

973
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,840
I could also discuss segregation in leisure spaces.

974
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,760
how many people who play sports or the places

975
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,920
where people spend their leisure time,

976
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,080
how we are desegregate, or I could look at work segregation

977
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,280
to people of different socioeconomic losses

978
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,240
meet each other on work, but most of the work

979
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:37,480
on segregation focuses on residential segregation.

980
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,720
What is residential segregation?

981
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,760
It's a degree to which two or four groups

982
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:49,320
of every unit, find it, this separately from each other in different parts of the urban

983
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:55,800
confiring. And that's the decision. Now what you see in these models that I'm going to show you

984
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:06,440
in the previous hours is that in most cities, different groups that you find them in a social

985
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:14,880
economic rate for this ethnicity, race, self-identifying,

986
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,120
that indeed in all of the cities,

987
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,880
different groups to live in different parts of the city.

988
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,080
That's all within each of these cities,

989
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,080
where this model is.

990
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:25,920
Eight.

991
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,320
It would make sense to look at residential segregation.

992
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,800
As a more, is the messy and dense one

993
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,120
to make this a little bit more complex?

994
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,120
And they say most of the research on segregation

995
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,920
has been too senseless because it looked at segregation

996
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,320
in one particular way.

997
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,400
And so what I'm going to do with you now

998
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:51,520
is to look at, for this, just five dimensions of segregation.

999
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,680
For messy and then, these are called evenness, exposure,

1000
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:59,720
concentration, centralization, and plustery.

1001
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,360
And also the research on segregation

1002
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,760
is discussing evenness.

1003
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,800
So I'm also to look at it.

1004
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,000
What is evenness?

1005
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,800
Evenness refers-- and I'm just reading what you see on slide now--

1006
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,760
refers to the differential distribution

1007
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:24,320
of two social groups among aerial units in a city.

1008
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,160
So a minority group is said to be segregated

1009
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:33,000
if it is unevenly distributed over aerial units.

1010
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Evenness is not measured in any absolute sense,

1011
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,600
but it's scaled relative to some other group.

1012
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:44,600
So we are able to save in this city.

1013
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,840
This is the example that you see there.

1014
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,920
Lights are segregated from blacks.

1015
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:55,840
Or the low socioeconomic losses, if you may call it,

1016
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,000
same like that, are segregated from a high socioeconomic

1017
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:08,000
bridge is segregated from. So you always need these two groups. So you see here that you

1018
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:19,000
can have index, here is this here, and index of this similarity can be calculated. And

1019
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:26,600
I will give you two examples. Some years this goes out of the realm and sometimes this

1020
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:33,880
goes wrong. Imagine that you have a city that is made up of four districts. And in each

1021
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:50,840
of these, you have 75 whites and 25 whites. What would be the index of this similarity

1022
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:59,360
When I use the measure layer, we need to take half of the sum,

1023
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,960
that is what this great sigma is being.

1024
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,680
And now we need to, for each of these neighborhoods,

1025
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,800
we need to say what is the length of relation in an area.

1026
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:16,160
If I just write total length of relation, 25 to 5, 100,

1027
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:24,280
minus 75 the white population in area 1 divided by the

1028
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,600
social white population.

1029
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:31,800
What do we have here for one neighborhood?

1030
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,720
Zero.

1031
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,840
Yeah?

1032
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,920
And it would calculate the sum for this measure for each of

1033
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,520
these neighborhoods so that there will be zero,

1034
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:47,320
a 0, 0, 0, 1/2, 0, 0.

1035
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:54,320
The index of this similarity would be 0, or 0%.

1036
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:59,720
This corresponds with the fact that you need to move 0%

1037
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,520
of the population in order to get an even distribution

1038
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,520
of white and black across the city.

1039
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,280
Because you have an even distribution.

1040
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,520
In each of these four neighborhoods,

1041
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:15,520
You have as many whites as you have in other parts of the city.

1042
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:21,680
And you can also look at another example,

1043
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:26,680
where you would have 100 legs living in one neighborhood,

1044
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:33,040
100 whites in another, 100 whites in another,

1045
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,480
and another 100 whites in another neighborhood.

1046
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:39,200
And if you would make the calculation now,

1047
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,720
and you will get to one, not going to do the computer,

1048
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:46,160
but for those who are able to do this,

1049
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,440
this means the absolute number of this.

1050
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,640
So if you get to a negative number here,

1051
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,560
then it comes closer to the end.

1052
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,400
When you calculate that, it will be,

1053
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,000
then the number will be one.

1054
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,600
Yes.

1055
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,240
And because you will, again,

1056
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,760
so do that with you.

1057
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,840
This is a sum of 100, the number of price

1058
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,840
in the first neighborhood minus 100, the total number of x,

1059
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,160
minus the number of y's in the neighborhood zero,

1060
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,480
and 500, 100, 300.

1061
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:22,000
And for each number, each of these neighborhoods,

1062
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,280
you will get to the number one,

1063
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:30,080
and here you will get one, third, one, third, one, third,

1064
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,200
total two, half of two, one.

1065
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:37,040
Meaning you need to move 100% of the population

1066
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:42,960
order to get an even distribution of these population groups across the city. Either you move

1067
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:52,960
33 flecks from this neighborhood to this neighborhood. And then you can get if you move 33

1068
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:58,560
to each of these, then you get an even distribution of flecks across the city. Or you move all

1069
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:03,280
the white people to that black neighborhood. And then you would also get to the reason this

1070
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,680
some people across the city, according to this neighborhood.

1071
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:11,700
And so there's an index of this singularity,

1072
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:15,320
range is from zero, even this distribution

1073
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,760
to one fairly uneven distribution.

1074
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,240
And basically, in corresponds with a percentage

1075
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,840
of people that you would be moved in order

1076
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:28,240
to get an even distribution of people across different neighborhoods.

1077
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,400
And so this may be complicated,

1078
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,320
But you can just look at the practice.

1079
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,720
So how does this look like?

1080
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,080
You would get to a number.

1081
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,600
This is this percentage.

1082
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:45,560
And what you see here, for example, is that--

1083
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:49,840
so 0 was an even distribution.

1084
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,080
But this example, Y_hunder, very uneven.

1085
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,160
And so the more you look at the prides on this slide,

1086
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,760
more uneven disease are.

1087
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,600
So what is particular is that you see,

1088
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,800
as first of all, American cities tend to be much more

1089
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,360
unpleasable than European ones.

1090
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:13,680
Yeah, so segregation, when you look at the dimension,

1091
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:18,440
evenness, then you find out that in American cities,

1092
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:22,440
the poor, for example, are living much more

1093
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,080
in particular parts of the city.

1094
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:30,040
in the European context, they are a bit more spread across different parts of the city.

1095
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:40,440
And so you see here for different cities and for different population groups, you see how this has been

1096
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:46,440
done. And again, you always need to compare it with another population group. So what is done is

1097
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:50,840
the poor of Edward compared with then the ones who are not considered to be.

1098
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:59,560
And so it's also interesting for those who joined into M-Turk to see that according to these

1099
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:10,680
statistics, poverty in M-Turk in 2005 was also much more unevenly strengthened across the city.

1100
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:17,320
So you had particular neighborhoods where you had that were marked by poverty much more than in

1101
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:26,120
other European schools. This also is scale-ish Belgium and in a very small statistical sectors

1102
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:33,640
that's a part of the explanation. Scale is important, but these sectors grow. They will mask

1103
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:38,920
some of the concentrations of poverty of health that you get in this at least 60 to the

1104
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:54,680
or defined. So this measure of evenness, yeah? So more numbers, again you see that 90,

1105
01:25:54,680 --> 01:26:01,320
and so you get close to 1, Birmingham Bangladesh, I read there, "All time Bangladesh,

1106
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:08,760
called the Bangladesh. So apparently this Bangladesh sheet in UK cities are living very much in

1107
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:15,960
particular neighborhoods of the city. And in these neighborhoods you would find almost exclusively

1108
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:22,280
by much and that explains why you would need to move almost all these Bangladeshic or other

1109
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:28,280
neighborhoods if you would like to get to an even distribution of Bangladeshic in UK cities.

1110
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:35,680
And so you see how this measure is being used in order to say something about residential

1111
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:41,360
segregation in these different cities.

1112
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:50,320
Poverty in Copenhagen, the first quintile will be like the first 20% of the people according

1113
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:58,720
to the income distribution is much less segregated and it spreads much more evenly across

1114
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:05,720
the sick and is in all the other cities that are missing there. So do you understand what

1115
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:14,500
is measure of evenness and evenness means? Yeah? Okay. I get now to these four other

1116
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:19,000
dimensions. So what Messian and Desmond are arguing is that we have been looking at

1117
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,400
segregation, goes through this lens of evenness. There are also four other dimensions,

1118
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:28,160
which are worthwhile, I will leave it.

1119
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,160
That a question.

1120
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,480
- Oh, I would sort of make for an honest example,

1121
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,120
with the one hundred black residents in one end,

1122
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,200
and then the two-second, right, I didn't say,

1123
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:42,040
what does it, what does it need for if you want there,

1124
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:45,240
for the, for white residents in one second,

1125
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,480
and black residents?

1126
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:51,280
Or did I need to put that on? - Well, I'm just,

1127
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,840
I am just for each of these neighborhoods.

1128
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,880
I am calculating, I didn't want to grow too much into this.

1129
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,280
I am calculating this.

1130
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:06,360
And I start from the black neighbor roots.

1131
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:09,580
Their measure for the number will be 100 divided

1132
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:13,220
by 100 to the total number by minus the neighbor

1133
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:16,160
within our zero whites divided by total number

1134
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,800
of whites to be 100.

1135
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,520
That will be one.

1136
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,680
For the white neighbor roots,

1137
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:25,440
and I have three of them. The measure will be there are zero

1138
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:30,240
of legs and I have minus 100, the number of whites in that

1139
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:34,400
neighborhood divided by the total number of whites 300.

1140
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,880
Yeah? So I get here to 1 divided by 3, 1.

1141
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:46,880
And so I get 1 plus 1/3, 1/2 plus 1/3 plus 1/3, 2

1142
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,240
divided by 2, 2.

1143
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,600
But it doesn't say anything about these neighborhoods.

1144
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,800
I'm calculating something at the scale of the city.

1145
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:01,200
And for that, I need to calculate this measure for these four neighborhoods.

1146
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,200
>> Okay, you can add on this.

1147
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:09,200
>> And then I think I realized I know how to do it.

1148
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:15,200
>> And then I need to make the sum of this number in each of these.

1149
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:24,940
So that will be sum of 1 plus 1/3 of 2.

1150
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:30,000
And I need to be vided.

1151
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,640
But that's 1.

1152
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:37,880
But the index of the similarities is 1 in this case.

1153
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:44,640
100% meaning that either 100% of x or 100% of y's

1154
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:54,400
need to move in order to get to an even distribution of both wide sunwax across the seat.

1155
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,400
Okay.

1156
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,320
Four other, yeah?

1157
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:22,180
[inaudible]

1158
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:29,440
Yeah, that's the percentage. So then this would be 100, and this would be zero. And if the index of this

1159
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:34,440
the same level would be 0.5, then you would have 50%.

1160
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,760
And that would be 50.

1161
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:42,080
And so you move close to one, and you are close to zero.

1162
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:46,040
But this is a measure that you would often find in the loop,

1163
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,680
in the loop.

1164
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:52,320
And it would also be often checked like our segregation

1165
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,760
changing across time.

1166
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,000
And it would be the index of the similarity

1167
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:07,520
first hand work has moved from 0.40 to 0.6 in an equal dot order concentrated over time.

1168
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,000
Or more say you need it. Sorry, I'm not using it because more say good.

1169
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:22,560
So I got less evenly distributed across time. Okay, for other dimensions I'm going to move

1170
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,880
to them rather quickly.

1171
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:35,520
There's a potential exposure, which first is the degree of potential context or the possibility

1172
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,600
of interaction.

1173
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:44,240
In this case, in each of the neighborhoods, there is a similar degree of exposure.

1174
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:49,560
The other is when these people limit their lives to the neighborhoods, there will be no

1175
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:59,000
approaches. So this degree is fairly close to evenness but not completely because for exposure

1176
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:07,320
and the number will also be depending upon the total size of these communities. If the total

1177
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:13,720
black population in the city is very low then the chances that you will get to meet a black

1178
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,520
a person are lower already.

1179
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,920
And so the size of the group is important if you would

1180
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:24,000
make a measure for exposure.

1181
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,720
Concentration, dimension number three

1182
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,920
refers to the relative amount of physical space

1183
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,920
over five by a minority group in the urban environment.

1184
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,320
So again, it depends on the size of this one.

1185
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,360
3F here in Haton.

1186
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,280
And we have been these different colors

1187
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,520
again, these different ethnic or racial groups,

1188
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:50,080
or people self-identifying with a particular group.

1189
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:54,520
And so you see that in shades of purple,

1190
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,760
you have the Asian population.

1191
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,280
And so you have China,

1192
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:04,480
and that's where most of these Asians are concentrated.

1193
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,920
They take up a very small amount of space.

1194
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,760
This is a dense neighborhood.

1195
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:16,560
most agents living in Manhattan or living in that particular part of Manhattan.

1196
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:24,240
So concentration, the relative amount of physical space occupied by a minority group.

1197
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:28,360
Number four, center of the city.

1198
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:33,760
It relates to the creed to which a group is spatially located near the center of an

1199
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:40,960
I don't know what the center of New York would be, but if you say it's Wall Street, then these

1200
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,680
Asians are living very centralized.

1201
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:52,000
And while like Africans in the case of New York are not living central anymore.

1202
01:33:52,000 --> 01:34:01,120
The same goes for this example of poverty. In Brussels, poverty is very much centralized.

1203
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,720
these neighborhoods which are marked by COBRT are close to the city center.

1204
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:15,760
In the Parisian days, 40 is very much decentralized. That's much more an issue of these peripheral

1205
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:26,800
volunteers. And in the last dimension is clustering. The degree to which these aerial units

1206
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:34,560
inhabited by minority members and join one another or not. I don't know how familiar you are

1207
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:41,200
with New York, but I remember walking out of the metro station in Flushing, close to Flushing

1208
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:47,520
Meadows where you have the tennis tournament and that was another neighborhood and that was

1209
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,680
was very much marked by a presence of Chinese people.

1210
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:56,680
Yeah, the Soviet have clusters of,

1211
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:02,120
at least two clusters of agents, one in this China attack,

1212
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:05,560
an attack, and another one somewhere here in Russia.

1213
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:11,800
Yeah, and so is the presence of agents,

1214
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:15,840
is a cluster, no, because there are two neighborhoods

1215
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,760
which are quite far away from each other.

1216
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:24,680
Even this exposure,

1217
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:30,240
for the centralization, concentration, cluster.

1218
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:34,280
And so I could also ask you in the exam

1219
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:40,040
to discuss the three most relevant dimension

1220
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,440
of messy and messy,

1221
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,200
or the ones that you still remember.

1222
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:51,520
to these five to discuss social economic segregation process.

1223
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,760
Is over the Western or not?

1224
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,120
Is it centralized or not?

1225
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,120
Is it concentrated or not?

1226
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,760
Is that even the same?

1227
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:08,480
And the data might allow you to say something about it or not.

1228
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:13,720
I already told you when I pointed at these high numbers

1229
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:18,720
of unevenness in entered, that scale is fairly important.

1230
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:24,360
So now here this is a pattern of rich and poor

1231
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:29,440
and you will only detect it as segregation

1232
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:33,160
when you are able to study it at the scale of these

1233
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,960
specific neighborhoods.

1234
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,880
And if your statistical units are this big,

1235
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,240
then it would be, then this would be of any events

1236
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:51,880
you're able to study it at this scale, then this is a very uneven. And so the more refined

1237
01:36:51,880 --> 01:37:00,120
these statistics allow you to grow the higher one with assume these levels of segregation or even

1238
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:09,480
this unevenness will be. So scale and the scale through which you look is something very important

1239
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:15,480
this one. I saw a hand somewhere at the bank and I'm only with the discretion for the relevant death.

1240
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:40,480
[ Inaudible ]

1241
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:45,780
Well, I could imagine, like, some already have a CBD.

1242
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:49,820
And we have four neighborhoods around the CBD,

1243
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,820
part by poverty.

1244
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:55,860
And you would say that poverty is centralized,

1245
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:58,060
but it's not clustered.

1246
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:00,980
And it is also-- is it concentrated on it?

1247
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:06,480
The role of this amount of space and a less

1248
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:13,480
They are related to each other, but there is still something visiting about the digital

1249
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:17,480
associations of poverty, which are very decentralized.

1250
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:24,480
They still put the poor paper-pated space, but this is far away from the city centre.

1251
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:30,480
And then the question could still be whether this poverty is clustered with the you have in the east of the city

1252
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:38,480
or this is roots which are adjacant to each other and is over deep, concentrated.

1253
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:48,480
Or rather this poverty is also decentralized, but also not clustered and not translated.

1254
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:57,480
So you could imagine you could imagine you need to start playing poverty decentralized.

1255
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:02,480
You also expected to be some of the close to the majority.

1256
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:05,480
They are not.

1257
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,480
They are not.

1258
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:11,480
Well, for groups of people, in a sense of data,

1259
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:16,480
they should not understand that today or what,

1260
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:19,480
and I should not present something.

1261
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:24,480
Some are in the center of the arms of the thing.

1262
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:33,360
And you would say, "On routine is centralized in the people, our centralized in Brussels,

1263
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:53,760
rich people are not, because they want to be able to do it. And they can't do it. And they can't do it. And they can't do it. No. No. Okay. These are what's known. And this can create a safe, safe, easy, easy. This is for John's family. Take care of that.

1264
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,760
[INAUDIBLE]

1265
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,560
Well, then it will still be relevant to say that.

1266
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,360
It's not a danger.

1267
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:08,520
OK, so five dimensions of segregation,

1268
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:12,960
which also allow you to speak with a little bit more detail

1269
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,760
about the social differentiation that you find.

1270
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:19,880
So some only about evenness, people living

1271
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,200
in different neighborhoods of the system.

1272
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:25,280
You can also discuss concentration plus three central

1273
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,880
activation exposure.

1274
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,840
There's another question.

1275
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,840
Yeah.

1276
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:33,640
I'm just wondering what the concentration,

1277
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,680
does it matter like the portion,

1278
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,520
like the size of the population?

1279
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:42,160
Like I demanded a city that they're just not very nice.

1280
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:44,480
Very few people are bored of their,

1281
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,960
and then you should have a couple of neighbors

1282
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,280
that are in the first book,

1283
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,320
and that would be all concentrated,

1284
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:53,720
and how we can help the management experience.

1285
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,360
How are many people?

1286
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,560
Yeah, I must admit that I don't know exactly how this

1287
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:01,880
would be measured and how it would operate

1288
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,840
in a certain measure.

1289
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:09,280
But here, it will be about the size of the group,

1290
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,960
how many Chinese do they have?

1291
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:14,400
It will be about the densities that you are talking about.

1292
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:18,360
Tower, it will also be a dangerous square meters

1293
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:22,280
but it implements neighborhoods.

1294
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:25,700
But I don't know how you're with exactly operationalized

1295
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:29,600
that's in this kind of way.

1296
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,680
But for me, the important thing is

1297
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,500
that you understand that there are different front

1298
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:36,960
pages that you can understand this spatial

1299
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,480
differentiation between racial or between like the bias

1300
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:46,760
or between male and female or between normal sexual sexual.

1301
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:49,360
You can look at it in many different ways,

1302
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,360
but that you will be able to study it through this final language.

1303
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:58,320
For me, that's important.

1304
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,300
And I will ask you how to measure

1305
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:03,960
that's around to operationalize it.

1306
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:09,320
But I hope that you understand that it can be meaningful to do it.

1307
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:14,760
And that is, for example, a figure from your statistical

1308
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:32,760
for culture, for example, you have different kinds of cities, topological and German cities. And it matters whether the rich, for example, still meet a different indigenous cities where rich, do not need to come to meet, do not need to be to.

1309
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:39,160
For example, in the Brussels case, these poor neighborhoods are so close to it.

1310
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:45,880
Okay, just do these neighborhoods where each people work, for example.

1311
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:51,080
You would get all conflicts around the front place, but in other kinds of cities,

1312
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:53,640
that would necessarily beat a case.

1313
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:59,160
So for that reason, these kinds of dimensions do matter.

1314
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:05,320
And I could ask you to apply that to a particular city.

1315
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:11,320
70 minutes left to discuss the goals of segregation.

1316
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:18,320
So why is it that different population groups take a different part of the city?

1317
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:24,320
I guess that all of you have some kind of ideas about it.

1318
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:30,320
What will it be about what kind of explanations would you advise it that rich and poor

1319
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:39,880
and the whites, Hispanic, Asian, people of the origin, people of the cross, that they lived

1320
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,360
in a different part of the city.

1321
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:43,360
Why is that?

1322
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:53,000
>> Tell me when it comes to creation or in coming city, they will often choose the name

1323
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,320
of the book, for example, like the world age of tea, coming to come to sign for,

[ Inaudible ]

1325
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,280
You have another explanation?

1326
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:37,280
I'm in the early early days, different in the health and strength, and then the health and strength.

1327
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:43,280
Through example, teachers are concerned. A public thing in the present world, one in an area.

1328
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:53,280
Okay, so it could be about what you're able to afford and the financial limits that you have to be about, choice to live amongst people like you.

1329
01:44:53,280 --> 01:45:03,280
[inaudible]

1330
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:13,280
[ Inaudible ]

1331
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,280
>> Okay.

1332
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:14,280
>> Okay.

1333
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:14,280
>> Okay.

1334
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:14,280
>> Okay.

1335
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:15,280
>> Okay.

1336
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,280
>> Yeah.

1337
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,280
>> Yeah.

1338
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:24,280
>> There are many explanations.

1339
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:25,280
>> Yeah.

1340
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:30,280
>> And it is important for me, but I'm going to try to do

1341
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:35,880
in a very short period of time is to run through a couple of typical explanations.

1342
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,680
But I find important is that I'm showing you this crop.

1343
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:45,280
I think you've seen it already in some of the previous classes by the University of

1344
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,280
of Austin.

1345
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:53,880
And so what is important for me is that different drug workers or urban thinkers or people

1346
01:45:53,880 --> 01:46:05,880
over a human domain of students that have been coming up with different explanations, that also it matters very much from which sub-discipline that they are looking at.

1347
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:18,880
And so family and instructors have been pointing at different explanations of segregation than Marxist-chair-person.

1348
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:23,040
And so for that reason, it is important to situate

1349
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:28,040
this theory to explain segregation on this match.

1350
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,840
And my take on it is that one explanation is not

1351
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,400
better than the other.

1352
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,360
But in order to understand what is happening,

1353
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:37,520
we need to look at financial limits of people.

1354
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,920
And Marxists will have a big theory about it.

1355
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,120
And but also a choice.

1356
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,880
And it will be mostly these.

1357
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:49,880
there are the even older history childrens

1358
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:53,720
who are eager to explore the preferences of people

1359
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:57,440
and why people want to live in a particular neighborhood.

1360
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,640
And they will also then go to interview and say,

1361
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:03,040
why is it that you move subverts?

1362
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:08,480
So my point is, I think it's important that you unravel

1363
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:11,480
these different theories made up by these different thinkers

1364
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:13,520
from different disciplines.

1365
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:19,240
quantitative geographers in the 60s

1366
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,720
were not so interested in explanations or segregation,

1367
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,960
but they had a rich set of mapping tools

1368
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:29,640
to understand these spatial patterns,

1369
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:33,360
but they were not so interested in explanations.

1370
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:38,160
Ecological models, Bergus, she would go and read Bergus,

1371
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:43,400
1925 concentric solo, why do these different population groups

1372
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:45,860
and look at different parts of the city.

1373
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:49,760
Almost like you would have this pioneer fit of fit.

1374
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:52,280
So imagine the beauty area of land.

1375
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:54,780
First you would find grass,

1376
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:56,120
and then you would find shrubs,

1377
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:59,720
and as the shrubs grow, the grass cannot survive anymore

1378
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:04,120
because there's no fighting for the grass.

1379
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:05,760
And then you would get these big trees,

1380
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,000
and these shrubs can also not survive.

1381
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,920
So you would have competition amongst different types

1382
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,600
of which they should put their competition

1383
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,760
amongst different populations.

1384
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:20,440
You would have innovation to most desire parts.

1385
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:23,160
So we talk about ecological models.

1386
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:27,800
Because when you read these 100-year-old theories,

1387
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:33,960
that often you find these analogies with ecological models

1388
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:39,800
at your vegetation or the survival of the fittest

1389
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:41,400
almost.

1390
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:46,600
So ecological models they draw on theories of expansion, competition,

1391
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:49,900
in patients, your session of different countries,

1392
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:55,520
in analogy to what you find in among plants.

1393
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:59,440
For Marxist-Jokers, different neighborhoods,

1394
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:06,120
different built environments, our parts of circuits of capital.

1395
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:09,400
And so to understand why different neighborhoods

1396
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:11,560
are produced for different people.

1397
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:15,320
We need to understand the flows of capital,

1398
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:17,600
the entirety of its state,

1399
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:22,760
and look at the circuits in which this built environment

1400
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,280
features.

1401
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:30,560
For instance, I'm not going to discuss this whole figure.

1402
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,920
But for example, to understand super-binization,

1403
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:43,560
We also need to understand the archivalization regime in which this super-venisation came

1404
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:44,560
across.

1405
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:50,620
And how for example, after the second world war in Belgium, super-venisation was promoted

1406
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:56,560
by the state also because it was a start of a consumption spiral when you suburbanize,

1407
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,560
you meet a car.

1408
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,120
And so people will buy more cars.

1409
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:05,520
You will need a fridge because this local shop is far away. You will need a freezer

1410
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:11,440
Yeah, so there's a whole consumption spiral that starts when people so urban

1411
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,920
So in order to understand why

1412
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:19,260
Superventization of the millic losses was promoted in Belgium, March 36, of course

1413
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:24,920
We need to understand that a group of patients received enriched this function sport

1414
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:30,400
to understand why neighborhoods are being gentrified

1415
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,160
and to understand the rent.

1416
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:35,440
Which many of you have lost us by material thinking

1417
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:36,740
and as well that you will explain

1418
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:38,940
how this rent gets worse.

1419
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:44,080
So he tries to understand when you look at gentrification

1420
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:49,720
to a rent gets, say, well, effectively have an invasion

1421
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:53,880
of gentrifying us to borrow this word from burgers

1422
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:57,400
to understand that you need to understand the red gap

1423
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,680
and the fact that profit can be made in this neighborhood.

1424
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:03,800
So this is part of capital accumulation.

1425
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:08,320
And so radical marks as drug workers will focus on the fact

1426
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:11,440
that you have the rich in the suburbs or the jail,

1427
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,400
and the rich in this gentrifying neighborhood

1428
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:17,320
stable type understand how that fits within this process

1429
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:19,440
of capital accumulation.

1430
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,400
Their explanation of segregation will therefore

1431
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:29,400
be rooted in the circuits of capital that Harvey is trying.

1432
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:37,900
In the text by Michael Benvener, the review and the read about the neo-reb

1433
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:37,900
reb

1434
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:44,400
area, there are more constraints to people than only these financial constraints. It's also

1435
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:49,400
about discrimination and it's about the social capital that you have. Are you here about

1436
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:55,800
different resources that might be important in finding a place to it. And I also

1437
01:51:55,800 --> 01:52:02,600
the constraints that link to that. And I want to have there at the bottom is

1438
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:10,200
discrimination by people in the real estate systems for different population groups in

1439
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:15,200
in Belgium. You see that there are some significant

1440
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:22,200
and so it's not only about the financial resources that you have.

1441
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:25,200
It's also about your last name, whether that's sexual

1442
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:28,200
French or whether that is an aramic name that will

1443
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:32,200
impact often how easy it is for you to find an apartment or

1444
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:37,200
a place to buy in Belgium.

1445
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:46,080
behavioral drug efforts that are interested in the preference and the perceptions and the decision-making of

1446
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:49,720
visual. So for them to explain

1447
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:54,960
suburbanizations and affect these middle-class families move to the suburbs.

1448
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,320
They will think about

1449
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:02,960
push and both things. Why do these people prefer to leave the city? It is

1450
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:07,080
or humans, this overcrowded is the animal,

1451
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:09,480
grime, and so on.

1452
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:13,640
Why are people attracted to the surface well

1453
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,720
that are different pieces for them?

1454
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:19,920
But in order to understand segregation,

1455
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:22,040
you also need to understand the preferences

1456
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:24,400
of these different populations.

1457
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,240
It's not only about restraints,

1458
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:30,640
it's not only about capital accumulation,

1459
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:33,680
It's also about different groups of people

1460
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:36,920
preferring to live in different kinds of environments.

1461
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:39,640
Students will also be segregated from non-students

1462
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:42,000
because we have a certain, many of you will have

1463
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,880
a similar set of preferences that make you not live in

1464
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:47,640
the suburbs, I guess, but that will make you

1465
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:51,680
the closer to the university, closer to places

1466
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:53,800
where interesting things are happening.

1467
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:59,080
And then you also read in this text by

1468
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:01,240
a long time can be done.

1469
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:03,600
And there's a regular one you will also read about

1470
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,840
at the cultural.

1471
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:06,640
You can also look at these preferences

1472
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,720
through an ethnic lens.

1473
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:13,320
And for example, to explain why people

1474
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:18,000
are broken, Turkish origin in the city of Antwerp

1475
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,760
by they live in particular neighborhoods.

1476
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:24,480
You will need to understand their financial restraints.

1477
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:27,240
And they have them to be rather poor.

1478
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:32,160
And so they are forced to live in cheap parts of the city

1479
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:34,200
or cheaper parts of the city.

1480
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,400
But you also need to understand their preferences.

1481
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:39,120
And you can also look at that through an ethnic lens.

1482
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:40,720
And many of these more weapons will be

1483
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,800
either too close to a mosque or too really close

1484
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,240
to the Turkish paper or close to a halal butcher.

1485
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:49,960
And that makes that kind of a big box.

1486
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:53,960
So you can also look through these preferences.

1487
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:56,320
So if you look at these preferences through

1488
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:59,960
and ethnic lips, you could use the same lens

1489
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:03,120
to understand why more and more these more

1490
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:05,360
African families or people for families

1491
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:08,800
or for origin also move to the surface.

1492
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:13,800
That will also be a reference really to a visit.

1493
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:17,760
For example, government bail along

1494
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:21,560
who studied this in the enter of context found out

1495
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:27,320
already quite some time ago, that in these ethnic neighborhoods, as there are also people,

1496
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:32,800
they also have very tight methods of social control, so to move out of these neighborhoods

1497
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:38,760
is also to output this, to move away from the social control in these areas. So you

1498
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:46,680
could have another preference that is linked to this reference. So the ethnic cultural

1499
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:52,600
approach where you look at these preferences through an ethnic lens and obviously it can also be

1500
01:55:52,600 --> 01:56:01,160
a criticism. So if Mother and Joker first they will try to understand how housing is important in

1501
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:09,160
identity, kind of raising the truth, conceptualize yourself and the meaning that housing or living

1502
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:14,680
in a particular apartment since he is tasting them. So you see here a whole new title, they

1503
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:17,440
They clap under meaning of house.

1504
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:21,320
And how is it more than just a roof above your head?

1505
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:25,760
It's also about home and feeling at home.

1506
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:27,660
And so these post-post-mother-joker

1507
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:31,160
they try to understand segregation from this lens.

1508
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:35,520
And so they try to understand what moving to the suburbs

1509
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:40,320
means for these milli-class people who did that in the 60s.

1510
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,800
That was a thing to do if you had the money,

1511
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,560
you're reading the quote, well,

1512
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,640
and then you move to the servers.

1513
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:49,760
And so this idea of social mobility

1514
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:54,280
and showing off somehow was quite important

1515
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:56,920
in understanding why this group of people

1516
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:59,440
moved to the servers.

1517
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,080
And we can do the same for,

1518
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:08,560
for why these gender fires move back

1519
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,560
this often set them to the cities.

1520
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:14,520
It'll also be about a certain identity.

1521
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:34,520
and spend a lot of time to keep the output to see here.

1522
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:38,520
This is also something that is very much promoted by the citizens.

1523
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:45,520
And for example, skier to get these gender fibers and little phosphon, these white, little phosphon,

1524
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:55,520
the tuxion, on these pictures to get them to live in the city because it helps them to have a text space.

1525
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:01,520
So if you want to have money to spend in the city, you will need in the building system,

1526
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:05,520
you will need people currently not from the part of their ecosystem.

1527
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:12,520
And in the city, the city council can do this.

1528
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:19,520
So I'm not really making myself very clear, but the bottom line is that the social and

1529
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:24,960
of the majority of the sites understand why people end up in different parts of the city

1530
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:31,680
through the lens of identity and how we identify as people with the place where we live,

1531
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:37,920
what that means for ourself and others looking in other parts of the city.

1532
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:46,800
I've been really into these slides, yet again the bottom line for me is that to understand why

1533
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:50,080
people live in different neighborhoods that we might need all these

1534
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:54,320
feelings and then it will be about the Marxist idea of capital

1535
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,880
implementation. It will be allowed to nail

1536
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:01,440
very many resources and constraints that we have looked at. It will be

1537
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,920
about the preferences of people that assume this

1538
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:07,360
picture of the first very interesting will be about

1539
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:10,800
identity formation and what is for mother's

1540
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:14,480
geography of first-born interests. So I could give you another

1541
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:20,720
exam questions. Look at this map there, this confusion of people of Turkish and Moroccan origin

1542
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:27,120
in Antwerp. How were these different photographers explained it? And many of the explanations that

1543
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:33,760
you've given in the beginning of the... So when I started the form of the also of segregation,

1544
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:40,800
having studied five different drug workers learning some disciplines for people in different

1545
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,080
parts of what is simply cultural mistakes.

1546
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:48,240
Of course, why do we do that?

1547
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:53,400
Is because we assume that this matters and that segregation has effects and has

1548
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:55,360
cultural interests.

1549
01:59:55,360 --> 02:00:03,440
That many people have been eager to understand what was the key for a poor person to this

1550
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,440
and neighborhood that is part by whole.

1551
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:10,040
And most people who are people who are living around it doesn't matter whether you

1552
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:11,840
And that kind of neighborhood, the way that you

1553
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:14,720
as a person is in a more mixed neighborhood.

1554
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:18,560
And you have middle class, which is the same.

1555
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,560
And we're doing it.

1556
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:21,440
And we're doing it for a city.

1557
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,320
And when you have this segregation

1558
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:26,440
of legs living in a particular part of the city

1559
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:29,240
and have a wide-staking of different kinds,

1560
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:32,200
or would it be better to strive for this kind of more

1561
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:35,860
even distribution of legs and a wide-stin

1562
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:44,420
the particular city, or region tour, or young people and old people, whatever social imagery

1563
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:47,580
we used to do.

1564
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:53,580
So next week, I will not discuss patterned those segregation, causes those segregation, but

1565
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:56,340
I will discuss these effects of segregation.

1566
02:00:56,340 --> 02:01:03,700
And also, policies of social mixing that are related to them, you get to the heart of

1567
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:06,980
why doesn't matter to study this?

1568
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:11,940
Well, is we just reassume that segregation, concentration,

1569
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:15,460
centralization that is a whole ethics for the people

1570
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:19,700
that we have been talking to them for these two hours?

1571
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:25,060
So in two weeks time, another class on the ethics of segregation.

1572
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:28,980
Next week, Tuesday, feels like to end work,

1573
02:01:28,980 --> 02:01:33,980
There are various guests on the field, many of these issues as well.

1574
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:42,660
So I would forward to see many of you in a tour of the Tuesday 8th something in the real

1575
02:01:42,660 --> 02:01:44,660
So see you soon.

1576
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:46,660
soon.

1577
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:48,900
(coughing)

1578
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:51,480
(upbeat music)

1579
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:53,880
(mumbling)

1580
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:56,460
(mumbling)



# 5 Neighbourhood effects and living with diversity

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have done my best now to restart the stream.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Maybe you can ask whether it is working.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It is difficult for me to check.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I thought I had been doing what I have been doing last week.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It seemed to work then.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But I am also for those who use the streams to study.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,440
I think it makes more sense to use last year's stream,

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,760
also for today's lecture,

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,320
for those who are following now,

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,920
because I prefer to teach for the ones here,

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,120
meaning that I will be from my screen.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,880
She'll also put that on again.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,600
Or in the classroom, and that will not be recorded.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,800
And last year, I've just been streaming from my office

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,440
because we were not supposed to have lectures anymore.

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,760
So I feel that it's better to draw in lost the SZ and also for the ones who come and be

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:13,040
here today. But also in case you want to study the slides are 99% safe. So I think it makes

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,520
most sense to use lost years of live streets also for last weeks.

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Do you have any information about this tree now?

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
I think it's working.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Okay, I'll do my best to move it in that direction.

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
Okay, so let's suppose that the tree is working.

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,560
If not, everyone can rely on last year's theme.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Okay, I think quite many of you are here.

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,320
I don't know how many students I'm expected to have.

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,760
I think 70 or 80% is here.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,120
Good, the ideal of social mix.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,000
And so I thought you already,

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,040
I told you already that in many cities across the world,

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,520
there has been a concern with segregation.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
And then we're supposed,

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,360
that segregation has negative effects on poor people.

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,160
So, add that you're worse off when you're poor,

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,360
when you're living in a neighborhood where

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,760
with a concentration of poverty, rather than in a mixed neighborhood,

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,360
where you have both working class people and a good class.

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,560
Already in the 19th century,

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,720
the heydays of the industrial revolution. You have very different groups

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,480
the capitalistic bourgeoisie and the Ethiopian socialists and so both the bourgeoisie

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:03,360
and the socialists who are afraid or who are thinking that concentrations of laborers

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,200
in particular neighborhoods of the city, for example here in Brussels in Bolognese at that time,

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,160
and for it and to work in an unfair report and put it out,

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,080
that this would have negative effects.

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,040
And the bourgeoisie was afraid that concentrations

45
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,920
of laborers might lead to revolutions,

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,880
that socialist thinking would become dominant

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,000
in these neighborhoods, and that you would never

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,200
recall that people would get upstream.

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,040
And the utopian socialists, they were scared

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,280
that these concentrations of lasers would make it more

51
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,320
difficult to strive for an egalitarian society.

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,200
And so on both ends of the political spectrum,

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,000
you had people who were thinking that it

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,440
places such as Manchester or Gental Brussels,

55
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,440
where you had these new working laws, neighborhoods,

56
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,000
that this was something that to be contracted.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,920
This ideal is still very dominant nowadays.

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,840
Here you see a quote from

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,520
the Russell Scapfoe region,

60
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,720
by the old one working,

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,160
current policy of the country,

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,880
which I'm similar quotes,

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,120
stating that contrary to the American city,

64
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,000
the ideal type for the European city

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,600
is based on the mix of functions and,

66
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,280
and I think it's important to make a distinction

67
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,560
between these two things on the one hand they refer to a functional mix, meaning that

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,120
they would like to strive for neighborhoods where you have a mix of the residential function

69
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,280
of artisans and houses.

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:01,360
And for example, offices or shops, saying that well, it's not good to have neighborhoods

71
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,120
they only have a residential fridge.

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,040
And other neighborhoods where your only have offices.

73
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,240
And so we strive for a Brussels with neighborhoods

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,120
where you have a functional mix.

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,520
And the other thing, this is what we are interested in.

76
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,440
A is saying, well, we also want Brussels

77
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,080
by other European citizens who have neighborhoods

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,560
with a mix of people, poor people and rich people.

79
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,960
And in Brussels, there have been many different moments

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,800
where this topic of social mixed

81
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,600
has been on the political agenda.

82
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,920
I think there is a few,

83
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,040
but not surprised to Brussels only a month ago.

84
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,320
I might have heard of these discussions around

85
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,340
paper, was social housing estate,

86
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Unmanlyed.

87
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,600
Sorry, the periphery of the Brussels capital region.

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,080
And therefore, you have quite some media reports about crime.

89
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,800
And then the issue of, well, you have all these

90
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,320
to be accommodated on the social housing estate

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,680
in Brussels and in Belgium,

92
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,360
more generally you need to fall below certain income

93
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,520
And meaning that it's mainly the poorest of the poor that do concentrate on the social housing

94
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
instance.

95
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,440
And so then you have discussions, well, is that the good thing?

96
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:44,920
Is this not leading to this culture where crime or con- and conservative politicians would

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,760
erase these kinds of those sorts?

98
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,700
Progressive politicians would wonder, well, is that then a neighborhood where they're

99
00:06:52,700 --> 00:07:00,060
it is easy for people to climb the social building. Wouldn't it be easier to be socially mobile

100
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,620
when you are not only surrounded by other poor people, but when you are living between

101
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:15,580
and poor and rich people are like it. So beta-bles, a neighborhood in on the left,

102
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:24,460
And obviously also in the way of these terrorist attacks in 2015, there were a lot of concerns

103
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:31,900
also in the international youth, about knowledge and their reports about knowledge,

104
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,500
as they were doing as a get-up. I've been looking at the statistics. I think

105
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,860
of all the makers of the most people of Moroccan origin,

106
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,380
the most followers of Islam, but it's still less than half.

107
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,780
So in the international media, it was often

108
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,340
reported as if Mollum May was immunistic, but with only

109
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:06,060
Moroccan people and people of Moroccan origins.

110
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,660
And then you look at this example, it's not the case.

111
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,260
Nonetheless, there were some concerns,

112
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,180
hopefully, that also could be a penalty.

113
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,940
About Mollumbe being a safe haven,

114
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,100
for there is a breeding ground for their central tech

115
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,100
that you have this concentration of people

116
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:36,780
of the same origin was then the reason to be, to be concerned.

117
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,180
So both when it comes to social mobility

118
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:46,180
and when it comes to cultural integration, new commerce,

119
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,580
there are concerns, ethnicity, such as Brussels,

120
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,660
about the concentration of either two people

121
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,380
or people of foreign origin.

122
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,980
These are two different issues, social mobility

123
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,300
and social control in the future.

124
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
As I said, was there a question?

125
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,300
- So, the structure of five people?

126
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,300
- No, I am trying to explain you.

127
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,300
I'm not saying that there is a desire to plan

128
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
or supply in the social mix,

129
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
but I'm trying to explain you that in many cities

130
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,300
across the world, I will start from a couple of intelligent examples.

131
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,300
This idea of social mix is high on the whole of the knowledge.

132
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,300
memory, very to this data, most issue, and more on the

133
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,300
app to the errors, the text as to moments, where social mix

134
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,300
was highly debated. Local media in case of this

135
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,300
terrorist, the text also is informational.

136
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Um, Brussels, we move to Gint,

137
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
an informer colleague of mine,

138
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,300
that's written a nice book about gentrification

139
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,860
in the nation, in this name is a spot called Tukkau,

140
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,180
so for those who know the church and for our interests

141
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,180
that they find some interest in the literature.

142
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,100
And see a quote from an elder man of the city of Kent

143
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,380
talking about a production of Kent neighborhoods

144
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,540
such as wish support,

145
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,820
neighborhoods that have a similar history

146
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:30,220
a small make in Brussels or in Al-Terepa North in Antwerp.

147
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,240
Neighborhoods that have developed in this 19th century

148
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,860
industrial industrialization.

149
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,860
And so neighborhoods with a higher than average

150
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,580
percentage of unemployment, higher than average percentage

151
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,220
of people, also a higher than average percentage

152
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,940
of people or for an average, etc.

153
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,900
What was this elder man saying?

154
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,420
Well, when I attract young families,

155
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,300
preferably with a job, preferably double income families

156
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,580
that will improve my social tissue, my sex base,

157
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,180
and my neighborhood life.

158
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,540
I think these are different health

159
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,540
serves the dead space, something important, I'm sorry.

160
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,020
In Belgium, about 40 to 50% of the municipal budget

161
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,420
comes from local taxes.

162
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,300
Most of it is a percentage on the local income tax

163
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,220
and percentage on the income tax,

164
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,420
meaning that if you have more rich people

165
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,140
in your municipality, that you will have

166
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,500
a higher municipal budget.

167
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Yeah. The other part comes from Lent and I'll study you.

168
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,700
So why did this other amount of Ghent finally

169
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,900
for the trends? Young families prefer to leave a joke.

170
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,900
They look lost from the white families.

171
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,900
They still improve these local text things.

172
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,100
So you have more budgets for the city of Ghent.

173
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,700
But on top of that,

174
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:19,340
It's also important to improve my social tissue, and I will go further intuitive, but often

175
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:26,820
there the underlying thought is that, for example, when you have rich and poor people,

176
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,060
when you have families, really good job and families without the job that you will get

177
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:38,420
diverse social networks, for example, and that in these networks, jobs can be found for

178
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,780
people can be held with homework, etc.

179
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:48,020
So this ID for the importance to attract young families,

180
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,580
we call it refurbishment.

181
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,140
It's not only for to improve text-based obesity,

182
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,480
but also to improve the social tissue and the labor

183
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,460
of life.

184
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:07,060
In very much a similar way, we move to the city of Annenberg,

185
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,700
And we have been visiting this unperturbed port,

186
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,580
the neighborhood, the neighborhood,

187
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,680
where I think 25% of the new covers in Enter

188
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,460
passed through before moving to other parts of the city

189
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,140
and neighborhood that is quite similar to this transition.

190
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,580
So the burgers was describing in my own sanctuary style.

191
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,100
And I've been talking there about a lot of regulations

192
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,460
that affected shopkeepers in the neighborhood,

193
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:43,460
but also regulations that concern the subdivision of houses.

194
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:49,460
And you see there that in the previous government agreement in

195
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,460
Enter, it was stated that the city wants a larger share of single-family

196
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:02,460
developments in this particular neighborhood in the housing supply in order to attract families.

197
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,460
I always find it interesting to see this kind of word.

198
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,460
Often the youngster means young people of foreign backgrounds.

199
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,460
What you see here is that families excuse me,

200
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,460
what is land is funnel-in-mail families,

201
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
all of them are white countries.

202
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,460
So that is why the transformation of single-family

203
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,460
develops into smaller housing entities is not desired.

204
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
And for those who joined the mentor,

205
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,900
We have been discussing how could you support the arrival function in this neighborhood?

206
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,660
Well, then people are looking for a very cheap place to live and they will rent a room

207
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
for even just a mattress.

208
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,660
And that's what they would for the cheapest roof above their heads.

209
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,860
What you see here is that the city of Hanford is not so poor, the arrival of the church.

210
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:01,300
defines it in importance to bring another kind of people to this neighborhood, namely richer

211
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:12,180
levels. So again, you see efforts here to turn this out to an open north into the social

212
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:22,180
the mixed neighborhood where you have newcomers next to white families who can afford to buy

213
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:32,260
such a big house just for the use of one family. In the art in the art, people by

214
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,260
I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

215
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,260
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

216
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,260
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

217
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,260
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

218
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,260
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

219
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,260
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

220
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:06,260
of foreign origin, you had demolition projects and you had the creation of new dwellings

221
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:14,260
that try to cater for different audiences. And again, you see the, this is a course

222
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:22,780
from the Army Department of State, you see that the idea was that in these neighborhoods

223
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:29,020
that can be transformed, that these big inhabitants,

224
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,180
the people who used to live there,

225
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,540
were seriously disadvantaged by a rare name.

226
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,560
And the idea was that living in such a neighborhood

227
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,940
being poor in such a neighborhood,

228
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,500
accessor-based poverty makes it worse,

229
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,660
not basically living in such a neighborhood

230
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,780
is worse than living in another name.

231
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:58,820
that is only more difficult to find out a poverty in such a neighborhood of the parts of this.

232
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:07,380
So for this reason, it was a big, big and project to basically the knowledge match of the house

233
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,380
in these neighborhoods and to build new houses that cater for different audiences.

234
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,900
Slater also refers to this whole sixth program in the UK and the US sorry.

235
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:31,620
For example, Capri Nichri, a neighborhood of miles to the north of Peru in Chicago.

236
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,420
Lastly, there have been quite a bit of a Chicago.

237
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:42,420
A neighborhood with a very bad reputation for drug use and any crime and any other things.

238
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:51,780
And again what has been done there is that many of these apartment blocks that have been torn down have been demolished.

239
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:58,980
And that you houses have been built again trying to cater for other kind of hope.

240
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,700
It's trying to bring the millic loss to a neighborhood that was previously painted in evident fire.

241
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,820
And then in the situation of the SU-minded hurdle, this far geosystem,

242
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,060
where many of the original residents of the neighborhood such as that,

243
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:24,660
other voucher, and basically to give them discount on their rent price,

244
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,780
in other parts of the city trying to encourage them to move and to better off

245
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,540
neighborhoods in other parts of the ocean garden.

246
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:44,420
So again you see attempts to mix neighborhoods in the conviction that the concentration of poverty

247
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:51,620
is bad that it leads to crime and it leads to drug use and that it is bad for these

248
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,380
inhabitants.

249
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,220
South Africa? Yeah? I want to know what's going on, how come about it?

250
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:09,380
It's the... Well, I think the outcome, there are many, many papers about this and many scholars

251
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:17,780
looking at different sides of this medal, but I think in the article by Stom Slater, page

252
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:26,420
369 I see here. It is stated that no effects have been reported for a number of outcomes

253
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:34,100
and that at first effects on the delinquency and physical health of

254
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:42,020
Adorsant males in particular have been reported but positive effects on adult mental health and

255
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:48,740
education and health of young women. So it depends very much what you're looking at, but in any

256
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,980
case studies who try it and to find out like what happened to the people who moved to middle

257
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:02,740
class neighborhoods, found very at first effects and in any case one good question whether such

258
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:15,700
Well, because the project was the best one to try and improve the situation of computer and Chicago.

259
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:22,900
I will discuss the effects of such programs in more detail. But before doing that, I wanted to

260
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,180
highlight that in many countries across the world, US, UK, many built-insities,

261
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,460
and basically all over the Europe in South Africa.

262
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,420
And then step in,

263
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,940
to create socially mixed neighborhoods

264
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,700
in the conviction that segregation

265
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,780
and the concentration of poverty is bad

266
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,780
for people living in just the situation.

267
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,100
- One question, okay, yeah.

268
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,940
Why is there this idea that I can't speak?

269
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,660
Like, you know, there's a target.

270
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:07,660
[ Inaudible ]

271
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
>> I don't know what to say.

272
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,660
I don't know how to make the definition of inclusion.

273
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:18,660
In any case, I think it's another coincidence that all of these projects that you see here

274
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:26,660
are about bringing the middle class to neighborhoods which used to be predominant for

275
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,260
And the future.

276
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,020
This fire-shark program that I was just talking about

277
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,220
is also doing the other way,

278
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,900
doing it the other way around because it's

279
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:40,180
nice to bring four people to a milliposs neighbor.

280
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,940
And so this is also a project where milli-class neighborhoods

281
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,780
are also becoming more or mixed.

282
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,860
Because by giving these rents subsidies

283
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,060
through this fire-shark system, it allows people

284
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,300
and the religious people to move to a better off parts

285
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,460
of the city as well.

286
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,540
But I will come back to that.

287
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,860
For now,

288
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,140
we, it's good that you already start to wondering

289
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,900
about effects of these programs.

290
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,820
But as I said for now, it's important that you see

291
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,820
that in many parts, in many corners of the world,

292
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,260
this ideal of socially mixed,

293
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:31,260
socially mixed neighborhoods seems to be a very stable kind of idea.

294
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:38,260
And it's very predominant among policy makers, both on the left and on the right.

295
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:45,260
So on both ends of the political spectrum, you find this pretty four neighborhoods

296
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:53,260
that house people with different origins or people of different social economic backgrounds.

297
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Two questions we need to ask about this is it possible then to create social index mixed neighborhoods and then a third visit or second the second question.

298
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,260
Is it desirable to do it?

299
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,240
And the article by a little stator gives, or those stators

300
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,800
gives an historical, apparently clear answer referring

301
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,280
to this whole six program in the United States

302
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,760
and housing markets review rule in the UK

303
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,520
is stating that whatever they don't,

304
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,960
they have basically just shifted over the elsewhere.

305
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,720
This has not been a remedy to overty.

306
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,000
This has just made full people elsewhere in the city.

307
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,600
The mode of production that shapes urban environment,

308
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,160
extreme net,

309
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,440
it's referring to the capitalistic system

310
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,440
there, the system of production of capitalism,

311
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,300
produce concentrations of poverty

312
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,480
that many policymakers, as we have seen,

313
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,720
rejoice in bringing up.

314
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,120
yet, at same mode of production,

315
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,120
churning in tech produces further concentrations

316
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,640
just down the street.

317
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,240
I still remember one of my former professors

318
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,720
saying that, well, many of these attempts

319
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,320
to create socially mixed neighborhoods

320
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,000
by attracting middle class people

321
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,480
to, for example, who neighbors?

322
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,880
in Brussels has just shifted this over the elsewhere. And for that reason, the

323
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:49,560
he made this comparison with moving chairs on the deck of the Titanic. People remain poor,

324
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:56,600
which you just make them move somewhere else. But this does not improve their socio-economic

325
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,840
position. This does not help them to climb the social ladder. In the day's fight, I can't

326
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,840
all you have also seen is reference to water bed.

327
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:16,840
So when you look at that, it seems to be very hard to create a social mix.

328
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,840
The same goes for Brussels.

329
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,840
I have been referring to this article by Martin,

330
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,840
like Knee King, already in Shadow 1.

331
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:35,480
And basically what material has been doing is to study people moving out of

332
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,200
gender-ifying neighborhoods in Brussels. What happens to people who move out of

333
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,400
neighborhoods in Brussels that are gender-ifying? And basically he made a distinction

334
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,420
between different clusters of people and if I'm correct, then cluster one

335
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,300
consistent mainly of highly educated German coefficients.

336
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,300
Where do they move as neighborhoods in versus gentry5?

337
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:10,420
They move to and to work and gensh and also some of the municipalities of Plava,

338
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,420
one of them.

339
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,920
And these are municipalities.

340
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,980
These people find a joke in another city, in another part of Belgium.

341
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,980
They move out of these gentry5 neighborhoods and they move to a place closer to the place

342
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,980
and that's where it is.

343
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,980
But the tool consisted of more working-wise people,

344
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,980
people with a lower-than-average income,

345
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,980
where you then move first of all to,

346
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:45,980
well, make difficulties along the canal,

347
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,980
and such as Holland and U of Warden,

348
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,600
the home of our familiar all of you are

349
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,340
to the geography of Belgium already,

350
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,940
but these are also usability small towns

351
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,660
that have gone through a process of industrialization

352
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,860
and where humans find small houses

353
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,140
that will be cheaper than the houses you would find

354
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,060
in these gentry-fly neighborhoods in Brussels.

355
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,220
And so what you see here is that gentry-ification

356
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,420
comes with displacement, for example,

357
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,220
to a municipality such as Phil Moore.

358
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:26,300
So as you see these clusters you can find rather far from Brussels,

359
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:36,940
Cenvois, Laudien, Mols, many town cities in this 19th century

360
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,580
built for industrialization in the Indian culture.

361
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,780
So these are municipalities very much find housing for a rather

362
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:53,660
cheap price. So if you follow material by thinking this argument, then you would see,

363
00:27:53,660 --> 00:28:02,620
well, what happens here is that by trying to improve the lives of poor people in Brussels,

364
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:11,100
through creating the social mix, attracting the middle class to these neighborhoods. What you see

365
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:18,100
is that these people moved, are displaced to other municipalities,

366
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:23,100
where you also have concentrations of poor people.

367
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:29,100
But they are located in much worse situations, locations,

368
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,100
where it comes to finding a drug for it.

369
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:38,100
And so what is happening here is a shifting the chairs on the deck of the Titanic

370
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,980
over these still exists, but by attracting the middle of the loss to some

371
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:49,220
neighborhoods from Brussels, you move forward the elsewhere. To places where

372
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,860
people can afford to live, and these are neighborhoods that we have been

373
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:01,420
visiting in Isha, the Walker, and Salk. We're here buying a house or renting an

374
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,380
apartment will be much cheaper than this in San

375
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,380
actually, for some of the other genshifying parts of process.

376
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,820
This map shows something very similar for Antwerp,

377
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,940
those who joined to Antwerp by a recognized

378
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,860
its first reading, the medieval Antwerp,

379
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,860
the second reading, 19th century industrial Antwerp,

380
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,620
and what is not...

381
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,220
visualizes is a synthesis index of this advantage.

382
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,700
And you see that in some neighborhoods,

383
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,100
there are no big changes in the last years

384
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,940
in this index.

385
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,700
They are yellow, for example,

386
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,620
blue fall social housing estates

387
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,460
that we have visited the remains yellow situation.

388
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,740
There does not really change.

389
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,460
You also see other parts of the city, for example,

390
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,460
A luncheon, the area around the museum that we are doing.

391
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,940
You see that this is blue.

392
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,020
And many of the inner city neighborhoods

393
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,060
in Alberta, the North, for example, are also blue.

394
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:24,060
At the same time, you see that other parts of the city,

395
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,540
for example, medicine and dirt on the outside

396
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,600
of this 19th century, well by a sea of worsening

397
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,400
of this synthesis.

398
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,000
That's also here.

399
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Through this map, you could see that, well,

400
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,400
some neighborhoods are attracting

401
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,040
four million plus people,

402
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,800
but poverty is shifted elsewhere in the city

403
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,240
is moving to other parts of the urban region.

404
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,520
This map is just giving you the situation

405
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,000
for the municipality or the city of Antwerp,

406
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,480
that if you would include the global programs

407
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,040
of the vendor, you might see that, for example,

408
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,760
all for people to know the future.

409
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,320
Or they're high in the people region.

410
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,200
They're yet to be split effectors,

411
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,040
to be protected to the boss,

412
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,720
that you would see a worsening of the issue.

413
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,320
So we can try to attract villain loss people.

414
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,960
That's when the city of the service,

415
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,960
You can try to attract the middle of the law, so it's back to the city.

416
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:35,500
But this place is people from these neighborhoods who cannot order their

417
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,960
anymore. So this is whose poverty elsewhere?

418
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Yeah.

419
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Question?

420
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,960
[inaudible]

421
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,960
Well, I must admit that I don't go all the imitators in this specific index, but I guess

422
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,960
it will be about average income, unemployment, I may be some other indicators that say

423
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,960
something about this name.

424
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,960
But I should have put this.

425
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,840
So much of what we see here confirms this ID of Slater

426
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,840
when clicking in that well, trying to create a social mix

427
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,760
in some parts of the city.

428
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:28,560
Will shift poverty will make a poverty move elsewhere.

429
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,840
I will create, that's what Slater said,

430
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,320
will create over concentrations of poverty.

431
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,120
This is just down the street in shallow go up

432
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,960
are the case of these gentry flying neighborhoods of Brussels, in bone for the gentry flying.

433
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,760
So that's where in medicine, in Berlin, in other parts of these urban regions.

434
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:02,560
There are examples in the world where mixed neighborhoods are being created.

435
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:10,640
But then it's only possible when city councils or governments can have a serious

436
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:19,240
impact upon who is living in specific neighborhoods.

437
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:28,600
In some parts of the world, scholars write about conclusion that we housing or inclusion

438
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:35,800
every zoning forcing for example real estate developers who devour a high tower

439
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:44,380
full of apartments to dedicate a certain percentage of these residents

440
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:51,160
residential units to people who fall below a certain income threshold and so

441
00:33:51,160 --> 00:34:01,880
you can create a social-emixed neighborhood. If you force real estate developers to

442
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:13,080
well in a newly built project, you have a certain percentage of apartments,

443
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,360
of four people, of the certain, in people, are fully low-surfing in countries.

444
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:26,120
In Enter, I've been talking about this Catholic's neighborhood. This was the land of the port in

445
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:36,120
public hands. And so, this is the council could also sell this land to developers with a lot of

446
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:46,440
conditions. And so, developers could buy this land under the condition that they built 25% of the

447
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,440
There is digital units for social housing, 15% rent, 10% to buy.

448
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,440
And then they reserved 50% of the units at affordable prices.

449
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,440
And that was not very affordable, but at least you could not ask whatever you wanted.

450
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
This prices could not skyrocket.

451
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,440
You could not ask whatever you wanted for these residential units.

452
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:19,040
And so you could argue, a socially mixed neighborhood has been developed here almost from

453
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,520
scratch because only it's white.

454
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,480
The looks that you see here are new and only the brown ones exist.

455
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,680
But that was possible because the land was public owned and could be sold to developers

456
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,560
under the condition that the reserve is kind of.

457
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:47,120
it's for certain degrees of people. And I make a look who is able to rent or buy these units

458
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:56,640
without in case you can follow a certain income threshold in order to be able to be eligible

459
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:07,280
for the social housing. Yes. The same goes for this affordability criteria. I don't know how

460
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,040
what was the price exactly. But I see here that you could earn up to 58,000 euro of

461
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:21,900
family, almost 4,000 euro added for each additional person. So we are buying quite high

462
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,880
incomes already. But the bottom line is that these developers could not just build whatever

463
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:34,440
they want. That they need to meet certain criteria and that they also need to serve

464
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:41,640
Why the British number of units for people belong to different income units.

465
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,920
At the lowest income, the degrees, social housing, and then the points of house to work.

466
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:56,200
So, a socially mixed neighborhood when it comes to income, when it comes to poverty and wealth,

467
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,640
could be created. But that was only possible because there was a serious intervention

468
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,440
of the Sydney Council in this.

469
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,240
In Belgium, the government or public authorities

470
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,440
are not really able to intervene that much in housing.

471
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Because it's only days of blasters, 6% of the units,

472
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,680
which are social housing.

473
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,160
In Brussels are 10% and all the risks,

474
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,320
the development sessions, minor exceptions,

475
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,400
all the rest is the market.

476
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,200
It's either people who are home, house,

477
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,280
or people who rent the house from another market.

478
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,840
But there are cities across the world

479
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,560
where you have 50% social house in that workshop

480
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,440
or under the dump is another small,

481
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,800
a high percentage of social house.

482
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,920
That also means that as a council,

483
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,600
you can be to be quite a bit in who it is where.

484
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:07,080
in the dodging days where 90% of the people need to find a house or accommodation on the market,

485
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:13,400
you will see that attempts to create a social mix quickly lead to displacement and quickly

486
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,400
lead to concentrations of poverty elsewhere.

487
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:25,640
And this is very much the dependent on how this particular house mix looks like and how much

488
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,640
because the councils can interfere in the housing.

489
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
(mumbling)

490
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:44,640
- So it's a place?

491
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,640
- There has been a time when the social housing association

492
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,640
sold out of the white, some units, that they know it is.

493
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,640
In any case, there's no research.

494
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:04,640
And these type of files are a project for the developer.

495
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,640
This question will be, I will be in the chat.

496
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,640
As long as they can still make profits, this is possible.

497
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,640
The same goes for this inclusion of housing.

498
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,640
as long as the developer is able to take profits, then this is also.

499
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:33,640
In this case, I know that the developers have to pay a lot of money to sit and get this piece of debt.

500
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:43,640
And because they were also asked to cater for these public sectors, they had to develop the parts and the streets.

501
00:39:43,640 --> 00:40:01,640
And they have to say that in the local social house, to the city quit it very much more money by selling this piece of land for the highest price to develop and to build a sparkles for the obvious people who chose to do things different.

502
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:08,640
And there are many parts of the world where we have this kind of skis.

503
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Yeah.

504
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:18,640
[ Inaudible ]

505
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:26,640
[ Inaudible ]

506
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,640
[ Inaudible ]

507
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Okay.

508
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Is social mixed feasible?

509
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
The answer is yes.

510
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,640
In this feasible, it is possible to create socially mixed neighborhoods,

511
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,640
but it is very hard to do that in a situation where the market rates,

512
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,640
and because then trying to attract middle-class families

513
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,640
who are poor neighborhoods will lead to displacement of poor families

514
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
to other parts of the country.

515
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,640
In this case, that will not happen, because you reserve

516
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:10,640
25% of the neighborhood to people who fall below a certain interest zone.

517
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:17,960
And as long as these units are social housing, these 35% will remain there for this

518
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
population.

519
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:31,200
So you allow people to live in a neighborhood where 50% belongs to

520
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,780
a village loss from the upper middle of the class and 25% of these units goes to a

521
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:44,120
baby, which people can afford to spend one million here or one.

522
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Another question?

523
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,120
Yeah, I have a question.

524
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,120
For instance, it would be like,

525
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,120
social takes early in this one,

526
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,120
for instance, areas, areas of the city.

527
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,120
But then when in this view, I'm asking for an example, actually,

528
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,120
can't wear a capitol of the city.

529
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,120
For example, for keeping, I mean,

530
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,120
just from experience,

531
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
to work out, I don't know,

532
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,120
for example, usually if you are,

533
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:19,120
like very up-to-date luxury, the lane there are so affordable and so powerful.

534
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:27,120
However, this has been changed if it's given up to a track.

535
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,120
So it might be different people of different things from the system.

536
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:41,120
But then the general effect was actually that it's upper class and the capitalist developed.

537
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:48,520
It's not like actually the people who are living there beforehand and maybe I could reserve a

538
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:55,920
It's a good question. I think in this case

539
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:03,720
People who lived there were just a fish that were ready that was not so much the case yet because you only had a couple of hundreds of people

540
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,120
You develop a neighborhood for thousands of people

541
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,120
It was a neighborhood that was more true than it was.

542
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
That was not so much worse.

543
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,620
Just, I guess it was, of course, like,

544
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,120
when there's a, when there's an example of

545
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,120
gensification, people all around it,

546
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,120
and not really attempting to solve.

547
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,120
They're trying to

548
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:40,480
[INAUDIBLE]

549
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,320
Well, I guess it depends how you will argue the 100th.

550
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,520
Also, you would say that your vacation goes with displacement

551
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,960
and displacement with the essential part of the change of education.

552
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,240
In this case, there might be a displacement

553
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,480
of the people who lived in these brown houses.

554
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,600
And who lived there already before the rest of the neighborhoods,

555
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,960
before the white parts of the neighborhoods,

556
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,480
were being concerned.

557
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:16,480
But there will not be a place in these 25% units,

558
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,360
which are either rented out or sold as social house.

559
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,140
Because you will need to fall below a certain income

560
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:30,220
order to buy or rent these goods. And no matter what happens in the rest of the day's

561
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:38,940
request, the students will still remain like reserves for people following those income

562
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,860
threshold. So this is a way to make sure that these places will not happen. Even if you

563
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:53,020
buy these kind of, you will not be able to sell them, and if you rent them out, then this is

564
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,220
There's also another condition that's followed below.

565
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,940
So it's just the average.

566
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:03,140
But it's only applied to the red part here.

567
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,140
Yeah, indeed.

568
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,780
That's the current moment.

569
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,420
Everything else at this whole area has been

570
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,860
identified that has been over-renewaled in this whole area.

571
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,340
So it's only in that very small part,

572
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,780
where they were able to create a solution.

573
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,580
So this is the my area of it though.

574
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,620
Is it really achieving a solution?

575
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,620
Yeah, one important thing is to scale the scale of which we discuss things.

576
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:33,620
Now we are talking about a very small scale neighborhood of a couple of thousand people.

577
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,620
But indeed, if you discuss it at the scale of Enter,

578
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:45,620
then you will see that this whole area around this red square that we've just been talking about has been going through

579
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:51,420
and improvement of this, this advantage in mix and has been going through

580
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:58,780
at, at very strong gender education. Sorry, that's, they're completely just a

581
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,820
fairly fair film. I don't need violence. I'm sorry. But then I'm just curious

582
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:09,060
how it works here. Like, um, due to the private health, we can get tax based

583
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,780
or like, and it's from the government or the YH.

584
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,300
It's from the government because I was a member.

585
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,180
Well, I don't know about these these

586
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:20,260
thanks for your base, but for sure the length price

587
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:23,500
for which they were able to acquire this.

588
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,300
Well, the price for which they were able to buy this piece

589
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,700
of length from the city council was much lower

590
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:36,180
than it would have been just a market with a firm.

591
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,140
OK.

592
00:46:38,140 --> 00:47:08,100
Okay, is it yeah more questions? Okay now we move to the next question. This

593
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,100
is it good or bad?

594
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,980
Is it desirable to create such a name?

595
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,180
Now, I'm going to say in the globe,

596
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,100
the kind of shops that you find really good with that.

597
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:24,260
The most big caters for the needs and the desires

598
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:28,700
of this 75% of residents and a lot of tourists

599
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,860
and visitors who like to visit the market.

600
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,380
And so that could be a reason to say, well,

601
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,740
it's not desirable to do this.

602
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,540
because these people will not find cheap food in the area

603
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:46,300
for the kind of problems they would like to buy.

604
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,180
But that shows that we are moving to the next question,

605
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,500
the social mix desire.

606
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,580
I guess it would be time for a break.

607
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,340
I'm running a bit behind some into.

608
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:05,340
I'm wondering there is a three hours or a decade

609
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,960
to over-joker.

610
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,620
Boston has been limiting by Boston powers.

611
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,200
We've been big for all, we have a goal of its power

612
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,700
just two hours and one for us.

613
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:23,740
Okay, I'll just go to the slides.

614
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,140
We'll see, we'll see what time, what time,

615
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,620
but I think it's better to have a great job

616
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,540
before moving to this next question.

617
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:39,540

00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:13,400
segregation. They have also been using different research mental

742
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:21,280
colleges. We use large surveys. They have a survey of 1,000 people in order to

743
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,240
answer these questions or do you have called it negative research where you

744
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,300
the Interfuge Thirds Fellows,

745
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,740
and we're 13 people living in a thing,

746
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,060
or this place from a thing.

747
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,640
So different research,

748
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,540
mental politics,

749
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,240
and then you've also been reading

750
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,700
in the article by Adam Slather,

751
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,100
that that might also be different ideology

752
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,460
under things,

753
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,500
underlying the work of these different.

754
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,860
So I think it is important for you

755
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,140
to understand that just like I,

756
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,500
I could last week for the courses of segregation

757
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,180
and the different arguments that have been given

758
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:06,620
for why people live in segregated neighborhoods.

759
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:10,500
And also when it comes to these effects of segregation

760
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,100
as a role that's been showed around that

761
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,460
that people are working in different conditions

762
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:19,780
and different sub-disaboots of human geography

763
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,020
have been giving different answers

764
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:26,500
to these questions.

765
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,660
Another remark that I want to give before going

766
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:36,180
to the answer to that question is that it is important

767
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:41,260
to see that studies on neighborhood effects

768
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,620
bear birthmarks.

769
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,980
What do I need with that?

770
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,660
Is it matters to bear a study of the eclipse?

771
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,860
And then often, for example, the literature

772
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,900
of the effects of segregation.

773
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,820
Conducting studies conducted in the United States,

774
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:02,700
the conclusions of these studies have been used, for example,

775
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,780
to influence policy in Western Europe.

776
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:11,480
And a while it is quite important to see the differences

777
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,620
between these different contexts.

778
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,940
Last week, I have been highlighting, for example,

779
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:19,340
that when it comes to desegregation,

780
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:27,340
in the United States, the United States is much stronger or prevalent than it is

781
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,340
in Europe.

782
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:34,100
So there's an important difference when you take the conclusions from one country to

783
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,100
the other.

784
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:42,060
The welfare states in Western Europe has been much more developed than in the United States.

785
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:47,300
So when it comes to poverty and the eradication of poverty, this is a completely different

786
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,880
issue in a Western European context.

787
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,900
And this is an American.

788
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:59,840
So it's important that you contextualize studies

789
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,300
on segregation in the United States, for example.

790
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,780
And then just to not transfer these conclusions

791
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:11,060
to Europe.

792
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:17,820
Many of the studies on neighborhood effects

793
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:22,740
and the effects of segregation have been conducted in the Netherlands.

794
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:27,820
And also this Dutch context is a very peculiar one.

795
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:31,940
Where, for example, concerns about the value,

796
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,980
and also to see there, or particularly neighborhoods

797
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:39,260
in Amsterdam have been quite important in stimulating

798
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:47,260
research field. And being for dying, I don't know whether you're interested in going.

799
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:55,260
But this far-right whole addition to the Netherlands have always been proper for two decades already, have been kept forward.

800
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:03,260
And that's also important to understand why this research field has been sort of developed in the Netherlands.

801
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:10,780
So important to provincialized students and to understand that a study in Vienna or in

802
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:16,620
Antwerp or in Brussels or in the United States that it's important to contextualize,

803
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:21,180
to understand the specificities of this particular context.

804
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:26,700
I have seven answers to this question.

805
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,700
Have you remember the question?

806
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,820
Can impoverished neighborhoods make the residents

807
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,700
worse off or when I'm interested in

808
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:38,220
ethnic cultural segregation and neighborhoods

809
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:43,020
with the concentration of people for origin

810
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,180
make integration more difficult?

811
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:52,220
Um, seven different arguments.

812
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:55,180
The first one, the social network

813
01:02:55,180 --> 01:03:03,180
I think many of you might have heard of Robert Pootman, focusing on social capital,

814
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:08,300
but the social capital, the connections among the visuals, the social networks, the

815
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,300
norms of reciprocity.

816
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:15,860
There's the rules of desiring and trustworthiness that arise from, making a distinction

817
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:20,020
between holding capital, what is falling capital.

818
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:27,020
These are social methods, connections, loans, or reciprocity that means socially homogeneous

819
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,180
people.

820
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:34,820
For example, people of the same ethnicity are people of the same social and economic group.

821
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:39,780
Distinction between only and bridging them of the preaching of the capital, being connections,

822
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:46,060
that works, loans, and reciprocity, and transporatiness, being socially heterogeneous.

823
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:53,940
For example, people of different ethnic countries are people of different social economies.

824
01:03:53,940 --> 01:04:00,420
And the argument is often that rich in capital is important for social mobility.

825
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:09,260
And for example, if you're poor from your middle class neighbor, you will meet here about

826
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,260
jobs.

827
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,260
And it is a version who's working.

828
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,680
And there is a job opportunity that

829
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,680
office workers, persons, persons in my chair is

830
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,460
knowledge, but she might share it with his

831
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,460
worker name.

832
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:26,720
Work and ready to do not speak Dutch, it might

833
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,920
be good to have this wide middle class

834
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,520
family, this university council.

835
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,500
So interested in living next to you, because

836
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,200
you maybe they can help yourself or go

837
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,720
with homework as they speak.

838
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,120
So these are the ideas behind this argument,

839
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,760
saying, well, it's good to have mixed neighborhoods,

840
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,880
because this mixed neighborhoods with leads to heterogeneous networks

841
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,520
that will lead to bridging capital,

842
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,160
and that will make importance.

843
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:05,520
That will be to the benefit of poor people living in such an effort.

844
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,520
And so one reason why you would want to create a social

845
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,320
expert is because you want to create heterogeneous social

846
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,440
networks.

847
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,720
Because you assume that rich in capital will help poor people

848
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,920
to be socially mobile and to join with it.

849
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,920
And for example, through education or through jobs.

850
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,280
And so this is one of the seven arguments

851
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,440
that underpins this ideal of social works.

852
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:41,320
But I'm going to study how people live.

853
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:46,320
It turns out that people are rather mobile in a city

854
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:51,160
to not limit their lives to a particular neighborhood.

855
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,200
And that many of the social networks

856
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,800
that people in a neighborhood spend

857
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,840
different neighborhood borders.

858
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,200
And this is a study from Guangzhou in China.

859
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,720
looking at the social networks of people living in four different types of

860
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,960
neighborhoods and in each of these neighborhoods the conclusion is that most

861
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:23,760
people get to know people through work and spend time with colleagues also after

862
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:31,600
after working hours. Many people also get to know people through kinship from a

863
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,600
childhood to schools of

864
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
graduate children.

865
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,600
And then are actually quite

866
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,600
a small amount of

867
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,600
social mentors in each of these

868
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,600
neighborhoods, less than that

869
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,600
percent.

870
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,600
And, well, you look at the

871
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
social connections of these people.

872
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,600
There's quite a small amount that

873
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,600
helps in these neighborhoods.

874
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,600
And no matter the reach of the four

875
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,600
types of neighborhoods that

876
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,600
People seem to develop mostly boats,

877
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:11,600
connections in that works with people from outside this language.

878
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,600
And so this idea that by bringing the middle of the last work,

879
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,600
the middle of the last two of the middle of the neighborhood,

880
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,600
that this would be a way to create these social networks.

881
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:27,600
And when you look at this, then the social networks also develop outside.

882
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,600
So why do you focus so much on that neighborhood that people live?

883
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:38,600
I'm just very

884
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:43,600
[inaudible]

885
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,600
In other countries you mean

886
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,600
the situation would be different.

887
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:56,600
I told you it's important to understand the complex

888
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,940
and the context of this study.

889
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,760
But in any case, also for which

890
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,620
that European cities, if you're

891
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:06,120
a study, this process is over time.

892
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,800
I think you would find out that

893
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,360
connections are less neighborhood-based

894
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,560
than they used to.

895
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,120
I can imagine that this neighborhood

896
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,080
is more than being an organ.

897
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,640
People still get to know a lot

898
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:23,240
of other families, for example,

899
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,240
through their children, through the school,

900
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,520
in many countries of the world.

901
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,040
You have a school kitchen system

902
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,840
where living in a neighborhood

903
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,880
and sending your kids to the same school.

904
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,400
And so for sure there are many reasons

905
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,520
why this would be different in other countries.

906
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,240
Have an overall, I think this argument is still true

907
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,400
that there are also many social networks

908
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,440
that have outside the neighborhood.

909
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,400
Of course, I also studies that focus on

910
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,480
foreign neighborhoods and say,

911
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,440
well, these people are less mobile and rich people.

912
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,440
So it's exactly for the school people that this neighborhood is an important

913
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:06,440
ground of network for each. Much more than this one, which you know.

914
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:17,440
If you do not have a joke, if you do not have the money to buy a best-in-game club, that is neighborhood context will be a form of form for social networks to develop.

915
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,440
So also for different countries, people this might be.

916
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:27,240
But still I think it's important to see that that merge is another one we've felt inside

917
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,240
the paper.

918
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:36,980
That there are also networks in other parts of the city, or with people living in other parts

919
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,680
of the city.

920
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:45,860
German, drawing, white, double-inkled,

921
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:51,840
families to a neighborhood such as molar make.

922
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,240
And here is possible, well, then

923
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:59,480
make these networks, a study by Sabina Rick

924
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:04,360
and like a un-person in German cities.

925
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:09,040
I think it was not explored in the food area.

926
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:13,380
And they have been interviewing the white,

927
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:17,620
middle class people in this example to women

928
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,180
about their social net.

929
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,880
And there's quite a lot on this diet,

930
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,980
everybody might need to explain it.

931
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:25,460
So you see they're women in the middle.

932
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:30,260
And then you have different scales in the neighborhoods.

933
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,580
You have the city.

934
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:35,140
You have Germany, and you have outside of Germany.

935
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:40,140
So people who are the important people in your life,

936
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:44,440
ask that, and if you put them on this diagram saying,

937
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,800
well, there are people inside the neighborhood,

938
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,280
people living in the same city,

939
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,400
but you also know people in the same country

940
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,640
and people also being grown.

941
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,520
And for different people, you would get to different diagrams.

942
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:01,520
Then what they also did is to map contact frequency.

943
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:08,400
So if you have frequent buildings, this arrow will be born both then it is for people through

944
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,200
you to have rare contacts.

945
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:19,880
And then they also have met a level of education and indicators for class in the Indian

946
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
countries.

947
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:28,320
So you will learn these people that you frequent are they people with the same educational

948
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,320
background.

949
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,960
They would cost people high education,

950
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,160
high-educated, or artists people who do not have

951
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,080
any personal qualifications for this one.

952
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,240
Now, the other thing that you see here

953
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,720
is the type of relation to a frequent

954
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,320
these people or really provide you with emotional support

955
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:51,640
or instrumental materials or a good talk,

956
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,760
or example, how to be used in poverty.

957
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,680
So it's quite a complex map.

958
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:02,920
So what you see is that first of all, just like in the Chinese example, many people have

959
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:09,200
social networks, there are Bartovus social networks with people living outside the neighborhoods.

960
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:15,400
And what you also see there is that most of the connections that these middle-class women

961
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:22,000
in these under-religious neighborhoods develop are with other people with the same

962
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
education qualification.

963
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,200
So the idea that bringing the middle of class people

964
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,400
to an underprivileged neighborhood

965
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,720
will create that an routine is social networks

966
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,520
in which you're finding more enriched people.

967
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,720
There's no single whole truth here.

968
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,320
There's a middle class people that's

969
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,360
you're attracted to these neighborhoods.

970
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,560
The eight mostly social bonds with people like them

971
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,760
with other middle and false people.

972
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,440
And so this bridging capital,

973
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,120
That was the reason why you wanted to exist,

974
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,280
neighborhood.

975
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,680
That's not really the problem.

976
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:04,080
Another argument is that creating a mixed neighborhood

977
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:09,080
might disrupt the strong dice that exist there over it.

978
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,240
The bolding capital that exists

979
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,600
and the strong forms of social economic,

980
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,280
emotional support that people are the same,

981
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,600
that Mississippi, for example, provides you

982
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,180
when they live in a neighborhood,

983
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,600
part of the city.

984
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,440
So residents living in distant parts of cities,

985
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,400
slaves are argued, fall back on what they know,

986
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,480
and what they have each other,

987
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:40,840
this building can also be crucial in the life's home

988
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,240
for people, in the lives of newcomers,

989
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,760
where just arrived to the city,

990
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,240
they were looked for all that excursed,

991
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:54,960
And if you create a mixed neighborhood in these parts of common, for example, by attracting

992
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,800
the middle class, there will display some people and that will disrupt these bone-in-capped

993
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,840
open-assists.

994
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:10,440
And so what I'm trying to do is to say, well, there is an argument there, why you would

995
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:14,440
to create mixed neighborhoods, which are also left

996
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,680
a couple of cancer arguments.

997
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,680
That's the why this argument is

998
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,560
by not to work or to hold a reason

999
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,760
and applying the argument to my not to work.

1000
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,200
Social networks, social capital,

1001
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,600
owning and bridging capital.

1002
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,720
I guess you have a few kinds of points there.

1003
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:38,560
The second argument is called under-place arguments.

1004
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,700
And this is an argument that has developed in the United States

1005
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,620
in the 1980s.

1006
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:50,100
And then finding that there was a big discussion

1007
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:55,100
between structuralists who looked at the causes of poverty

1008
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:57,820
in the declining economic base.

1009
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,060
And for example, Marxist, Trevor first saying, well, there

1010
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:06,380
is a shift from a forest to a post-fortress capitalism.

1011
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:10,180
And this makes it harder for this people to fight with chocolate.

1012
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:15,180
or the arguments that you've heard in the classes by the past of our polarization,

1013
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:19,180
is there a declining job market for this.

1014
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,180
So you look for structure of a goal of a scope forward.

1015
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:25,180
And on the other hand, you have culture groups,

1016
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:30,180
except poverty is dead because you have a culture of poverty.

1017
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:34,180
That poor people have certain attitudes,

1018
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:38,180
have a certain behavior, and this keeps them in poverty.

1019
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:43,020
there was an important discussion between these two.

1020
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:47,060
And this under-class argument is part of this cultural

1021
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,420
history of looking at forward.

1022
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:53,820
And whom is this under-class?

1023
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,660
They're not talking about all four people

1024
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,860
in the case of the United States.

1025
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:02,900
In the 1980s, 33 million people were not.

1026
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:06,580
Who was this under-class that was a minority

1027
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:09,660
in this minority, 5 million people.

1028
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:13,860
And people who follow below the income threshold

1029
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:17,260
for which they are like considered to work.

1030
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:20,780
This proportionally black and spelling minority

1031
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:23,580
in this poor minority, but what defines

1032
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,780
that's not so much over the ordinary base,

1033
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,180
but they're behavior.

1034
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:31,940
They're throwing lawlessness,

1035
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:37,480
to reduce out of record words, lack of a warm and welfare dependency

1036
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,320
for school faith.

1037
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,440
That is sort of this culture, this lane to the poor,

1038
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,380
to be poor because of their own behavior and very

1039
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:49,520
able to do this.

1040
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,680
And so this is this under-class argument.

1041
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:58,160
So what is the argument exactly that in kettles or in neighborhoods

1042
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:04,160
So you find the concentration of two people that you find is more than an employment, more

1043
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:11,680
welfare dependency, more early school living, more truancy, more criminality, more drug

1044
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:18,600
abuse, more alcohol abuse, more out of rent with birth, more teenage pregnancy, more

1045
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:26,700
dysfunctional values, whatever, that in June to socialization effects within

1046
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:35,320
these things, if you grow up in a neighborhood like that, then your peers, people of

1047
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:44,420
your age, the people that you're free and grow at a higher chance to be criminals or

1048
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:49,100
or gamblers or drug users or alcohol abuse, etc.

1049
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:54,420
And that is why in such a route you find more on this.

1050
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,340
You also find a leg of role models really

1051
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,940
junk without a drug without an alcohol

1052
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:05,300
prediction and who are not the age followers, etc.

1053
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,860
So there's a leg of those are the role models.

1054
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:12,580
And you also have this peer group effect.

1055
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:17,260
And so why are you worse off living as a poor person

1056
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:20,460
in a poor neighborhood, the argument of this culture,

1057
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:24,980
this was, that is because you have these norms,

1058
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,820
you have a lack of these role models

1059
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:30,380
and you have this peer group that makes it made that,

1060
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:34,980
well, that's why it's your worst off living in them.

1061
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,460
And I also referred to physical structure,

1062
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:41,660
the solution of that works, the argument was, no.

1063
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,980
This has been quite an important argument.

1064
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:49,060
Many policymakers have been facing or helping

1065
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:53,500
argue in first-person countries because of this.

1066
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:59,020
Because they were convinced that living in an appornable

1067
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:02,060
group increased the chances that you

1068
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:05,100
found the job-less important thing.

1069
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:09,940
These schools early and because of your friends doing the same,

1070
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:14,100
you up to school because your friends met you so as well that you would

1071
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:18,180
turn into a criminal because this is the example that you have seen most

1072
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:21,460
they have already put that set up.

1073
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:28,180
Okay now even when there would be a link between what is on the left and

1074
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:32,180
the spoon neighborhoods then it can still be wondered whether that what is

1075
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:37,300
the causal relationship between these two. Here on the map you have

1076
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:41,900
She's got her again since we are getting quite familiar with.

1077
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,420
You see the poverty level in this neighborhood.

1078
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:50,340
The darker the reds, the poorer the neighborhoods are.

1079
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:59,020
And you see people arrested for drug use or the

1080
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:04,020
or the conversation of authors.

1081
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:10,260
How you see there is that there is a correlation

1082
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:16,620
between over D and the concentration of over D

1083
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:20,580
is neighborhood and use of one of your while there, right?

1084
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,020
Go getting the scratch scanner, which more is patterned.

1085
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:32,020
But you also see that in the other neighborhoods where you have a concentration of poverty

1086
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,020
that this much less begins.

1087
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:46,240
And I can also wonder to what extent this graph is the result of real drug use or the

1088
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,240
policing of these standards.

1089
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:54,380
If you have a police force that is much more on the outlook for drug use instead of the

1090
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:55,500
the name of the Goodswell bank.

1091
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:59,500
It's logical that this will show up in any step distance.

1092
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,940
So there are many reasons why one could raise

1093
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,700
concerns about the goals of a relationship.

1094
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,940
In this case, we could introduce, on the one hand,

1095
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,380
and the concentration of over-theon public

1096
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:14,420
on Goods, as Dr. Kritis says, like, how

1097
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,060
these statistics came about.

1098
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:18,780
One can also see that for certain drugs,

1099
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:22,180
there seems to be a correlation from other certain health.

1100
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:28,580
So I can also see that you have concentrated poverty that corresponds with a lot of errors

1101
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:33,380
for drug use, but that you also have neighborhood with concentration concentrated poverty

1102
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,380
or less, which means.

1103
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:40,020
So there are many reasons why we would start a question whether there is a real causal

1104
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:45,980
relationship, a relationship, a concentration of poverty on the one hand, and all these

1105
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:51,540
other indicators here on the slide on the other hand.

1106
01:21:51,540 --> 01:22:01,220
And another argument against this under-class argument would be, well, again, socialization

1107
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:05,500
be these peers to not only live in these neighborhoods.

1108
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:10,760
These role models do not only live in the neighborhood, but where I go back, but also

1109
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:18,260
in the neighborhood, that we can get this role almost 23 or the music that we're going to

1110
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:22,900
So why is focused on the neighborhood again?

1111
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:27,900
Third argument, the social cohesion argument.

1112
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:36,820
Here you see the basic line of thought of this argument,

1113
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:41,380
when ethnic minorities live isolated from native touch,

1114
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:44,260
they have less contact with native touch.

1115
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,860
Consequently, they do not acquire

1116
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:51,500
an adequate command of the Dutch language are not likely to adopt

1117
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:56,620
Dutch laws, values, and will not succeed in social recognitions.

1118
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:04,540
So, you can see a mixing of arguments about ethnic segregation and social

1119
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:10,300
economic mobility, saying that well, if you're lived in a neighborhood with a high

1120
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:16,220
concentration of people of foreign backgrounds to speak their mother tongue

1121
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:20,220
and we will be able to speak in touch.

1122
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:25,220
And if you have less contact with native Dutch people,

1123
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:30,220
then you will not acquire an adequate command of language.

1124
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:33,220
You are not likely to adopt Dutch moments and values,

1125
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:37,220
and therefore you succeed in social networks.

1126
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:43,220
And other arguments that has been quite important

1127
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:48,220
In the kind of rethorex and the kind of discourse of policy makers

1128
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:52,220
that are advocating a social mix, same for example,

1129
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:55,220
it's not good that in wall make you have a high-down

1130
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:59,220
situation of firms or in both the larger, high-down situation of workers.

1131
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:01,220
Why is that not good?

1132
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:03,220
Well, these people will not get to speak.

1133
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:08,220
Touch and they will not integrate to use that word.

1134
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:12,220
They will not adopt touch laws and values

1135
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:17,900
and that will make it harder for them to climb to social weather.

1136
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:22,260
Again, one can wonder, yeah, is it only in the neighborhood

1137
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:27,380
that people could get a chance to develop this kind of relationships

1138
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:31,420
with native Dutch human arguments to talk to.

1139
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:34,300
We could look at these research, too.

1140
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,060
I'm not going to do all the details that they say about you.

1141
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:42,700
home, that's a place where people develop social networks.

1142
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,840
You've got leisure,

1143
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,460
you've got digital,

1144
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,740
you've got mental health,

1145
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,100
social networks,

1146
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,340
you've got work,

1147
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,060
and you've got the transport between

1148
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:52,060
these three different domains.

1149
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:55,020
So it's important to look at all these domains

1150
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:57,740
and to see what happens between people.

1151
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,820
And then you might see that this neighborhood

1152
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,820
in which these people live is less important.

1153
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:05,940
Another counter-argument with focus

1154
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,620
or is a local culture.

1155
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:11,060
It's only because you have a concentration

1156
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:15,260
of people who are certain ethnic background, for example,

1157
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:20,260
that you can support the show that sells ethnic products

1158
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:24,540
and sell the food, that sells the food from the home group,

1159
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:28,780
where it allows you to have the church or a association

1160
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:32,060
that focusing on a particular ethnic group.

1161
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:35,420
And these kinds of places might be very important.

1162
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:37,540
they will act as a perfected space,

1163
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:39,540
they will act as a safe space,

1164
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:42,140
in which these people feel like they're home.

1165
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:44,900
And this feeling of belonging might be very important

1166
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:49,900
for them to find a life in this new country

1167
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,300
where they are living.

1168
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:55,900
The social cohesion argument.

1169
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:02,420
Before the argument, we'll focus on local services.

1170
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:11,340
And we'll say that, for example, in neighborhoods

1171
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,140
with the concentration of poverty that you

1172
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:16,740
will have less public and private services.

1173
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,220
There will be less shops.

1174
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:21,060
There will be less banks.

1175
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:24,140
And you might also have less public service.

1176
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:27,940
These are examples from Luvibong, social housing

1177
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:31,460
estate that I've been talking about today already.

1178
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,940
and the closure of a bank.

1179
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:37,420
And there is no ADM anymore in other papers.

1180
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:39,300
And the argument could go well

1181
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,660
if that would be more middle to false people

1182
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:43,860
than there would be higher interest

1183
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:47,340
from banks who have an ADM in the bank

1184
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:52,500
or other shops.

1185
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:58,260
Chicago, food deserts, I don't know

1186
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,900
that you've ever heard about this term.

1187
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:05,740
If you look at healthy food, grocery,

1188
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,220
shops, American, you find that,

1189
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:13,220
if you see a map with these different racial groups,

1190
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:17,980
remember this self identification in the case,

1191
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:22,140
America that deserve each racial group to self identify

1192
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,780
with the United States.

1193
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,380
You see neighborhoods, predominantly white,

1194
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,820
like Hispanic Asian, a nurse,

1195
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:32,660
and you see that in many of these blank neighborhoods,

1196
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,980
which are also luxurious neighborhoods,

1197
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:38,060
you find that it's very hard to find.

1198
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,780
Healthy food that's very hard to find fresh vegetables

1199
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,980
and fruit, because these shops are so fine.

1200
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:47,260
And so the argument would be that its better degree,

1201
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:49,940
it makes neighborhood, because that will attract

1202
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:54,940
a library set of shops and services to these neighborhoods.

1203
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,940
We've already been talking about this,

1204
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,860
that the question of course is what kind of shops

1205
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,900
and what kind of services do you get

1206
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:08,020
in the case of this end to our advantage of this street

1207
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,120
one person said, well,

1208
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:12,260
the people will not feel affordable shops

1209
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:14,340
and they will also not find the products

1210
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:16,860
that apply to five shops.

1211
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:20,420
That's also in gentrifying neighborhoods

1212
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:24,980
and what kind of shops do you find there?

1213
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:31,660
as it shows catering for people who look for the cheapest or possible because they have

1214
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:41,300
only five heroes to spend in the last three days of the month, or visit cafes or restaurants

1215
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:46,420
who try to cater for these incoming, tenured pups.

1216
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:53,460
So it's important to look at the difference in the amount that will result from creating

1217
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:59,020
and so the question is if you mix name routes through these shops and services

1218
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:04,980
cater for these cool people because if there's something case then it will

1219
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:10,040
displace the shops that existed there already and that cater for these

1220
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:15,900
audience. The answer we've also been talking about all of these specialized

1221
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:23,060
services that you might get in neighborhoods of Rhode Island at these ony transfer

1222
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:30,060
or a full shot set of African vegetables or high ingredients.

1223
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:36,060
And the question is if you try to mix the neighborhoods,

1224
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:42,060
do these kinds of shops and these kinds of services still be able to be to remain

1225
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:49,060
or will they also be displaced because this place will be involved by a fancy

1226
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:52,820
see, probably shown that it's mainly

1227
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,820
catarities and changing farmers.

1228
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:58,820
So questions around shops, services,

1229
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:03,260
catering for different audits.

1230
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:06,540
A fifth argument that you find in the literature

1231
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,820
is a political one.

1232
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:13,060
Start from the observation that many neighborhood associations,

1233
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:18,060
for example are mainly run by middle class.

1234
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:23,500
And that middle class people are much more vocal

1235
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:26,620
in expressing their concerns from the paper.

1236
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,580
So I'm gonna say that, well,

1237
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:32,260
by attracting the middle class to a poor neighborhood,

1238
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:33,700
this neighborhood will be higher

1239
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,180
for the political agenda.

1240
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:40,700
And I have this quote interprome

1241
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,860
and I have read at the end of the excursion,

1242
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:44,900
which I've got a lot in my channel,

1243
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,340
for people stating,

1244
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:49,340
"Well, there also gets paid or sliding to this."

1245
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,660
To us.

1246
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:54,220
And so the idea is that I'm mixing neighborhoods,

1247
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:57,980
you will put these neighborhoods higher.

1248
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:02,980
Jen, I'm in Belgium, people from outside the youth

1249
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:07,500
with other buildings in Oxford are able to fold

1250
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:13,420
this film not getting case in every country, so if you have a neighborhood with a lot of people

1251
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:19,500
from outside the group, who do not have a say in vocal politics, then why would this

1252
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:26,780
vocal mayors address the concerns of people living? And if these people are not able to

1253
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:33,340
express their needs and to put a stamp on the vocal agenda, but why would you do it?

1254
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:40,860
So the argument is that really class people are able to have these connections with politicians

1255
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:43,340
or at least they will be listened to.

1256
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:56,540
Well, I'm not going to go into that example, but it's out with the enter of highway

1257
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:00,940
that issue of air pollution to be observation

1258
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:04,300
with both of the paper groups lying next to the library

1259
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,580
are up.

1260
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:08,300
So one would question what would happen

1261
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:12,300
with this whole issue of the only dates around the highway.

1262
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,140
If these neighborhoods would want to,

1263
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:17,460
to neighbors, the voters would come,

1264
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:19,260
the broader than they would be the highest

1265
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:23,540
if they would be the show that they did.

1266
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:27,500
So the political arguments by mixing neighborhoods,

1267
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,540
you will put that higher on the political agenda.

1268
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:34,100
Of course, the issue is that why we put the issues of this,

1269
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:38,020
who even, why does that not have priorities

1270
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,420
made for the result of the political agenda,

1271
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:44,780
without these middle-class residents.

1272
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:47,100
The sixth argument is a bit different.

1273
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,860
The spatial mismatch does not focus so much

1274
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:52,980
on the issue of segregation.

1275
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:55,820
But if you follow these five dimensions of--

1276
01:32:55,820 --> 01:33:04,860
We see a benefit it focuses on concentration plus red doe pool people live in which part

1277
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:10,340
of the city are these neighborhoods with the concentration of poverty.

1278
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:16,540
This is a diagram from Cape Town but in old London it's still very much the case.

1279
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:23,820
Where do you have a job of her students in white and where do you have population?

1280
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:28,220
where do people live and where do they, where, where could they?

1281
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:34,620
And most of the drug opportunities are still in the previous new white neighborhoods, particularly

1282
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:37,820
in the central business district of Cape Town.

1283
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:44,540
But most of the poor people in Cape Town are living by far away from these places.

1284
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:49,860
So there is a mismatch between the places where they live and the places where they could

1285
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,660
potential, burning.

1286
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:55,260
And so it's not just important to focus on segregation

1287
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:58,300
and the fact that poverty is concentrated

1288
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,540
in these more peripheral neighborhoods

1289
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:02,220
in the case of big dive.

1290
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:04,500
The genetic focus then also of distance

1291
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,740
between various neighborhoods are

1292
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:09,180
and the places where these people put through.

1293
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:11,260
So there is the spatial mismatch

1294
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:14,620
are focusing on the mismatch between

1295
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:19,060
place of residence and potential places of the world.

1296
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:28,320
Rest in European cities, then to have a better public transport than most American for

1297
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,320
cyber.

1298
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:34,500
So one of the other big issues is argument to the whole list through in the case of Brussels

1299
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:41,000
for example, even if you live in a field world, there are good train connections to

1300
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:53,320
of nature places. This is a meant for Brussels, Joe Ben City, you see two clusters, the inner city,

1301
01:34:53,320 --> 01:35:01,560
and all these offices, and the area around the airport. Where the poor people in Brussels

1302
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:09,160
lived mostly in this 19th century, boats around the inner city, meaning that there's not so

1303
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,120
So much of the spatial mismatch.

1304
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:15,560
If you live in all of make, you can walk to many job opportunities.

1305
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,960
Of course, the question that this barely

1306
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,800
have most guilt job opportunities.

1307
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,240
Or if you don't need all of communication,

1308
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:27,480
then you see that more or less the same clusters

1309
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,000
appear.

1310
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,320
Of course, as jokes shift towards the airport,

1311
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:36,120
the issue is what are the transport connections

1312
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:40,880
between Wollumbeg, St. Joseph, the Wollus, and Joseph,

1313
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,880
and these areas where you find the growth

1314
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,360
of most new, or most new jobs.

1315
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,560
And in the case of Brussels, the issue will also be,

1316
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:54,880
whether the language requirements for these jobs,

1317
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,280
because these are Joseph flowers,

1318
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:02,120
what kind of a touch proficiency to a need,

1319
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,960
and also for these jobs that are repulsion, French,

1320
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,240
and you also English, so just language wise,

1321
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:13,160
these jobs are already quite difficult.

1322
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,880
So the spatial mismatch argument focusing

1323
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,960
on the location of these poor neighbors.

1324
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:23,440
So it's not just how mixed these neighborhoods are,

1325
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:24,920
whether poor and rich, they decide

1326
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,680
by side, but where do these concentrations

1327
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,000
of overty occur?

1328
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,600
Last argument statement is each,

1329
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,400
And this is an argument that Slater has been writing about

1330
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,840
is important to look what happens outside

1331
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,560
of these neighborhoods under scrutiny.

1332
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:47,680
And why is it harder to climb the social weather

1333
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,920
and body of it on all of the developments

1334
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,720
because teachers who live outside these neighborhoods

1335
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:58,200
from where the set of stereotypes or pupils in these schools

1336
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:02,640
and that will look different at the same educational

1337
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:06,760
chances as people going to school in other meetings.

1338
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,200
Or if you're both going to this, and you know

1339
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,800
what is the post-code report, what made with you,

1340
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,480
apply for a joke, then you, okay,

1341
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,320
you're one thousand meters.

1342
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,600
If you have a driver, a joke, and this is your address

1343
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,280
is there, then potential and borders

1344
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,960
might already come to the center of stereotypes,

1345
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,000
why not too high?

1346
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So why would it be good then to create the social mix?

1347
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:36,320
Well, one could create a one-point argue for a social mix

1348
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,080
because that will reduce the stigma of attitudes

1349
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,680
or the stigma attached to this gap.

1350
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:47,520
Of course, there might also be other ways

1351
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,440
to work on that stigma.

1352
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,040
You don't need a mix to do that.

1353
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,880
You also can make people living outside this neighborhood.

1354
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,120
So you can make that more air off.

1355
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:00,760
And what this really happens is silence and the difference.

1356
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:03,880
There's a bit of stigmatization, life of nature,

1357
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,360
employers or teachers or police men

1358
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,760
who are working in this neighborhood,

1359
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,480
but who do not live there,

1360
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:16,280
will be another argument to buy social mix is necessary.

1361
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:22,520
So are people living in impoverished prisons?

1362
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:25,160
Well, doesn't matter whether you are poor,

1363
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:30,720
mostly poor neighborhoods surrounded by people like you.

1364
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:34,720
or whether you live as a poor person in a mixed name.

1365
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,960
Just that matter.

1366
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:39,120
And our seventh arguments that I have given down

1367
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,120
as to why that could matter.

1368
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:44,480
For each of these seven,

1369
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:47,360
I've also given a couple of counter-audicates.

1370
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:52,000
As to why I creating a mixed,

1371
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,640
it should be a bad thing to distract,

1372
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:58,280
to advise that exists already.

1373
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:04,200
are is not necessary because people find peers and role models outside the environment.

1374
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:13,960
For people with a class, people arrive in these neighborhoods, well not create social networks,

1375
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:19,320
different people, this better order, etc. So for each of these arguments, I've given

1376
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:29,480
a couple of counter arguments. What about the privilege? I will skip that. But in

1377
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:37,000
those data spaper you will find many arguments for that. I will get to a small conclusion.

1378
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:45,800
Okay, so when we discuss this ideal of social mix, when we discuss the question of

1379
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:50,360
which is social mixed feasible, is social mixed desirable.

1380
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,840
Now, when it's my take on it, I think,

1381
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:55,040
of his home and we,

1382
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,600
who has been doing a lot of vertical housing

1383
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,160
here in Brussels,

1384
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,160
has summarized this quite well through.

1385
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:05,480
The concept of social mixed here runs,

1386
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,920
which now legitimizes a good part

1387
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,440
of the regional interventions

1388
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:14,120
in the area of housing here in Brussels,

1389
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:17,120
just looking at the Brussels step of the region

1390
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:20,600
and how the idea of social mixed-minded concept

1391
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:25,620
of social mixed-

1392
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:29,880
is occurring to a very non-spading conference,

1393
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:33,720
the gentrification reaches underweight

1394
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,840
in the central neighborhoods,

1395
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:40,520
in those neighborhoods where these authorities are doing

1396
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:44,760
in a big effort to attract valid possible products.

1397
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:48,120
Indicates that when there is a mix,

1398
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:53,120
it is only a prelude to the eviction of the most disadvantaged

1399
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:56,200
fire the mechanisms of a completely

1400
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,440
deteriorated real estate market.

1401
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,600
Really in a city,

1402
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:06,600
where only 10% of the total residential units

1403
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:14,320
our social house, and there is almost no control over the remaining 90%.

1404
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:25,280
And so if you try to attract little class residents to these 19th century industrial labor books

1405
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:30,960
around Brussels, if you do that, then it will push out over the elsewhere. You see that in the

1406
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,560
the snap of a tree, where there are these poor people moving out of a gentrifying

1407
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:42,200
nature, started it both to build on to oust, to really get into the hollow, to

1408
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:48,920
shower the water, to my shadow. Yeah, you move over the elsewhere. So when there

1409
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:54,160
is a mix, you can exist for a while, but then it's only a privilege to be a

1410
01:41:54,160 --> 01:42:00,200
fiction of most is a fantasy. Because rents will go up eventually. And these poor

1411
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:03,440
people that live there are not able to afford these rents,

1412
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:07,320
they will need to move elsewhere to find the next mistake.

1413
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:11,880
So this social makes feasible in the case of Brussels,

1414
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:17,680
with very little control of authorities on the housing market.

1415
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:21,080
No, this is not feasible, shall we?

1416
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,480
Is it desirable?

1417
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,560
A second question that I asked.

1418
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,080
Even if this eviction could be a forked,

1419
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:35,120
And even if you think of a situation where at much, 25% social housing everywhere, 50%

1420
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:39,760
and you will not evict these poor people from these neighborhoods,

1421
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:47,280
then she argues there is nothing to indicate that these disadvantaged populations would eventually

1422
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,480
benefit in any rate from these nips.

1423
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:57,920
F1 because the attraction of this middle league penalties will change the shops for

1424
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:05,360
a regular, will not lead to these heterogeneous networks that these policy makers three

1425
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:05,680
and off.

1426
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:16,320
Yeah, will not lead to the kind of social cohesion that underlies this social cohesion.

1427
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:23,840
does not make the kind of role models that people who

1428
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:27,200
believe in the spendery class argument

1429
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,760
who are looking for, et cetera.

1430
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,720
And so she's arguing in the case of Brussels again,

1431
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:36,320
it's important to revitalize these studies

1432
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:39,120
and to understand the complexity of the Brussels case

1433
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:43,840
only 10% social housing over the at this moment

1434
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:47,200
concentrated in neighborhoods with quite a critical

1435
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,160
very close to these jobs.

1436
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:54,240
And so there are many particularities that we need to understand.

1437
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:58,160
But what is arguing is that kind of social mix

1438
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:01,200
that this person's capital picture tries to create

1439
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:04,160
leads to the displacement of people,

1440
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,320
to neighborhoods, to parts of the city,

1441
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:10,760
which are much less connected to job opportunities.

1442
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:15,360
I refined much less jobs and services that paid the for this.

1443
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,360
That's right.

1444
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:20,720
So to much worse locations actually.

1445
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,600
And even if this kind of mixed could be realized,

1446
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:27,320
she argues, then this is not desirable.

1447
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,840
Then this advantage population will not benefit from this.

1448
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:34,200
This will not help them to plan the social better.

1449
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:38,200
As she will draw on all the seven counter arguments

1450
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:44,240
that I've given to substantiate this claim.

1451
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:56,080
So, well, I think when you, I remember that I once asked an exam question such as

1452
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:01,560
"would yourself you choose all the manner of N-word, do another manner of N-word, but

1453
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:06,600
you verbal against social mixed policies or not?"

1454
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,800
The question was a bit more complicated.

1455
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,460
I think it's important that when you have such a question,

1456
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:16,600
when you have a group for a city already

1457
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,960
who has discussed this from an academic point of view,

1458
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,880
I think there are a couple of questions

1459
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:24,040
that you need to ask yourself.

1460
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:25,120
Yes.

1461
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:28,000
The first one is whom are we talking about?

1462
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,880
Why do we treat?

1463
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,320
Why do we want to create a social mix?

1464
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:37,080
Isn't because we say, well, this is the interest

1465
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:42,080
under privilege or I've skipped now most of this at heart.

1466
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:45,080
The class could also be interested in the privilege.

1467
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:48,080
I mean, I'm a member of the original Scout,

1468
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:53,080
one of the richer, richer richest municipalities of Belgium

1469
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,080
and some of you said well,

1470
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:58,780
it could be good to have some more diverse

1471
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:02,080
years because people like, for example,

1472
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,080
change the way they think about people

1473
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,360
they have some of them living close by.

1474
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:33,880
You see that all of the arguments so far have been dealing with the unknown group. So for that reason, I think it's important to ask your question, what about the crucial questions. And in the discussion, seven years that we as next week, there will be one paper that happens together with the real male and post-galbert, they could deal with the question. So we have a chance to come back to the issue.

1475
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,120
and we have discussions.

1476
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:41,920
Do we only focus on social economic segregation?

1477
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:46,240
Are we also interested in ethnic arguments?

1478
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:47,600
And you're seeing, for example,

1479
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:52,080
a social cohesion argument, the two are conflated.

1480
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,640
So do we want to create a social mix

1481
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,960
in the interest of ethnic minorities

1482
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,720
or does that have a majority,

1483
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:04,180
that still exists because more and more cities

1484
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:08,500
in Belgium do not have a majority of people.

1485
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:11,940
So we also think about this group,

1486
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:15,980
frankly, to problemate such policies.

1487
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:20,020
Are we interested in the several residents who

1488
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:23,460
are there already, who are we mainly thinking

1489
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:26,620
about few cops for the horizons?

1490
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:29,340
So I think this question for whom

1491
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,440
So we want to create a social experience.

1492
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:37,620
And most interests is the first one that you should ask.

1493
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:41,700
A second one is the issue of scale.

1494
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:43,940
I told you last week already, scale

1495
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:45,860
is the crux of the matter.

1496
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:49,100
If you want to calculate segregation finishes,

1497
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:52,420
it matters that we scale, we do so.

1498
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:55,220
In Belgium, we have the straightest small statistical units

1499
01:47:55,220 --> 01:48:01,140
for that reason, we find that that's high levels of segregation.

1500
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:04,540
And if you would make these statistical units bigger,

1501
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:08,060
then that would be less segregation.

1502
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:12,140
Your comment about the red square relates to this.

1503
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:16,380
We can create a social mix in this very small neighborhood.

1504
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:19,500
And if you would look at the bigger picture,

1505
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,740
if you would look at this A-monch in area of emperor,

1506
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:26,460
as well as all the news found out that there is no social business,

1507
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:29,540
it's mostly relative to a certain level.

1508
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:33,380
So I think scale is a very important issue,

1509
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:38,660
as well as the question where do we want to create a social business.

1510
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:43,340
I think that most of the social mixed literature

1511
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:46,660
is concerned with this disadvantage, neighborhoods.

1512
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:49,180
The focus is on these neighborhoods

1513
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:51,420
and the need to create a social business.

1514
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:57,420
If you would look at all the make, you would look at social economic position of people.

1515
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:02,300
If you would look at ethnic maker of this neighborhood, you would find out that the

1516
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:09,100
whole make is maybe the most social image's name roots of Russell's original culture.

1517
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:15,700
And the most of the homogeneous neighborhoods are white suburban municipalities.

1518
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:19,780
So why are we only concerned with this disadvantage

1519
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:20,980
neighborhoods?

1520
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:25,420
How are we not concerned with the homogeneity

1521
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:28,300
of many of these suburban groups?

1522
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,820
Which are better off.

1523
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:33,860
Is there a need to create a social mixed slope or not?

1524
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:36,940
And I've imbed a shout for those who join to enter by

1525
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:39,620
be talking about the way they protest that they

1526
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:42,820
can't stop training against the local asylum center

1527
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:51,260
against any attempts to make this an usability.

1528
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:54,900
One good even argued that most of the literature and most

1529
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:57,740
of the concerns of policy leaders

1530
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:02,180
target only those this advantage neighborhoods,

1531
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:06,420
which are change-refiable, which have the potential

1532
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:09,460
to attract really close newcomers.

1533
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:11,180
Because that's good for them.

1534
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:15,740
Next, then the question becomes rare is this possible.

1535
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:19,500
And then enter, we have been on the triangle,

1536
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:22,260
square, bowling plank.

1537
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:28,260
But if you look at the houses, there are many fancy houses,

1538
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:33,260
which are potential homes for rich families.

1539
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:38,740
If you move more to the north, you only find

1540
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:43,160
very small houses which will never attract this kind of.

1541
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:46,020
Rarely I have debates about social mix,

1542
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:49,220
about the needs to gentrify neighborhoods well.

1543
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:50,700
Only in certain,

1544
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:54,560
you know, limited amount of this is a factor.

1545
01:50:54,560 --> 01:51:00,460
So I think this rare question is an important,

1546
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:04,500
rare, are we interested in data social issues?

1547
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,540
You know, notice that these discussions focus

1548
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:09,140
of a very limited number of neighborhoods.

1549
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:15,420
Another issue is never discussed in other parts of the city.

1550
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:19,540
It's also important to look at the issue of scaling

1551
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:23,700
already discussed that, here again, many of our maps

1552
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:27,700
only focus on and for the Russell's capital region.

1553
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:31,620
But I've told you that many of these waterbed effects

1554
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:34,740
have consequences in other parts of the urban region

1555
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:37,300
or even other parts on the bench.

1556
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:40,260
If housing prices in Brussels, Europe,

1557
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:43,840
this has effects in

1558
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,240
shall I want, this makes us walking around in

1559
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:48,420
my shape of hope and see the poverty there.

1560
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:51,220
And for we go to the proposal,

1561
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:54,280
the filmmaking French, quite far away from Brussels

1562
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,100
and we see these effects there,

1563
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:58,140
or need over needed care.

1564
01:51:58,140 --> 01:52:01,060
All these municipalities are affected

1565
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:03,580
by this gentrification.

1566
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:10,580
So it's important that we discuss this issue at the scale of at this deep urban region.

1567
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:18,580
So for whom, in whose interest do we want to create social mixed layer?

1568
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:19,580
Do we want to do it?

1569
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:22,580
Which neighborhoods are we actually talking about?

1570
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:27,580
And then I think it's also important to focus on this wide question.

1571
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:34,540
If you want to create a social use to counter-operatively or even to stimulate the

1572
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:41,340
sculptural integration, then I think that there might be many policy alternatives which

1573
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:46,940
are less costly and which may have much bigger effects.

1574
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:54,940
I'm not going to go too much to do this, but you can imagine that you can try to combat

1575
01:52:54,940 --> 01:53:04,700
poverty, not through the spatial intervention, but through other kinds of social and welfare

1576
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:12,700
that's correct. Is it to improve the local text bits? We've seen this course from this elder man

1577
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:18,860
who gets, I think for many dozens, it still will be an important one. Why do we find gentrification

1578
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:27,900
important. And why do we want to attract the middle class to the city? It is because then it's good

1579
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:35,260
to learn our views of budget. But then even then, I will always be this very coloring of this is

1580
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:41,420
in the interest of who people have included. And this will eventually help them by the social

1581
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:46,780
that. Create social mixed-to-counter racist or

1582
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:53,060
pluses stereotypes. What will that mean? I guess that would mean that we would

1583
01:53:53,060 --> 01:54:00,300
rethink rare and for whom we try to create a social mix. You see that in most

1584
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:08,660
of the policy discourse this is quite absent. If stigmatization is one of

1585
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:19,660
other reasons why living in Poland or for a government or come to a different world makes your life more difficult than other parts of the city.

1586
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:22,660
It's a bit about stigmatization and discrimination.

1587
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:28,660
Now what kind of spatial interventions can be needed to counter these stereotypes.

1588
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:33,660
I think you would create social mixing of the three different ways.

1589
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:45,100
So this is a bit of an open ended conclusion with a lot of questions, but I hope that by giving

1590
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:52,720
your arguments for social mixed and cancer arguments against and by encouraging your

1591
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:59,620
to think about the context in which you want to create a social mixed or not that you

1592
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:07,460
are able to think critically about the effects of segregation and needs to create a social

1593
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,540
mix or much.

1594
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:19,220
And five plus seven, I propose that we almost leave it here for now.

1595
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:24,900
We still have time to discuss all these issues next week in the seminar.

1596
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:29,300
All these texts will deal again with patterns of segregation

1597
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:30,980
and the effects are safe.

1598
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:36,300
So I think it's good that we have time to discuss this next week,

1599
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:41,620
Monday for the geographers and the people from planning

1600
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:44,260
and have our students.

1601
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:47,180
Is this information correct?

1602
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:51,780
Next week Monday, we have eight papers in presentations

1603
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:53,700
to discuss.

1604
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:56,260
I don't see any comments.

1605
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:59,540
So I suppose that this is the schedule as it is.

1606
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:03,580
And then next week, Tuesday and Thursday,

1607
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:09,100
we have two other seminars for students from MUSH

1608
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:11,860
and Thursday students from four cities.

1609
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:14,740
Yeah?

1610
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:16,540
Is that correct?

1611
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:19,500
Yes, all your presentations are there.

1612
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:20,860
You find your names.

1613
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:29,540
This is the information that I've learned from the ovens, 10 minutes.

1614
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:35,540
And we will need to be a rather strict, more distracting,

1615
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:43,420
that's maximum, especially having eight presentations in the first

1616
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:44,540
seminar.

1617
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:52,260
But also in the other seminars, I prefer to keep the time and

1618
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:55,260
through limit these presentations to 10 minutes

1619
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:58,360
because otherwise there's nothing applied for discussion.

1620
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:01,860
These are discussions and not presentations.

1621
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:05,040
So, limit your presentations to 10 minutes

1622
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,920
include a slide with title, names, email,

1623
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,140
I don't know all of you, so it's important

1624
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:12,940
that I'm able to mark the presentations

1625
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:15,620
and connect with the script arise students.

1626
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:18,780
Remember that I need a core report or argument,

1627
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:21,740
a link with the required readings.

1628
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:25,040
Remember that we also expect all students

1629
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:29,540
who have read all the papers of the required readings.

1630
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:32,240
So I suppose that Slater has been read

1631
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:35,180
by thanking all of our gentlemen and dessert.

1632
01:57:35,180 --> 01:57:38,860
And then they spoke a gentle vibe of children.

1633
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:43,860
And then important in order to not to lose too much time

1634
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:49,060
with technical issues, I would like all of you

1635
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:54,900
to send to our power ports or ETF or whatever you're going to support your presentation.

1636
01:57:54,900 --> 01:58:01,900
At least 30 minutes before the seminar, to my email address, whether we transfer link to

1637
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:09,060
necessary, if you want me to check with the presentation, perhaps on my computer, it's

1638
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:13,060
a seven-year, but I suggest you to do that.

1639
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:19,060
So maybe already evening before, and then ask me if you check with it, the power of

1640
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:23,560
one's bird's room, doing it in a PDF so that the different power of one's versions

1641
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:26,760
things change my eyes to change.

1642
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:32,760
At least then, before the presentation, so there are items I'm to present in the future,

1643
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:41,560
so let me go to the sign with the sorting of laptops and the laptops that can't make

1644
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:49,760
a connection with the screen. Just to make sure that we are all able to present,

1645
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:55,160
let me have time to discuss the papers and then we also allow us to discuss everything

1646
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:56,660
that has been said.

1647
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:59,660
and lost it.

1648
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:03,660

and we are trying to teach by the information. And then we are going to have a question. And then we are going to have someone with a question. And I guess I am going to say that we are going to do that. And then we have a question. So, we have a question. So, we have a question. And then these people have been added to the list.

1665
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:14,100
Okay, yeah, but I've always did the toughest of one guy.

1666
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:19,100
She had emailed through 40, two or thousands of kids.

1667
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:22,100
She said, "Well, I can't assume the flight."

1668
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:24,100
And it's a good list.

1669
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:27,100
Maybe that could be a main death.

1670
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:30,100
Yeah, who knew her, but I could show her.

1671
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:34,100
If not for next week, then for...

Okay. Yeah.

1695
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:01,100
I'm wondering if I want to get my work on the other hand.

1696
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:02,100
So yeah.

1697
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:06,100
I think I get the answer from Adam, for example.

1698
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:08,100
That's what I think.

1699
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:10,100
But maybe.

1700
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:11,100
Yeah.

1701
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:12,100
That's what I think.

1702
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,100
Yeah.

1703
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:17,100
My mother was in the schedule and I felt like it's the...

1704
02:03:17,100 --> 02:03:18,100
But that was the last thing.

1705
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:21,100
And I wanted to schedule for a run.

1706
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:23,100
These students as well.

1707
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:26,260
but also it's things when I see it.

1708
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:29,700
So I don't know how to use these blue key.

1709
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:31,300
Yeah, sounds.

1710
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:32,300
Okay.

1711
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:35,500
So I can go through the window below.

1712
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:36,500
Okay.

1713
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:37,500
Okay.

1714
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,100
We're on this side.

1715
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:40,100
Yes.

1716
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:41,100
Thank you.

1717
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:42,100
Thank you.

1718
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:45,100
I want to--

1719
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:46,100
I want to--

1720
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:47,100
Okay.

1721
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:50,700
I'm actually thinking about we have to write for four

[INAUDIBLE]

1730
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:11,700
So the first thing is, can we

1731
02:04:11,700 --> 02:04:14,700
call like any project that aims to attract

1732
02:04:14,700 --> 02:04:19,700
and the quality of life in a neighborhood like this.

1733
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:25,180
Don't blame the taxi in this kind of project.

1734
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:27,780
Can we call the our social mix projects?

1735
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:30,920
- But they also have a project.

1736
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:34,220
So, we should also say that that's 100%.

1737
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:36,100
That's a little.

1738
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:43,100
Or, or, if still that, not really just.

1739
02:04:43,740 --> 02:05:10,920
infr

1740
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:22,920
and so we're seeing that people are too busy, they're important to attract another guy and he's seen this.

1741
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:30,920
So then you can see that this is what things are.

1742
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:39,040
Do you have any few have already some references that talk about Brussels when I feel

1743
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:45,100
I'm also in the presentation I've not shown that there is quite a rich video of

1744
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:46,100
your opinion.

1745
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:49,060
So if I look at this big result I will find some more.

1746
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:53,880
Well I think you will find a lot of all my beautiful benefits from ownership support policies

1747
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:57,480
in Brussels that's where this quote comes from.

1748
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:00,920
And Madhu van Krikeen moving in out of Brussels.

1749
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:07,080
Madhu of his work is on gentrification, but you also see that some of his papers deal with social

1750
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:12,440
mixed and relation to gentrification specifically. So there's a lot of work.

1751
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:22,520
And the other thing that I don't know if I'm mistaken, but I have the impression that

1752
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:29,320
There's not actually evidence that some people actually are like you presented some arguments,

1753
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,560
but they're not pretty.

1754
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:34,920
What advice is it's already?

1755
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:37,320
Well, I love superstitions and...

1756
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:42,680
Well, I think that if I'm given an old paper, just why they could show me,

1757
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:49,720
trying to find out who can be the effects and showing that there are some pieces where

1758
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:56,440
people might benefit trust. But even then, especially for all these

1759
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:01,640
only the two best creation of mixed neighborhood. What's quite costly?

1760
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:05,000
Yes. What would have a few wins? Just a nice

1761
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:09,320
structural problem. Yes, if you would use all this money to

1762
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:12,840
a triangle not over a conflict with different.

1763
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:17,840
And so even if it turns out social networks,

1764
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:22,840
I think it's a good experience.

1765
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:27,840
But yeah, so even if it turns out

1766
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:32,840
by creating social mix you improve the situation,

1767
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:36,840
people, aggression groups, and this, what would that be?

1768
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:39,840
So it would try and...

1769
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:46,840
[inaudible]

1770
02:07:46,840 --> 02:08:09,840
>> Yes, and back for five. >> Yes, and back for five. >> Yes, I think. >> The military. >> I think it's fine. >> In ruling, schools, schools, schools, schools. >> Okay. >> Thank you very much. >> Thank you very much. >> We have also planned to discuss next next. >> Yes, I think.

# 6 Cultures of urban research

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
[ Inaudible ]

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
[inaudible]

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Welcome everyone.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Good evening.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This certainly is my favorite time of the day to teach a course.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
At 5 p.m. time we start at 8 a.m. so anyways.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Welcome to our social geography or urban geography depending on your exact type of enrollment.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,260
I am bus fan who often don't know me yet.

9
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,560
And I'll be here, let's say, your lecture for today's session

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,640
and next week's session.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,720
For some reason, because I had started the web stream

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,400
on, but not for some reason, I received emails

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,640
from individual students asking for permission

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,800
to gain access to the panop to web stream.

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,760
I gave everyone access until a minute ago,

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,960
now I'll stop.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,480
So because I have to teach at some point.

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,560
So if you receive, let's say messages from your fellow

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,680
students who cannot attend, the reason is that they arrived after five,

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,360
five, and it gets started. But if all goes well, the recording will be

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,800
recorded and uploaded, it went wrong. It appears like you today because of

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,200
the pan-up to technical difficulties, but hopefully will manage today. I might

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,160
close the window at some point, but it might help to get some oxygen in

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,280
here. So feel free to also open windows at the end if you refer.

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,200
Well, it comes with two sessions.

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,160
As with some other courses, we run, especially,

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,320
let's say the big introductory master level courses.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,560
Burbing social geography, urban geography,

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,640
is a traumatic course.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,000
So it tries to give you an insight into different, let's say,

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,480
teams around, let's say, concerning,

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,240
let's say, different takes on urban geography.

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,480
I would personally prefer to call this course,

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,800
urban theory, because I think we do more than just geography.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,480
But the basic idea is to give different,

36
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,280
sexual and analytical perspectives on how to study or how we can study here.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,320
My role in this course and I guess also in my own research specialty is I'm the cultural

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,360
guy so I tend to focus on more cultural issues so I'll be talking you through most

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,720
today and next week Monday to let's say cultural approaches to studying the urban.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,880
Today's session, oops, here we are.

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,360
Today's session is really, you can see,

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,760
an historical overview.

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,960
In the sense that I want to go through some discussions

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,240
which you might know, or either,

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,400
let's say, in generic terms,

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,680
or rather specifically around,

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,600
let's see how, let's say,

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,160
thinking about, let's say,

49
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,560
cultural approach towards urban has been informed,

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,640
let's say historically speaking.

51
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,920
So we're going to go through a number

52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,320
of, let's say, historical steps.

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,680
Many focusing on, let's say, the impact

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,960
sort of thinking about the post-modern asset. It seems like all TATs seems like all

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,960
information, it's certainly in the way that it's not used when this kind of

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,400
terminology except maybe a journalistic media but certainly not academically. As

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,880
been speaks for the last 10 years I wouldn't say that the post-modern has been

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,040
the main obsession for let's say for research but I would argue that much of

59
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,040
what has been discussed from the 1980s onwards more or less around the post-modern

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,360
has already is still being let's say dealt with or no using a different vocabulary.

61
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,000
This is what you would often see is that the terminology, terminology is my change,

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
but if you open, that's adapted more historical answer,

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,160
you will see that some of the even-doer terminologies have changed,

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,480
then that's the underlying or as a content,

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,120
the substance that behind terminology has remained the same over many, many years.

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
So not everything is new, even though you use new terminology.

67
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,620
So today's more historical session,

68
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,920
we see a historicized approach in the case.

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,360
Next week, it's, I mean,

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,520
relatively cold urban cultures,

71
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,840
but they are going to sort of give you

72
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,000
a number of perspective,

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,080
let's say on a relatively

74
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,680
contemporary approach towards studying

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,280
the urban from a culture of perspective.

76
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,640
I will not give a definition of culture.

77
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,760
I mean, I'm not, I mean, so that's a lost task.

78
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,960
It's not gonna work.

79
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,160
and I'm also not going to give a definition,

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,340
let's say media scholars or not

81
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,000
that have given definition on what media is still

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,960
going to do interesting research.

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,360
But please keep in mind that one of my aims here

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,400
is also to, if you decide to adopt a cultural approach,

85
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,480
please be very clear and specify

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,120
and unpacking and operationalize

87
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,640
in your use of terminology,

88
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,160
because it can mean so many different things.

89
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,840
So we have to be quite specific

90
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,200
and hopefully my lessons will help a bit

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,840
to give you, let's say, an insight into the different layers

92
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,200
or different, let's say, lines of research that exist

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,600
and it all used a terminology around culture.

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
So that's what I'm going to try,

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,800
let's say, to bring across two days.

96
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,280
So this is basically structure of today's session.

97
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,200
Let's see how far we get.

98
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,320
It's always unpredictable with slides

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,120
and then move to today and questions of students, et cetera.

100
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,440
But first I want to start with a very,

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,000
let's see, setting the scene,

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,220
focusing on the cultural turn

103
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,960
and the humanities and the social sciences.

104
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,160
I assume most of you will more or less know

105
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,760
what the cultural third in the United

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Social Sciences is, so will not discuss this in depth.

107
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
There are many, many books written on this.

108
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,240
Again, it's a debate, I think that is more or less not finished,

109
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,560
but it has been, let's see, many of the debates we've had

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,360
when discussing the cultural third in the United

111
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,320
Social Sciences have now been internalized in everyday research.

112
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,360
So in that sense, it has become, well, naturalized

113
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
in very literal sense.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,360
That's the first part, very much setting the seat.

115
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,960
Second part, I want to talk to you about post-modernism

116
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,320
and the city.

117
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,760
There are mainly focused on the work of Fredri Jameson,

118
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,600
not because I think that he's the only one

119
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,680
who is written on post-modernism in the city.

120
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,120
He's not even an urban scholar,

121
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,080
because he actually comes from literary studies

122
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,400
and philosophy.

123
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
But his work and his thinking about this

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,240
has been a very influential, especially

125
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,600
because it has been picked up by urban scholars

126
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,640
at a later stage.

127
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,760
Among which, the Los Angeles School of Urbanism,

128
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,440
which is the third section, the third part of today's lecture,

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,400
because they really have worked, you could say,

130
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
with this idea of the postmodern and the city,

131
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,440
and have proposed new ways of studying the city.

132
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,680
As we will see, not everything that they have proposed

133
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,640
was as new as they have claimed,

134
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,520
but still that it has been quite a foundational moment

135
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,960
for the study of the urban, for other studies at large.

136
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,240
To close, now that's closed, and there's a fourth section,

137
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,000
which adopt ups was a continuous partially

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,480
under what the LA School of Urbanism did,

139
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,040
but really sort of broadens it,

140
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,160
broadens it debate and has perhaps been more influential also.

141
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,120
And this is literature that's usually summarized

142
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,440
or determined all this around urban landscapes

143
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,920
or the symbolic economy.

144
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,840
And these are terms that you see popping up,

145
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,240
especially from the mid-1990s, early 2000s onwards,

146
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,160
and that is still a very influential

147
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,600
in our thinking on the city and culture today.

148
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Very last part, I will discuss this today or I'll pick this up tomorrow.

149
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,040
It's what I call "Meaning Half-Way," "Hervan interpology, Cultural Studies," and "The

150
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,600
Spatial Turn," by entry point in discussing New Urban.

151
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
That's in the culture.

152
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,600
This is true as a spatial angiography as a discipline, whatever discipline it might be.

153
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,600
But there was a parallel debate going on.

154
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,360
What we've seen from the late 1980s, 1990s,

155
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,000
all the words is that let's say some of the concerns

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,400
that are in geography or economic geography,

157
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
or human geography at large,

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,400
has had really started influencing other debates

159
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,560
at the same time as human geography started engaging more

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,520
and let's say actively more assertively

161
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
with other disciplines.

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,200
There are many, many disciplines that could be,

163
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,920
that could be, let's say mentioned here,

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,640
but for me, some of the more influential ones

165
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,640
anthropology, urban anthropology and cultural studies.

166
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,640
So where geography is starting engaging more with questions around

167
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,640
and to answer questions.

168
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Traditionally discussed in anthropology or in cultural studies,

169
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,640
cultural studies, anthropology is also starting engaging more with

170
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
the spatial concerns of geography.

171
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,640
So this is something that I will close to this,

172
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
lecture it or open next week lecture.

173
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
And I'm going to first the window.

174
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,640
[inaudible]

175
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Okay.

176
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,640
I'm not sure about you. I'm curious to guys, I'm lazy here. I close the window when I don't

177
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
see it. I'm here in your first time.

178
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,640
I asked one reminder, I have a habit of talking fast.

179
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,640
So, if I talk too fast, just raise your hands.

180
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, this is, I have the very strange habit of talking faster in English than I do in Dutch,

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,520
which would be my mother tongue.

182
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,400
Don't ask me why.

183
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,040
If you ask me German, I'll slow down, but that wouldn't help for, let's say, general

184
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,240
comprehension in this class, I think.

185
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
OK.

186
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,320
First part, cultural turn or cultural turns.

187
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,160
The slides are all uploaded, so in that sense, you don't have to sort of type like

188
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,240
It's really easy to try to focus on the main elements and try to go to flow of the argument

189
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,440
and trying to develop.

190
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,200
Some of you will notice some of you will not.

191
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,560
It really depends a bit I think on your educational backgrounds.

192
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,600
I would assume that those with the social science and especially the humanities background

193
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,240
will be more familiar with this debate than those that say coming from an engineering

194
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,760
background about it much depends a bit on the specificity also which countries you have studied.

195
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,560
So some take-home messages.

196
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
What is the cultural term?

197
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,120
returns, it's part of a wider shift since I would argue late 1970s, at least since this

198
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,000
period that it was phrased as such, in research practices in humanities and social sciences.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,800
So there are various interrelated claims, so that's why I talk about cultural terms

200
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,080
in a way because it's not that easy to identify one single shift in research practices.

201
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,640
One is empirical, and that simply argues, well simply argues, culture is becoming

202
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,560
increasingly important in advanced societies.

203
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,000
Advanced societies being a code word for Western

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,160
Europe and North America basically.

205
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,840
So knowledge-based societies, advanced societies,

206
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,880
post-industrial societies, whatever term you prefer.

207
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,280
So this is the first claim being made as to why there is

208
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,760
and or should be a cultural term.

209
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,160
Culture is simply becoming more important.

210
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
I'll leave open a question what Dan is culture,

211
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,360
but let's just assume that it refers to the arts,

212
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,240
film media, whatever.

213
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,040
So culture becomes more important.

214
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,000
This relates to the second claim, which is theoretical.

215
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,280
We need better theories to grasp better cultural dimensions

216
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,320
of the social.

217
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,600
Referring usually to symbols of fact, meaning-making practices.

218
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,120
The one that doesn't necessarily relate to the second

219
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,560
principle you put out, no change, let's say,

220
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,760
in a beautiful phenomenon, but simply saying, well,

221
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,120
to really understand these holes for now and a better, we need theories that capture this

222
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,920
decultures, let's say dimensions of these phenomena get it.

223
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,280
But obviously when we talk about the cultural turn, often this comes together.

224
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,880
We say, okay, culture is becoming more important.

225
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,440
And very clearly, in order to really understand this better, we also need other theories

226
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,440
because the theories we have don't really capture this quite well.

227
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,520
So that's the second point.

228
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,960
The third point, again, of course, related is methodological.

229
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,440
So if this is the case or also respective of this,

230
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,840
we need new methods to better interpret empirical data

231
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,000
and/or to interpret data differently.

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,280
So either the old data in a different way

233
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,840
or to interpret the better or to interpret data differently.

234
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,040
So it's a time to interpret new data

235
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,520
that we need different methods for this.

236
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,480
A simple example in the current setting

237
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,480
would be if you look at the rise of social media

238
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,080
and let's say data skills, for example,

239
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,000
in that's the last 10 years, is obviously a real method

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,560
that also is an ought to be able to investigate

241
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,240
these phenomena.

242
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,560
So there's a classic.

243
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,160
It's a straightforward example of how new phenomena

244
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,200
has emerged as a society right, and we're not always

245
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,120
able to capture it with the same methods that we had before.

246
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,640
So you might be different skills with that methods.

247
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,080
Again, question mark, not saying this is the case,

248
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
but this is the idea that the argument is put forward.

249
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,440
Because obviously with the existing methods,

250
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,080
you can still do quite a lot,

251
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
or maybe the tweaking ones.

252
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,040
That's important to keep in mind.

253
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,880
So that's the claim,

254
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,200
but also we have to be less successful for classically,

255
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,080
because a lot of this involves less claims

256
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,840
about the cultural term does things better.

257
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,320
But that of course you always have to ask us,

258
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,520
okay, but that will compare to what?

259
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,240
And there's often a kind of simplification

260
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,400
of disciplinary histories,

261
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,200
because then we say let's say within our homography,

262
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,520
it's a, well, we need the cultural term

263
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,200
because we need more qualitative methods before all these old guys just

264
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
qualitative methods.

265
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,240
Yeah?

266
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,440
We're just in data crunching.

267
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,400
This is not what we need.

268
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,960
We need to do new methods.

269
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,960
And there's like, yeah, if you look superficially at that history,

270
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,400
that might be the case.

271
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,760
But if you look more closely, you

272
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,520
will see all kinds of different strands in the, I see, the 100 or more than 100

273
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,480
years of urban studies research that actually come very close to some of the claims

274
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,200
here, made here.

275
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,840
So that's the ethnographic research, for example, took place before.

276
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,320
But it's same, so it really leads to a simplification

277
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,680
of often, that's with disciplinary histories.

278
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,200
And you need to be quiet, and it's quite careful.

279
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,680
The same armaments around, let's say,

280
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
the industrial and the post-industrial.

281
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,640
The post-industrial is not completely new,

282
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,160
no, but attempts to let's say foreground,

283
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,760
different trends that might have existed

284
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,280
at a previous phase also, but in a last, not

285
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,480
in a sense of dominance.

286
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,000
So this is important to keep your mind.

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,760
Yes.

288
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,160
I don't hear anything, sorry.

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Oh yeah, the problem was not speaking loud enough, but I'll see what I see.

297
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Yeah, the building is awful, it was... the building works also, yeah, I see.

Well, welcome.

And it's all so I'm afraid this is not working on it.

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,160
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
That's what you guys are going to do about it.

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,160
All right, I'll try to speak a bit louder and a bit slower.

315
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,160
But there's nothing I can do about the building.

316
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
We should be building for your solid 5-game.

317
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I'll be able to watch the help.

318
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Anyways.

>> So these are some of the main shifts that you should understand as being part

321
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,660
of, let's say, the cultural term, the cultural terms.

322
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,960
Yes? Just to give you some quick examples of, let's say,

323
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,960
of the foundational book stat that might act as a reference of,

324
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,560
let's say, exemplifying the cultural term is getting better.

325
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,860
Yeah.

326
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,500
So exemplifying the cultural turn.

327
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Yes?

328
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,700
I'm wondering how people look on this.

I'm not sure if you don't understand anything.

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,300
I guess.

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,780
precisely because some of his elements,

335
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,340
some of his arguments are, let's say,

336
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,580
really foundational things for much of our urban studies

337
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,900
in this particular strand of research.

338
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,620
But you see it also in political science and sociality,

339
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,500
state formation after the cultural turn,

340
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,460
really looking at, you could say,

341
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,980
meaning making practices, state imaginaries,

342
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,380
some terms that maybe now have become quiet,

343
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,900
let's say, natural, really,

344
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,020
to think about what the state is,

345
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,460
but perhaps from let's say,

346
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
an earlier institutional point of view

347
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,140
were not so much the case.

348
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,300
And as you see, many of these claims are made.

349
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,300
cultural and economy after the cultural term.

350
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Yeah.

351
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
It also does not help.

352
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,300
It can stand in the chair, but it really does not help the acoustics.

353
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,000
So looking at organizations much more from a cultural perspective that is not just about

354
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,440
the organization and let us see the functional matter, but also about again meeting making

355
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:31,300
practices, ways of behaving within organizations, anthropology and history, history and

356
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,940
sociology etc. You could name many many of these books but at that point in time

357
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,140
there was all around late 1980s throughout the 1990s the these kinds of claims

358
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:48,500
were made most forcefully in an academic literature. Now to Fredrik Jameson every

359
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:56,740
year I have to check online if he's not that yet. I don't think he's that

360
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,100
active anymore but you would think he was pretty active until five to ten

361
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,980
years ago, which in itself is quite achievement. He is published in enormous amount of books

362
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:12,420
and articles, is professor or emeritus professor of comparative literature at Duke University,

363
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,620
and hasn't come, I'll just put some buzzwords here, hasn't become very famous for Marxist

364
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:24,100
literary cultural theory, for debates obviously around modernity and postmodernity, and also for

365
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,980
the relation to culture and political economy. So even these buzzwords should already give a

366
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,860
a bit of an explanation, let's see,

367
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,660
ask him how you interpret sculpture,

368
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,420
because he has a strong, you see,

369
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,900
marks it, but in a very, less,

370
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,500
it opens matter, but especially this is important.

371
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,620
So we always look at the relation of culture

372
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,020
to political economy,

373
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,500
which is basically a code for capitalism.

374
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,140
So this is, I would say,

375
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,820
I would say is main concern in his writings

376
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,820
at least on culture and postmodernism.

377
00:18:51,820 --> 00:19:04,460
Now, there's a phrase that has become, well, there's also his article, original published

378
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:12,060
in 1984, which he titled, "Postmodernism as the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism."

379
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
Yes?

380
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,940
So this is really, let's say, a phrase that has become very famous also.

381
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,940
You see it referred to on a regular basis.

382
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,980
Now, there are a number of elements.

383
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,660
I don't know who has read to the article.

384
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,540
I'm not going to ask.

385
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,940
I'm not even going to ask who has actually

386
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,740
managed to finish the article because it's not a simple article.

387
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,620
I'm very well aware of this.

388
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,540
It is worth it.

389
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,540
I mean, I have a drink, sit down, and you

390
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,620
mean you understand it better a bit again.

391
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,340
Who knows?

392
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,420
But it really is--

393
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,900
I'm trying to give you also, let's say,

394
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,620
some foundational original religions,

395
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,780
not just about secular literature of artists

396
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:59,780
writing about other artists. But this is an article related to book that is reference all the time. So it really helps to go back to the original, to get a sense of what is on you.

397
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:12,780
Now I picked to do your homework, I picked some as a key quotes from this article which in a way give a good summary of what this claim is about and which shaped I think some of the urban research later on.

398
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:19,780
First he says course, Martinism is not a style, but it is actually a cultural dominant.

399
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
So it is not just a lifestyle question.

400
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,780
No, it is actually something that has become dominant in our contemporary culture.

401
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,780
Second, I am directly related to aesthetic production today.

402
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,780
And this is of course where let's say it is Marxist-state political economy,

403
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,780
the sympathies show.

404
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,780
A static production today has become integrated into commodity production, generally.

405
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,780
So it's really difficult, the argues, to distinguish aesthetic production of production of the arts.

406
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,780
It's in ball, from commodities.

407
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,780
So it basically becomes one, two sides of the same coin.

408
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,780
That's basically what it is arguing.

409
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,780
I think if you start thinking and verily it's quite easy to come up with a concrete example.

410
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,780
I think that makes a lot of sense.

411
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:07,780
A work of art, let's say painting, is at the same time a static production.

412
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,780
It's about symbolic and reading-making practices.

413
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,780
It's about interpretation, but it also sells a yard market.

414
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,780
It's not due to speculation.

415
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,780
It's both.

416
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,780
Then I started elements.

417
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,780
I'll skip this because it's interesting about there's a very, I say, 1980 sentiment,

418
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,780
where a sort of globalization and Americanization was very much seen as one of the same thing,

419
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,820
mobilization was seen as you can see an extension of earlier history of

420
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,180
Americanization. Yeah. And then it talks about it.

421
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,180
And then again, we're not very important. I say, well, basically, it looks at post

422
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,660
modernism as a third stage of capitalism.

423
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Before it was Annas Bandel was a Marxist scholar actually at this university

424
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,820
one of my years ago, which would then be, yeah, use different terminologies for

425
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,540
it. He refers to post industrial capitalism, he first debate that

426
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:08,140
of the multinational capital and the consumer capitalism. So you can argue this all here is politically

427
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:15,780
economically, politically, economically sized, are postmodernism. So postmodernism accompanies

428
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,720
this phase of capitalism. That also means according to Jameson, it only makes sense to talk

429
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,100
about postmodernism from let's say the mid-1970s onwards. There is no such thing, in this way of

430
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,460
reasoning as postmodernism in the 1920s just doesn't make any sense.

431
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,460
Yeah? Because it's so much tied to a particular phase or a particular stage of capitality.

432
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,980
One reason why this article has become quite famous and it's a bit more difficult to understand

433
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,580
now I think is because it does quite an extensive reading and interpretation of one particular

434
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,980
So we're telling, we're just a bonnetman to hotel in Los Angeles.

435
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,980
So designed by John Portman built in the mid 1970s and one of the largest hotels in LA

436
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,660
and to my knowledge, it still is.

437
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,140
So just some pictures.

438
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,340
This hotel for him, it's a bit hard to imagine now, but if you look, represents, you

439
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,300
could say, the culmination of postmodernism as the late logic, as the last logic of late

440
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
capitalism.

441
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,940
So what does the argue here?

442
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,840
You will see some of these elements return

443
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,100
and later the base without reference to the hotel

444
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,900
or the specificity of his argument.

445
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,300
It ispires to be a total space, a complete world,

446
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,860
and attempt to not be a part of the city.

447
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,980
So it attempts to be a world on its own.

448
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,300
You may not be a part of the city,

449
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,660
so that the reflector class here, which rebels to see,

450
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,780
outside and achieves a peculiar and placeless.

451
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,340
disassociation of the Bonavantura from its neighborhoods.

452
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,140
Just keep this in mind, some of these altitudes,

453
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,300
because they will return later.

454
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,020
The other, the separate from the city.

455
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,580
So it's quite easy to imagine later,

456
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,260
and I'll give some examples also,

457
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,140
if you think of, let's say,

458
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,980
gain the community-style things, right?

459
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,220
Things that are, let's say, within the city,

460
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,580
but cities are highly unequal.

461
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,700
So you have different elements, let's say,

462
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,940
separate, even though they're formally speaking part

463
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,780
of the city.

464
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,900
This is what he's arguing at,

465
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,460
that this is what we see in the Bonavantura Hotel.

466
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,380
And this becomes a bit more difficult to imagine now,

467
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,580
because it really is, I think, an experience of that time.

468
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,100
I think we now so used to these kinds of architectures

469
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,780
and these kinds of buildings.

470
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,940
But according to them, this becomes impossible to navigate.

471
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,580
Of course, not in a high-risk space,

472
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,860
a lot of our lives skip that, is impossible to navigate.

473
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,900
It's just too confusing in many ways.

474
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,060
You can no longer situate yourself as a subject

475
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,220
within this world, but you're just very,

476
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,180
a very fragmented human being.

477
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,460
That was a kind of, let's say,

478
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,700
It's typical, let's say, literary trope of 1980s postmodernism.

479
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,980
I think this has probably become less central to the debate,

480
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,700
most likely because we have so--

481
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,260
we have become so used to behaving like this in the world.

482
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:13,140
Again, I want to discuss these details.

483
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,260
I'll skip the first.

484
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,260
This one might be important to remember here,

485
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,820
because again, this shows up and later discussions,

486
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,420
especially when we think about discussions

487
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,740
around cultural heritage.

488
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,580
Yeah.

489
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,020
His story is a space of history, a random cannibalization

490
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,940
of all the styles of the past.

491
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,540
And his idea that especially postmodern architecture

492
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,140
just used different elements for different eras

493
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,940
and combined as into new building.

494
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,180
So it didn't produce, let's say, formally speaking,

495
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,780
something new, but it was more of a reco-lage

496
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,260
combination of all kinds of existing, let's say, architectural styles.

497
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,300
That's a random categorization of the style of the past.

498
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,120
The past has a reference of drag and re-bracketed

499
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,500
reading with nothing but texts.

500
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,020
So this is also, again, something that pops up

501
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:05,940
in later discussions on what does the culture actually

502
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,420
produce?

503
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,620
And then there's this idea that the post model that-- well,

504
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,940
you actually read the post model phase,

505
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:17,940
but there's no linear trajectory if there ever was a say between history and futures just recycling of the past.

506
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:32,940
Okay, now that's Jamesson does that make a bit more sense than what you read the text?

507
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,940
Yeah

508
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
okay

509
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,220
Now I mentioned Jameson not because I like my old almost dead white men

510
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:51,980
But because he really has been inspirational saying for many let's say researchers that came after from different different perspectives also

511
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,580
Yeah, the Mars engine of school of hermies was born with last cities

512
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,400
Let's say cluster or like cluster of activity that came together from the mid-night

513
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,260
It's all worth and we also refer to Jameson

514
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,780
I know she's built on it anymore.

515
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,540
You can see social scientific urban research type of map.

516
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,020
What does the law of science school of urbanism

517
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,820
argue?

518
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,020
I don't think she's struck this idea

519
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,620
that it is a queer and school, but that it's said to argue.

520
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,100
First of all, following Jameson, literally following Jameson,

521
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,980
it looks at the postmodern condition

522
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,780
as a radically new urban condition.

523
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,420
So this is what they call postmodern urbanism.

524
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,940
Main characteristics, again, be aware

525
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,060
Let's say the simplification of disciplinary histories,

526
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,500
because it does have, especially in this,

527
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,220
let's say foundational texts or texts that

528
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,020
try to say really puts, let's say,

529
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,940
the LA school of early on the map

530
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,140
through a number of key publications.

531
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,700
It did have a tendency to then say,

532
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,500
okay, but everything that came before,

533
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,900
in a way it was, it's old hat.

534
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,740
We don't want that.

535
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,100
We need something new.

536
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,500
So again, very, very much a strong sense

537
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,700
of simplification for some of the main characteristics,

538
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,340
itself, itself, and fun.

539
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,260
Beyond Chikawa School, what we see now is not to

540
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,100
see a centric city, but know it's about urban

541
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,940
fragmentation.

542
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
Yeah.

543
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,660
It understands LA and Southern California as

544
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,900
privileged cases.

545
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,980
So the priority case for the research, but also as a

546
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,380
prototypical case, in the sense that the understood LA and

547
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,100
Southern California as the future of other cities across

548
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,340
the world.

549
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,140
Look at what we see happening in LA and this region.

550
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,820
This is what we will see happening in cities across the world.

551
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,940
Yes, so it's kind of pre-figures as the future urban developments.

552
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,900
Yeah?

553
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,300
It made a lot of attention to restructuring,

554
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,540
which was like, say, the generic word,

555
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,780
focusing mostly on post-fourdism,

556
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,100
flexible accumulation, the redeveloped of firms.

557
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:57,180
So we won't go into this because I think you're all aware by now of, let's see, let's see.

558
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,020
Yeah, post-fourdism, basically.

559
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
Yeah?

560
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,400
And there's a nice quote from my Davis,

561
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,860
"Riner and Liverpool Riner"

562
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,840
belonging more elastic to the same scene in a way

563
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,360
where we talked about the LA School of Urbanists saying,

564
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,000
well, they're basically politically economists

565
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,440
with their spacesuits on.

566
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,960
Quite sure the food you understand, what he means it,

567
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,360
but it sounds really nice as a quote.

568
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,560
So here's your sense, it's politically economy,

569
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,600
but it's a bit off, it's something else, right?

570
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
It's a bit speculative.

571
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Now, I already said it's important again to be aware of simplification of disciplinary

572
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,960
histories and it also applies to the LA school as such.

573
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,800
So it was seen as a coherent school, but it was also soon critiqued by others.

574
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,000
And even by those within working within this domain, or that was said, I say, label that's

575
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,200
been part of the LA School of Urbanism saying, well, actually, there's not one single

576
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,040
claim being made by the LA School of Urbanism.

577
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,240
But actually, there's more diversity within this supposed school.

578
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:15,300
So there is a diversity within Cohe

579
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,720
in itself of all the histories, longer histories, but it really came to gather at this

580
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
point in time.

581
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,920
And I think it still shapes, to some extent, to quite the substantial extent you

582
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,840
current research that we are doing today.

583
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,520
So one important strand to absolute shares become even the most famous one is for political

584
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,600
economy, economic geography, I guess. It really looks at post-war and

585
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,360
complex accumulation, industrial organization, regional development.

586
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,400
So really about the transformation of firms, how firms relate to each other, how they connect,

587
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,400
And what this means for regional development?

588
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
The Latinx and the key artist,

589
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
they have to mention that perhaps how it starts,

590
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
the Christoph

591
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
or certain Michael's store,

592
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,400
but most of you will have heard of these names at least.

593
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,400
I heard there was other lines of work.

594
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
One thing we would be this probably is

595
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
to some extent most relate to the first

596
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
and politically calling your place,

597
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
because if you look at, let's say,

598
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
regional development, the transformation of companies,

599
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
there's also an element there.

600
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
What does this mean, actually,

601
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,720
local place conditions, a place identity,

602
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
but it also has to do with branding elements,

603
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,600
it has to do with, let's say,

604
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,520
local patriotism, or it has to do with local labor markets,

605
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,280
et cetera, yeah?

606
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,520
Yes, that leads to this,

607
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,800
the strand I mean, they're all related obviously.

608
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,480
So what I Jennifer Rolf have been worked

609
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,840
on homelessness, on skilled work, local labor markets,

610
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,440
the classic argument in this literature

611
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,520
is that the transformation of the region,

612
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,440
as a result of less of a transformation

613
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,920
of its political economy,

614
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,320
leads to more polarized labor markets.

615
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,840
So we have, let's say, put in a simplified sense.

616
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,440
We have, let's say, higher earners,

617
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,080
and we have, let's say, very let's see,

618
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,160
if not unskilled, and then it can very low pay

619
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,520
and precariously employ it workers on the bottom.

620
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,160
So it leads to a more polarized labor market.

621
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,360
There's also the argument that has been picked up later

622
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,560
by someone like SARS-CAS-SUSPEN, working on global C's.

623
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,360
So that's important.

624
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
And this wraps us, let's, let's,

625
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,200
that's famous but what's emerging now I think more forward force for the last 10 years

626
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,240
is work around environmental justice you know the transformation of the region has also had

627
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,720
effects on the environment at large planning issues but also ecology issues were narrowly

628
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,320
put and this has already received some attention there yes.

629
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:40,000
He said to say on the space of the kind of march to not that everyone would end up like a

630
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,840
name without any of the things that might have happened to the things.

631
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
I'll give some examples.

632
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,880
I'll take later on.

633
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
But basically it's about overfactantation.

634
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,560
We would have to put it in a bus word to this idea that, I mean, especially me, for

635
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,640
So those that are attending my lecture on the European series,

636
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,460
there's this idea that it's a compact city,

637
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,200
there's a coherent city, it's historically grown,

638
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,160
and then there's a lot of actually,

639
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,240
it's opposed to modern city, it's almost inverse, right?

640
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,040
It's just like a chess board where whatever you could put

641
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,600
for, actually, not a good example,

642
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,840
because you don't say, "If I have tier rules there."

643
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,200
But, but you just like a game board where you could put

644
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,040
wherever you want, and this is how the city develops.

645
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,280
Yeah? So, and this is what, and so this relates

646
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,920
to urban fragmentation, and the other one's broad,

647
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,160
I would say.

648
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,400
There must be two issues where they argue, okay,

649
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,720
this is actually foreshadowing why the Roman develops.

650
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,800
And they're not completely wrong, of course.

651
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,680
I would simply, I would just argue that maybe LA

652
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,520
was not the first and in parallel of these

653
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
to be solved and see many other cities,

654
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
where this was also the case,

655
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,880
especially in the global south.

656
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,240
But this is, I mean, that's only a critique

657
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,720
that has been raised towards the LA school also,

658
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,200
because it's only, only on a later stage,

659
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,960
I think, that it started looking outside

660
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
as North America.

661
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,240
You said it started, it was from American buyers, maybe West and Europe, and totally

662
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,640
later they started spanning.

663
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,920
And then of course somebody's theories no longer hold or somebody claves in any case.

664
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Yeah?

665
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Yeah.

666
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,120
So there's a lot of diversity.

667
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,840
If you look at it at the same time it must be set, purely, to flee between the mid-1980s

668
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:27,620
and the late-1990s, various key publications were published that put LA really on the

669
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:34,820
map of urban studies. So this really helps to think to retrospectively look at this as a kind of

670
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:41,540
current LA school of urbanism. Yeah, ranging from 1986 special issue in society and space which

671
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:47,060
is one of the key journals specifically dedicated to LA to books like the city Los Angeles

672
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:55,300
Urban Theory in the mid-1990s or rethinking LA or studies by Alan Jay Scott on Technopolis. There

673
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,380
many, many of these key books that really appeared

674
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,500
that are key references in the field of our studies

675
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,580
that are still a dealt with or referred to today.

676
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,820
For example, Mike, Mike Davis, and I've

677
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,460
said a lot of academic per se, but his famous book

678
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,380
City of Quartz, which again, is continuously referenced

679
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,500
in many different parts of your studies world and beyond.

680
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:34,620
This one is perhaps already a partial answer to your question because this shows a bit in a three, I would say, how some of these artists looked at at city development.

681
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:42,620
I would say in extreme because this is really an article that tries to codify some of the claims of a rate of more subtle manner, but many other orders.

682
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,620
And by doing so, they also radicalize some of these claims.

683
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:53,620
Not necessarily enough in an helpful manner, I think, but it helps to keep in mind.

684
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,620
So they said they argued that the spatial manifestation,

685
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,620
so maybe all the deer and flusties sort of forgot their names.

686
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:06,620
They argued that the spatial manifestation of postmodern urbanism was a kind of keynote capitalism.

687
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,620
So basically, it's apparently a board game.

688
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,900
I wasn't aware of that, but basically a very fragmented form of an

689
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,260
infrastructure in which the code in urbanization is occurring on a quasi random

690
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,580
field of opportunities. So basically there is no longer this idea that you have a

691
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,980
city center that it emerges outwards or that particular structures related to

692
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,580
planning or set or not it just it's pretty random. And this also of course

693
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,660
also the end of theory because if you make this kind of flame that does not

694
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:42,100
really much you can, you can do anymore. So it's also highly that's simplified. So I would

695
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,980
certainly not encourage you to understand this as the core business of the early school of urbanism.

696
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:54,900
This is almost more a parody of this. Nevertheless, some of the last, the items, literally speaking,

697
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,380
they put on the map of key on capitalism still resonate with us today. Because for example,

698
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,380
We appear at no birth, which you could say there's a lot of reaches still going on unless the ethnic

699
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,380
communities, relation between ethnic groups and, let's say, localities within these neighborhoods.

700
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,380
We have team marks, far side, a lot of commodity commodification of public space.

701
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,380
We have community communities without losing place role.

702
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:24,380
We have street war affairs, obviously there's violence in the city, which is a classic team in our research.

703
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,380
Spectacle, again, which relates to the commodification of space.

704
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,380
Commanding control centers, which is, let's say, a classic team of

705
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,380
like SaaSka SaaS centers, I did at Global Cities,

706
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,380
it's already actually happens when it comes to both political and economic rule.

707
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,380
So, all these different elements do, well, we're identified by them,

708
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,380
and have played the portal role in later research on the city.

709
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:58,380
I guess some examples already here. I don't need to go through this idea.

710
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:09,380
So much my summary of the LA school of realism. I already hinted at the fact that this was not without its critique.

711
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:17,380
Some of this critique was quite legitimate because one of, let's say, my hobby or is this really more against the simplification of disciplinary histories.

712
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,380
There's a lot of academic laziness involved.

713
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,220
You want to make it claim that you do something

714
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,260
rather than an interesting.

715
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,060
And by doing that, you say, but that

716
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,500
what came before was actually not an interesting,

717
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,060
but you actually simplify that history.

718
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,980
So if you're intellectually, I think, very honest,

719
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,260
you have to be very careful with these kinds of strategies.

720
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,220
You have to be much more, as the honest and open

721
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,700
and respectful also of what came before.

722
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,540
And maybe moderate your own claims towards newness.

723
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,100
This is not what the LA school did.

724
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,900
All right, so that's it.

725
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,740
Some more.

726
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:51,980
So critics were also abundance and very early on,

727
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,580
raised, let's say, made, let's say,

728
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,040
problems, had the delicious thing had,

729
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,940
raised, let's say, the claims of newness

730
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,260
put forward by LA's good audience.

731
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,940
One being, what's really new here?

732
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,980
Yeah?

733
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,380
You might claim that this is where

734
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,500
it doesn't receive enough attention,

735
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,740
but actually there's already a lot of existing work

736
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,220
on diversity, restructuring, consumption,

737
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,980
into modification or in every poverty.

738
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,980
And especially every poverty has been foundational to

739
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,860
riding on the urban since the mid-19th century.

740
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,420
So there's vaccines industrialization basically.

741
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,660
So what's really new here?

742
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,900
That's the first legitimate criticism.

743
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,780
Second one is the LA school,

744
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,860
it really sort of reduced Duchikago school

745
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,540
to account of Bergus, concentric zone model.

746
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,660
that everything that was written in the 1930s,

747
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,980
which is post-hocks sometimes labeled as the Chicago School,

748
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,060
was about the consent of the solar model.

749
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,220
It's the idea that there's a central,

750
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,980
a business district and that people move outward,

751
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,780
depending on the history and capital also.

752
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,620
Yeah?

753
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,060
There's much more internal of our work,

754
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,020
or there was much more internal horizon

755
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,580
within the Chicago School,

756
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,900
so it does not justify this kind of simplification.

757
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,380
So many of the things that the LA School is now doing,

758
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,020
actually was already happening in the Chicago school.

759
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
So let's say the American claim,

760
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,700
there's of course also a struggle you could say

761
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,340
within LA, within the US,

762
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,380
but I can say, well, we've had Chicago

763
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,740
now we move to LA.

764
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,540
This is where the action is happening.

765
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,700
And then many other odds were saying,

766
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,340
well, maybe not quite.

767
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,180
Yeah?

768
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,140
So that's the board key mind.

769
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,060
A third one, this graph from me,

770
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,980
the most interesting or the most relevant critique

771
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,380
is there is truly, I think,

772
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:43,660
kind of ethnographic voids in a lot of literature and postmodern urbanism. What do I mean by this?

773
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:50,060
It really relies on a kind of detached reading of the city. This is the most, let's say extreme example.

774
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:55,660
This is how we see the city. I mean after his anything more top-down than this, I mean it's hard to

775
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,460
imagine, right? It really is like okay, let's see here. This is how we see the city. But in a no-ways

776
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:06,860
at no stage, do you see any engagement with what people on the ground actually think about the city

777
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:11,740
the delivered or worked in. So it's a very sort of top-down matrix-oriented

778
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,860
reading of the city, which is labeled as an ethnographic void, which I think

779
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,220
is the most forceful treaty. There's a marginalized agency and

780
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:27,260
interpretation of ordinary people. And there's no postmodernism from below.

781
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,440
You could imagine a kind of, I say, fragmented urbanism and the

782
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,840
the political lodge of combination of elements by people making, making do, making a living

783
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,960
in the city and combining different elements.

784
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,280
But none of that is part of this discussion.

785
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,360
And so it's much more, much too doubt down, too detached reading.

786
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,120
Last critique, and this I have to relate a bit to this idea that LA pre-figures wider

787
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
urban developments.

788
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,840
They're saying, well, LA is actually not that much of a difference.

789
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,720
two levels. First, within LA, existing urban theories before the LA School of Urbanism

790
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:12,000
are still relevant to explain what happens in LA. LA is not a complete free, let's say,

791
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,400
boards with quasi-random, let's say, attempt to stay in place. Now you can use all the theories

792
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,200
around, let's say, agglomeration, for example, in order to understand LA or in this wider region,

793
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,780
So that's one thing.

794
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,580
The other side is that the group of phenomena

795
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:31,140
you see in our area are also visible elsewhere.

796
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,300
And not just as a pre-figuring or something

797
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,180
that comes after the other school,

798
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
urbanists talked about our aid.

799
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,140
No, it actually something that was already before.

800
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,260
Maybe some cities were even earlier.

801
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,540
And this I think is also to some extent

802
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,980
where especially research work in the global science

803
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,660
really connected to, let's say, okay,

804
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,180
that's much happening elsewhere,

805
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:58,180
which is perhaps more interesting also and certainly shows let's say that LA is not that special after all

806
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,180
Okay

807
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,180
Wow

808
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,180
[ Inaudible ]

809
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,180
>> Yeah, that's a screen because otherwise there's a lot of ears.

810
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,180
[ Inaudible ]

811
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:45,180
[ Inaudible ]

812
00:43:45,180 --> 00:44:03,180
I would say to me that I would say certain strands within geography this is what you see. But if you look at much of this literature, especially work by people like Alan Scott who's in the stop us and they are all working in the kind of realist vein.

813
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,740
right, in the sense of it's pretty straightforward and favorable research.

814
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,220
There's a world out there that's going to study it.

815
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,420
Some of the examples you mentioned might have happened, but I would say that was more, let's

816
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,900
say, visible or more central to the data in literary studies.

817
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,820
Maybe cultural studies, to some extent, and less so in geography.

818
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:27,740
So I don't think it was necessarily when it came to the other school of urbanism, necessary

819
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,540
much reflection actually on the epistemologically, the pathological dimension, and it

820
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,100
There was more an observation of new empirical facts

821
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,540
on the ground, which necessitated new theories.

822
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,420
I'll call it them.

823
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,260
So I think it's more on that method.

824
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,260
But obviously, as I said, to very good,

825
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,900
there is no such thing as one culture term.

826
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,620
And also no such thing as one post-modernism.

827
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,980
So I think that's-- and if you look at the way in terms

828
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,420
such as the post-modern has been, I say,

829
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,060
discussed with the different disciplines,

830
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,420
you see quite radical differences between what

831
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,540
actually understood by the postmodern in the first place.

832
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,580
They're interesting books written on this also, but yeah.

833
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,220
Okay. Other questions on these first?

834
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,060
Three, was it two more substantial bars?

835
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:22,900
No. How are we doing time bars?

836
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,100
Yeah, let's give it a few more minutes then we'll see.

837
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,620
Am I talking too fast or is it okay-ish?

838
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,380
I think the fact that it has to be very loud,

839
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,980
it automatically slows me down.

840
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,140
So that helps, no worries.

841
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,980
So I might just start screaming in my lectures

842
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,980
and that I'll slow down my temple.

843
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,480
Yeah.

844
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,480
OK.

845
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,660
So we've got cultural turn.

846
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,780
We've got postmodern, let's say, James Solyan

847
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:02,180
approach it and then sort of vision on the postmodern. This indirectly or directly influence

848
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,420
a lot of LA school urbanism work. Yeah I think it was not just Jamesson but there are many

849
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,900
of many of us similarities there and there's a related strand which now I want to discuss

850
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:16,260
with you which I would call as Erwin Landscape and the Civil War of the economy mostly because

851
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,900
this is the terminology that was I mean the difference strands of research but there's a lot of

852
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:27,220
research around these discounted teams which supposedly refer to actual facts on the ground.

853
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,420
So don't see that something really different from the

854
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,740
Yale School of Urbanists is more let's say developing in parallel.

855
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,020
Perhaps also with different inspirations coming up with a bit more I would argue from

856
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:41,380
Leslie Culture Studies tradition which also emerged in the 1980s.

857
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,260
Yeah but obviously there are interactions also so just

858
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,980
you know as a clear catch category we'll see it.

859
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:54,100
If you look at what I now describe as, let's say, one body of literature because for me it makes sense to describe this as a relative

860
00:46:54,100 --> 00:47:01,380
appearance body of literature. There are a number of key guiding assumptions, arguments shaping this kind of literature.

861
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:09,060
One very similar to Jameson, flexible accumulation, post-fourdism and post-modernism are two sides of the same coin.

862
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:13,700
So this is your Marxist argument, right? So there's a political economy and the culture is

863
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:20,700
the supersetive, the other side of this one of the bleecon. But it's impossible to extract.

864
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:27,700
It just belongs very close to together. And innovation perhaps that this literature introduces,

865
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:36,700
according to the much of this literature, says, well, we receive the rise of postmodernism also hanging together with the rise of a new middle class.

866
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:42,500
And this very much hangs together again with just a rise of post-foughtism, post-industrialism,

867
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:48,340
because it led to new, you could say, work opportunities, new fields of work, new labor markets,

868
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:56,780
which demand that you could say a type of worker, a type of population that was overall highly educated,

869
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,540
that was knowledge oriented, yes, this is the kind of debate around higher education,

870
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,660
knowledge-based capitalism, and this was very much seen as it's highly educated,

871
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,640
that this is what they should understood

872
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,420
to be the rise of a new middle class.

873
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,220
It's not your class of middle class,

874
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,980
which perhaps may say more fixed,

875
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,680
but in this sense, the introduction that was done here,

876
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,460
say, okay, this rise of the new middle class,

877
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,060
is accompanied by a rise or an interest

878
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,580
in new university aesthetic sensibilities,

879
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,820
sensitivity, interest, preferences.

880
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,180
This idea that there's a new kind of a static emerging

881
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,580
with this new group of people.

882
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,900
recently labeled and commodity aesthetics in a way

883
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,880
that because it was highly driven,

884
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,900
a variety related to let's see lifestyle references.

885
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,880
Yeah?

886
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,860
So I'm interested.

887
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,180
I'm interested in a little bit of an example.

888
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:46,900
I'm interested.

889
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,620
I work for, let's say, a--

890
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,140
not, I can't talk about the good example.

891
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,900
I'll try to come up with a better example here.

892
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,140
I'll give you an example in a minute.

893
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,460
Yes, so it does really matter.

894
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:03,220
Look, as the kind of examples I was thinking about,

895
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,780
I'm mostly around, let's say, urban street culture, for example,

896
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:09,740
which is very much related to particular lifestyle

897
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,320
that really lead to how you identify

898
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,420
with particular lifestyle.

899
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,380
These lifestyle are close to connected to the buying

900
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,900
and showing off particular commodities.

901
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,620
Shoes, clothes, hard work that you associate with it,

902
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,580
a bit higher up, et cetera.

903
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,740
So let's say the second part.

904
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:32,020
Third one is that culture was key or is key to urban redevelopment.

905
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,160
This has remained, I think, very influential.

906
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,840
I'm doing work on this still.

907
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,260
But there's also this work that was already,

908
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,880
let's say, put forward at the start

909
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,240
being done in the late 1980s.

910
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,580
We've been done on real estate, on artists,

911
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,640
on recresentations of urban space.

912
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,280
If you think now, we've been done on the impact

913
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,760
of gentrification, on city spaces.

914
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,400
How artists play a role in both, let's say,

915
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,240
boosting gentrification, but also being kicked out

916
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,520
of gentifying areas.

917
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,560
That's a classic argument which I was zucan already made in the early,

918
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,280
no, in the mid-9080s.

919
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,600
So not much has changed to the same in that respect.

920
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,360
And the fourth role I think this is something

921
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,560
that was well to begin with, also picked up

922
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,960
more in the European side of discussion,

923
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,200
and which was not really at all really picked up

924
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,920
by the Yali School of Urbanism, is an important role

925
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,560
of the state, staying investing in cultural landmarks,

926
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,000
but also really developing all kinds of cultural economic

927
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
policies.

928
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,320
So this is more or less, if we have to give, let's say,

929
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,040
a nutshell definition or a listing of key elements,

930
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,440
what the symbolic economy literature is more or less about.

931
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:48,920
Few examples.

932
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,280
One interesting article that we have

933
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,560
in the rest of this urban landscape, early 1990s,

934
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,800
where we argue very much along James Sonian lives,

935
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,760
there's widespread agreements that

936
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:06,580
what emergence of postmodern architecture, culture and philosophy in Western society has

937
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:12,000
proceeded in tandem with the emergence of globalized more flexible forms of capitalist

938
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
enterprise.

939
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,360
For a second part of that quote, postmodernism as the cultural closing of advanced capitalism.

940
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:25,600
So this is basically James of all over the two sides of the same quote.

941
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,840
I registered a question here because I would question if there was really that kind of widespread agreement.

942
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:37,600
Yes, there was widespread agreement on this claim within Marx's political economy.

943
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:43,040
And yes, Marx in political economy became, let's say, especially with geography,

944
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,320
it's pretty not dominant, but central to the debates, I would say, in the 1980s and '99s,

945
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:54,720
especially in the early '90s and '90s. And this is part of that explanatory logic.

946
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,080
I personally am seeing much to agree with and these kinds of claims by acknowledging actually

947
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:06,720
that that message cultural expressions are always that easily the other side of the same coin

948
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,720
of the capitalist politically company. So there's more complexity there that is easily

949
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:19,440
let's say simplified. So this is important to keep in mind unless of course your food

950
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,760
the agreement design, which is possible.

951
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:37,800
So the point about the rise of a new middle class,

952
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,720
again, in the same article, Box Office

953
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,360
is a crime used for some real crime.

954
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,960
You know, it makes a couple of claims, which

955
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,040
is not specific to Nox, but I think

956
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,880
specific or represent of La Cides wider literature.

957
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,480
First he says, well, and this is the shift

958
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,600
to post-industrialism, the emergence of new class

959
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,640
fractions under advanced capitalism.

960
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,520
So we see dominant classes, but actually change over time.

961
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,200
But so the structure is speaking, I say this hierarchy

962
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,240
remains, but different class fractions

963
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,640
might emerge to become dominant.

964
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,800
This is what now under advanced capitalism,

965
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,800
we've seen the words of new class fractions

966
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,560
or a new middle class under advanced capitalism.

967
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,400
That's the economic argument.

968
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,480
The cultural argument would be this was also

969
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,520
a generalical reaction against modernist aesthetics.

970
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,640
I say, the children growing up in the 1960s

971
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,840
rebelled against their modernist parents

972
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,720
and thus started supporting different ways

973
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,320
of behavior, different ways of cultural preferences.

974
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,320
It's not wrong, it's highly simplified,

975
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,920
but it's not wrong, of course.

976
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,920
So that's the perceived, the socio-cultural audience.

977
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
Right?

978
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,360
To this related then, let's say this move away,

979
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,780
this critique of modernism,

980
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,120
really refer more to the kind of lifestyle orientation,

981
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,320
which you can look at positively,

982
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,240
or become a part of everyday life.

983
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,160
This is something that's not just something

984
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,520
that is separate from us.

985
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,400
No, it becomes even more radical.

986
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,600
But you can also look at it more critically,

987
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,560
or just become an out of commodity.

988
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,920
It's just a question of lifestyle,

989
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,720
show your identity, showing off your identity.

990
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,520
So there's a lifestyle orientation.

991
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,240
Self-realization expression, and I

992
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,680
need phrase-phosphology, cultural politics,

993
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,360
true sort of culture, you position yourself

994
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,120
as a citizen in many ways.

995
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:26,440
We're looking at the imagination that already

996
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,040
into the act of described commodity aesthetics,

997
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,320
a kind of niche oriented consumption

998
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,400
with emphasis on taste and aesthetics,

999
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,680
and hence an increased role for design also.

1000
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,440
someone I call a mouse, and they never work,

1001
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,640
they specifically focus on urban design,

1002
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,320
or design sector as a central sector

1003
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,640
in advanced capitalism.

1004
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,880
And we can all understand how this works.

1005
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,720
I mean, I think we're all parts in a way of this group, right?

1006
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,280
So I wear this closing, but not that close.

1007
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,360
We can do it exactly the same,

1008
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,000
but just a slightly different color, right?

1009
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,920
I wear these shoes, but not these shoes,

1010
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,640
or I want wooden floors, or not these kinds of floors,

1011
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:10,440
in my house depending on which phase in your life, your life you are.

1012
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,200
It's pretty niche but still we have very strong opinions about this.

1013
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,880
Don't start talking to me about music.

1014
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,280
They have very strong opinions about music.

1015
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:23,320
But if I look at it from a more distance, obviously I have to admit that it's pretty niche.

1016
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:30,280
Yes, so now I sort of, let's see, I established distinctions between what is good,

1017
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,840
bad or bad or not good.

1018
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,840
Yeah, it's pretty specific.

1019
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,320
So I think this is important,

1020
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,600
this is really about this initial area consumption.

1021
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,880
That has increased, I think, rapidly over the last 30 years.

1022
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,800
I think this is not something that we saw

1023
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,920
to such an extent if you would go to the 1980s,

1024
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,760
for example, early 1980s.

1025
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:57,880
Culture and urban redevelopment, for another strand,

1026
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,320
I would say that's really part of this kind of debate.

1027
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,240
Even earlier in need, I forgot that it's this early.

1028
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,240
One of the earliest probably the first book actually

1029
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,240
by Sharon Zuken, who's called "Loth Living."

1030
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,240
I guess most of you would also know Sharon Zuken

1031
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,240
was done a lot of work in cultural and city.

1032
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,240
"Loth Living" was already published in 1982.

1033
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,240
She was early for her time, so it's not,

1034
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,240
you could say not that typical, but it was really

1035
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,240
a foundational book, I think.

1036
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,240
And it really shapes still many of the dates

1037
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,240
that we're having today around the role of artists,

1038
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,240
in particular in urban settings.

1039
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,280
So around law of living, which was New York oriented, and there are laughs in New York,

1040
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,180
but there are laughs in New York, which of course does not apply to every city, but

1041
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:45,360
structure is sleeping. You can see similar processes, at least in larger cities, I would say.

1042
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:51,020
What did she argue? Okay, we have let's say abandoned laughs, empty laughs, and we see a

1043
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:56,180
re-arpegency of abandoned structures by artists. So early 1980s we're talking about here.

1044
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:01,860
Also New York at the height you could see of its crisis, and let's say at the deep end of this

1045
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,860
developed.

1046
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,340
But it's the first thing.

1047
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,860
A re-occupancy of abandoned structures, where ours.

1048
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,540
This is not followed by a new middle class.

1049
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,640
Yeah, so the artist move in first is still rough for a rowdy, but then the new middle

1050
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,700
class moves in and it gets a bit more, a bit more, a bit more, a sea clean, a bit more

1051
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:23,540
fancy, which she calls a reconquest of the inner city, needing to kind of laugh lifestyle.

1052
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:30,060
There are people living in, let's say, dwellings that do not represent your class fill

1053
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:34,380
that point in time, sub-berber, let's say one family household.

1054
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,600
So you have to come up with a new architectural style,

1055
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,580
a new way of imagining how to live in these laws.

1056
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,460
Besides an also become an increasing trade of conflict

1057
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,140
between competing uses.

1058
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,700
Those between alt and havences, if the inhabitants,

1059
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,540
if they were still there, artists, and a new real-world class.

1060
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,700
Where artists use laws also as a production infrastructure

1061
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,060
to produce art.

1062
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,100
you will have last by and large used these laws

1063
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,820
as residential infrastructure.

1064
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,380
Yeah, we worked somewhere else.

1065
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,780
And then culture is also very early on,

1066
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,220
especially even from the early nights,

1067
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,700
the age onwards in New York was used to develop

1068
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,940
and profit from an emergent real estate market.

1069
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,980
So real estate intermediaries, very early on,

1070
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,780
realized that our desardest movie in,

1071
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,860
selling this area becomes interesting,

1072
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,340
becomes visible at the very least.

1073
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,140
And thus we can actually use this.

1074
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,060
We can explore this.

1075
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,580
This is something we can build on.

1076
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,580
And we can start identifying this.

1077
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:36,060
We can start selling this for a project.

1078
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,740
Now this was early '98.

1079
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,780
And if I tell you with this story, it's pretty clear,

1080
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,900
I would think, being all being over scholars,

1081
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,860
that this resonates, let's put it at those terms,

1082
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,420
resonates with discussions you see on an everyday level

1083
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,940
and most of the cities that you are familiar with.

1084
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:55,420
This idea that, oh, that's a gentifying area,

1085
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:00,140
this like a proto defvenation of gentrification or cultural gentrification.

1086
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:07,660
So I think if I think of an area such as anyone Brussels such as Saint-Gio to some extent this

1087
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:14,060
logic is followed. I mean I'm not familiar with too many cities but I see several things happening

1088
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:19,660
in Berlin or so on and still see happenings and saw happening and in many other cities where this

1089
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,860
is the case, quite obviously.

1090
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,580
For this, has been a major strand of research

1091
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,700
for quite a long time already.

1092
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,140
And it has been refined, et cetera,

1093
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,380
but it still shapes the discussion.

1094
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:43,300
So ultimately, of course, there's also, again,

1095
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,140
this has also received research adventure.

1096
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,340
But also, the main set art is

1097
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,700
have become both drivers and victims of urban development.

1098
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:54,500
And similarly, in that time, ours are in development,

1099
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,580
which shows our artists were, well, really,

1100
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:01,740
the early, let's say, the movers to move into a certain area

1101
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,340
and start developing the area,

1102
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,180
to build into development, to love development,

1103
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,740
other types of building development.

1104
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:11,340
But then, when the area, the neighborhood

1105
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,820
had reached a certain stage of development

1106
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,020
and real estate prices, ours then, again,

1107
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,220
were in a sense moved out because they could no longer afford to live there.

1108
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:24,660
Except those perhaps that were smart enough to buy at an early stage, but this was rarely

1109
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,660
the case.

1110
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,660
But then the end.

1111
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,060
So they were both drivers and victims of urban change.

1112
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:33,340
And this again hasn't changed that much over the last 30 years.

1113
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:39,100
Except that perhaps this phenomenon has globalized and it has become a much more strategic

1114
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,100
government.

1115
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,740
Well, they much more than see forceful government strategy.

1116
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:48,740
So this is in a way mainstream urban development by now.

1117
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,660
OK.

1118
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:51,820
Looking at the time, let's take a quick break,

1119
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,580
and then I'll continue with the second part,

1120

>> Yeah, okay. Let's go.

1228
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:39,580
So we're still in the symbolic economy part.

1229
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,680
And I'm discussing different strands, or what I mean.

1230
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,320
This is less identified by me.

1231
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,960
So what I consider to be a relatively clear

1232
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,200
and body literature will then

1233
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,560
this body of literature, there are a number

1234
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,120
of different strands of, let's say, research attention.

1235
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,920
So before I just finished the part on

1236
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,440
let's see cultural redevelopment.

1237
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,360
Now in last part within that section,

1238
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,000
I would argue really focuses on read presentation

1239
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,120
of her misplaced.

1240
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,560
Now please understand every strand that I discuss,

1241
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,200
I can only do so much in a two hour lecture,

1242
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,120
in the mind of the Greeks.

1243
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,080
But please understand every strand as potential,

1244
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,720
let's say, lives of investigation for yourself.

1245
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,920
Or a favor for the master thesis, whatever, right?

1246
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,000
Just trying to let's say, hopefully,

1247
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,440
give some inspiration as to what possible teams,

1248
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,560
possible topics are that you might want to engage with

1249
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,600
in more detail.

1250
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,720
So this is also for me a bit,

1251
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,560
what I see as my role in,

1252
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,960
especially for those here and their first semester

1253
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,660
on the first year master, what I see as my role.

1254
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,560
Just giving a few, let's say, foreigners,

1255
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,160
there's a few ideas about what could potentially

1256
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,060
be interesting to do more research about.

1257
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,060
Yeah?

1258
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,260
So one element here is re-placitation of urban space.

1259
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:56,160
This is probably a relatively straight forward exercise

1260
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,760
where a lot of attention recently,

1261
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,060
especially outside of urban studies, in marketing,

1262
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,860
it's true to anything you're boring,

1263
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,660
but still there's not a discussion,

1264
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,760
but we should investigate the role of media

1265
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:13,880
marketing and putting cities on the map. I should say, no one. There's a lot of

1266
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,760
boring research being done in this field. There's also some interesting research

1267
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,760
being done in this field. But some of this is very instrumental. So there's this

1268
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,760
research that focuses on urban images, what kind of interests do we have in mind

1269
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,920
when we think about cities, how it can lead to change geosemages, or some contested

1270
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:35,720
images. And we all will have, let's say, city images in our mind, when we're not

1271
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:39,880
I've got to do the quiz now, but they would ask you to sort of, I would mention a city,

1272
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:45,200
I would ask you to mention the first English that pops up in your hat.

1273
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:50,000
Then it's quite clear there will be a large element of consensus, I think, within the audience.

1274
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,720
Paris, Eiffel Tower, I mean something like that, right?

1275
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,640
So the couple of cliches.

1276
01:14:55,640 --> 01:15:00,280
This has become increasingly important in debates also around urban tourism.

1277
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:05,000
Especially in your experiences, I've always been key sites for tourism.

1278
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yes, so there's the grand tour, there's the upper middle classes,

1279
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,000
aristocrats, European elites who have a travel to and around

1280
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,600
two different European cities.

1281
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,000
But as we come, let's say,

1282
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Massified over the last 60, 70 years from the after world for two.

1283
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And it was really that same to let it's own development around her maturity.

1284
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And, of course, that's it, the whole discussion about her energy

1285
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,400
will also fit in here.

1286
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,400
Yeah?

1287
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,200
This has increased.

1288
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,600
It also been picked up where you could say it was, to some

1289
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,600
extent, firm driven.

1290
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,200
That's the entrepreneur driven.

1291
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,000
This has increased.

1292
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,800
It's been picked up by most local and national states as

1293
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,000
important development strategies for the local national regard,

1294
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,400
which has really really with the focus on tourism as the

1295
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,800
important driver for the economy.

1296
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,800
It's a highly volatile economy, of course.

1297
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,800
This is something we now see with COVID to, well,

1298
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,200
it's a very clear sense.

1299
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,320
It's only everything falls flat,

1300
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,720
and that's for locally cars that rely heavily on tourism,

1301
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,120
that's obviously is quite a disaster.

1302
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,480
You can now be speaking of course,

1303
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,000
socially speaking that's another discussion.

1304
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,360
That is a nice book also, that's why it's a national here,

1305
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,360
not when it's trusted by many people,

1306
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,680
but they are greenback, how, you're outside.

1307
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,680
Branding to the world, how a Sydney crisis

1308
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:32,080
sold to the world, which traces a bit, let's say, the branding of the York from the 1980s

1309
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:40,240
onwards, our city at the bottom ends being confronted with out migration. I can try to reinvent

1310
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:46,320
itself through its images in order to become, let's say, more attractive again. Open question,

1311
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:51,040
of course, if the branding has played the most important role in the city become more attractive,

1312
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:55,040
what's already has played a role in this.

1313
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:01,040
Okay. Last part in the role of the States, very briefly.

1314
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,080
Again, this is the debate that has been picked up,

1315
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,040
both in our mistakes as well as our side of our mistakes

1316
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,040
for a culture perspective, especially in those

1317
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,040
who are specifically on cultural policies,

1318
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:15,040
which is a dedicated field of research on its own.

1319
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:19,040
Which I would say you see a couple of things.

1320
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,160
We see strategies aimed at really developing culture industries.

1321
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,440
I have myself done research on this older

1322
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,360
data around culture industries, which is very much about

1323
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,360
local economic development.

1324
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,400
It's a data that you actually attract artists, culture

1325
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:37,360
workers, to your city, in order to develop economic economies.

1326
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,280
Much research attention has gone into this since the 1990s,

1327
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,920
but especially 2000s.

1328
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,880
There's also research around large scale events,

1329
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,800
world fairs, art exhibitions.

1330
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,040
Again, this hasn't much, much longer history.

1331
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,760
They transcend also, are we studies as a discipline?

1332
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,760
Because if you look at, let's see,

1333
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,200
a discipline such as art history

1334
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,480
that has done excellent work on, let's say,

1335
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,520
art exhibitions and world fairs

1336
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,560
from the mid-19th century onwards.

1337
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,560
Yeah, so the hour always, let's see,

1338
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:11,520
depends to attract the global or is European audience

1339
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,440
to your city.

1340
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,080
But again, this has become increasingly

1341
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:20,600
kind of economic strategy. So you want to attract your Olympic games, you want to attract

1342
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:26,600
a biennial or you want to add a biennial etc. There's also been increased in critique because

1343
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:33,160
often there's a lot of investment going into this but what actually delivers tends then

1344
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:38,200
turns out to be quite limited. And more broadly I think there's literature again from the 1980s

1345
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,160
onwards, why should we do more for the zuchen on the arts and the urban growth machine as it was

1346
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,760
called to the 1980s, certainly, which really focuses on us

1347
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:52,200
seeing art networks, the elite networks, and arts institutions

1348
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:57,040
as local attractors for inward investment and urban development.

1349
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,920
So there's a classic example, if you look at the--

1350
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,320
in the position of the Google Cloud Museum in Google Cloud,

1351
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,680
that's an always-maintured case when it comes to a new place

1352
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,200
museum in the relatively rundown city.

1353
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:14,920
simplifying here and this would really boost the local economy.

1354
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,280
And to some extent it did.

1355
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,480
Again, if many issues attached to it,

1356
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,120
what is not complete before us.

1357
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,160
So there, this is work that has received a lot of attention also.

1358
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:29,920
Here, one more recent example.

1359
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,280
Not sure if the city needed, you could say this.

1360
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,000
It was certainly not around rundown city in a sense.

1361
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,200
Does anyone notice an example?

1362
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:46,700
So it's M+ museum in Hong Kong actually, which actually was just open I think two, one

1363
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:54,200
or two weeks ago, two weeks ago designed by Star Architects, Herzog in the Miron, and a

1364
01:19:54,200 --> 01:20:01,120
typical, you could see an example of a city that is both aimed at attracting and perhaps

1365
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:06,920
improving to the cultural image of Hong Kong, but attracting, let's say tourism to the city,

1366
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:13,320
But also as a kind of advertisement for the C.

1367
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,520
And there's some extent in the very little sense,

1368
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,120
because the main real insight is one big LCD screen

1369
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,920
at the same time next to being a museum.

1370
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,840
So you could actually sort of literally see how this is

1371
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,520
a kind of commodity style, right?

1372
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:31,520
So a very, very literal manner.

1373
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,720
But also for example, big commercial art experience,

1374
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,440
So this is our Basel, who developed, let's say,

1375
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,960
well, which is now staging.

1376
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,560
I'm not quite sure what the current state is,

1377
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,000
because also, COVID really messed up a lot.

1378
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,520
But what it was is staging annual art fairs,

1379
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,800
and Basel, and Miami, and Hong Kong.

1380
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,560
Not only did these events attract

1381
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,640
well-teated visitors by and large.

1382
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,360
Yeah, they also spent there in these cities.

1383
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,720
So again, it becomes a kind of local development machine.

1384
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,560
Yeah?

1385
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,160
Well, recently our Basel also started a so-called

1386
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,040
our Basel series initiative,

1387
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,360
where we try to have events in different cities,

1388
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,280
which in this case, when as I was,

1389
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,040
it's one example, which supposedly should benefit our Basel,

1390
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,880
because it can globalize more,

1391
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,520
but also other things across the world

1392
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,400
would be not at an annual artist,

1393
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,160
and suppose we benefit from us

1394
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,640
in the name of the reputation of our Basel.

1395
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,520
And we see these kinds of initiatives emerging

1396
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,120
quite forcefully over the last,

1397
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,040
especially over the last 10, 15 years.

1398
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,680
Okay.

1399
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:36,560
Last section for today, and I'm actually doing quite well

1400
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,400
at the time.

1401
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,480
So I also won't discuss this,

1402
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,000
unless not every bullet point on the slide.

1403
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,140
But just as a kind of wrapping up,

1404
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:52,560
to reposition, let's say my debate,

1405
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,680
which was let's see mostly oriented within urban geography,

1406
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,880
but to reposition again within the broader debate

1407
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:09,880
on the spatial term. As much of what I discussed, what I showed you, graph of concern, or do you go to graph of concerns? But the spatial term more broadly frames that count of the data.

1408
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:18,880
So, just to wrap up, in the late 2020 century, urban geography was heavily influenced by the cultural term. This I discussed.

1409
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,720
So I related the base in postmodernism and globalization.

1410
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:27,520
This has had to, in effect, let's say the epistemological and mythological effect was that

1411
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:33,720
there was an increased interest in ethnography, everyday life, imaginaries, re-presentations

1412
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,720
or in short culture.

1413
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:42,720
So this really what I think has shaped much of urban geography over the last 30 years.

1414
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,520
Across the social sciences, this is how I opened my lecture of the day.

1415
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:52,440
This cultural turn intertwined with increased interest in spatial configurations.

1416
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:58,080
So that's the urban geography has already been introduced to cultural questions, to cultural

1417
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,440
disciplines, which I would say is cultural studies and anthropology.

1418
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,480
We became more interested in spatial questions.

1419
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,080
So there were a number of reasons for this.

1420
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,640
One is, I addressed this in some other lectures.

1421
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:17,900
there's a kind of really post 1989 obsession with globalization. On one level and

1422
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:23,940
superficial level globalization is the end of spatial questions because

1423
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:28,460
everything is global. But it actually intensified this concern with spatial

1424
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:33,480
questions because it soon became clear of course that it was a process that

1425
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,620
actually had spatial effects and it was spatial process. It was a stretching of

1426
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:43,140
of social relations taking place, which could be and needed to be understood in a spatial

1427
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:44,140
manner.

1428
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:49,980
Connecting A to B as a spatial effect and it leads to a different spatial configuration.

1429
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:54,180
I have social sciences humanities, sorry.

1430
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,180
Yeah.

1431
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,780
I don't want to be able to fit everything on an already two crowded slide.

1432
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:04,500
I had to sort of, yeah, so across the social sciences and humanities.

1433
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,380
So the creative interest in spatial questions.

1434
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:07,380
in spatial questions.

1435
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,020
So this of course, where the geography starts becoming

1436
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:13,060
an inspirational discipline for other disciplines.

1437
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:17,940
This is exactly what happens in the '99s especially.

1438
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,100
Hence, the increase in interaction

1439
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,660
with your own job, your methodology, and cultural studies,

1440
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:23,340
which are already hinted at.

1441
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:29,140
I'm only going to go quickly through this,

1442
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:33,900
but the slides are slightly more detailed

1443
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:37,660
because I added these slides because not, let's say,

1444
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:41,500
the elements I discussed in the previous slides,

1445
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,620
the previous one hour and 20 minutes or so,

1446
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:48,540
cover I would say most of what is relevance,

1447
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:51,460
concerning the culture and urban geography

1448
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,020
over the last 30, 40 years,

1449
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,740
which has already quite a challenge to fit that

1450
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:58,260
into a two hour lecture, but it really misses also some elements.

1451
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,940
So, I mean, I proposed, let's say,

1452
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,500
quite a day in a way, a linear trajectory

1453
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,800
of how previous discussions,

1454
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:04,980
influence current discussions,

1455
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,620
and that had an effect on this.

1456
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:08,740
But in parallel, of course, there were also discussions.

1457
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,280
And I just want to briefly end at it,

1458
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,180
because there's again,

1459
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:14,420
these are almost, and then we've got more or less important,

1460
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:16,940
but we can't really necessarily trace back

1461
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,640
to some of the elements to, let's say,

1462
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,820
Frannie Jameson, for example.

1463
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:24,420
So there are two core teams, perhaps,

1464
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,100
that have also really shaped

1465
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:30,780
into disciplinary urban studies over the last couple of years,

1466
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:34,140
and that we have emerged more forcefully

1467
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:36,140
from the disciplines outside of geography.

1468
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:39,580
But it's definitely that informing urban studies

1469
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:43,140
at large, for me, is a very interdisciplinary discipline

1470
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:46,940
optimistic to elements.

1471
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:50,020
One, informality, second, everyday life.

1472
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:53,060
Informality for those that have studied ethnography

1473
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:55,620
and anthropology, they will become,

1474
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,900
well, it will be quite familiar with this term.

1475
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,720
This, in the story, I give some examples there.

1476
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,980
The religion that looks specifically on

1477
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,340
coming from also the development perspective,

1478
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:07,580
or the developmental lists,

1479
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,380
perspectives to some extent,

1480
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:11,700
focusing on labor markets, precarious work,

1481
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:14,300
migration, legality, political governance

1482
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,860
and conversation, our unpacked this in a minute.

1483
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:20,060
Everyday life, partially overlapping,

1484
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:23,380
but partially coming from where this tends to come,

1485
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:25,900
we're simplifying it from anthropology,

1486
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:30,540
and our company life tends to come from what I would say is cultural studies as a discipline

1487
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:36,700
of the immersion in 1980s, focused very much on agency, community community, women, resistance,

1488
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:43,900
often on local level, often lifestyle, really consumption, identity, media and representation.

1489
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:48,620
So when precisely these terms, those are the newspapers, political rights, there's this

1490
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:53,540
obsession with some of these terms as that they want to critique and then emerge and think

1491
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:57,860
more closely from cultural studies. Obviously, the clinics have never read cultural studies,

1492
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,540
but that's another discussion.

1493
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:07,540
Let me see. Now, in formality, I'm actually going to see it because this has become a

1494
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:12,580
special last 10 years of studies. There's so much research taking place now on informality

1495
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:17,500
and the urban. But it's important to keep in mind that this was already a classic team

1496
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:22,300
within urban anthropology and development economics, especially from the early 1970s

1497
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:27,100
on this. An article always references the one by Keith Hart in formal income opportunities

1498
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:32,660
in urban employment in Ghana and in the title itself already makes pretty clear what's

1499
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:37,220
well, where he stands and what the topic is, right? It is really about local labour markets.

1500
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:41,820
It's about local economic development, yeah? But what did Keith Hart and many others

1501
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:46,740
with an argue? There is a lot of, and I think it's something that maybe she was an ominous

1502
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:51,860
lecture for European citizen or urbanising world also picked up on what is registered to

1503
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:57,100
be part of the economy is only part of what is what you should consider as economic

1504
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,100
activities.

1505
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:03,980
So we have formal economic practices, businesses that pay taxes and that are registered

1506
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:09,620
as businesses, but there's a lot of employment beyond these formal economic practices.

1507
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:16,140
So beyond governments, beyond firms, beyond factories, beyond large-scale economies.

1508
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:19,980
So this is where the distinction between informal and formal comes from.

1509
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:23,980
So this is important to keep in mind.

1510
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:28,980
This, of course, gets slippery because in some literature, this and this comes together.

1511
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:33,980
And we say, well, I actually did formalist illegitimate and informal is the legitimate, but

1512
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,980
that is only partial, but partial, true.

1513
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,980
I mean, we can have discussion about what's legitimate.

1514
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:43,980
But that's, for example, we'll all agree that someone taking care at home of their children

1515
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:45,980
that are constantly exploring, but we do.

1516
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:49,620
I think that both the All-Solary that is not illegitimate to the

1517
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:51,700
contemporary, well, far from it, right?

1518
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:57,100
So where has dropped trafficking is probably informal

1519
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:00,500
because it's not registered as such, but many would also

1520
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,860
consider legitimate.

1521
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:04,300
Again, we can have a discussion on this if that makes sense

1522
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:06,940
that distinction.

1523
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:08,460
But this is how it comes to the emerge.

1524
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,820
And this is interesting because there's one of, not few

1525
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:13,700
concepts, but one of the key concepts that have really

1526
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:18,180
traveled from the global south to the global north. So this is where it worked that

1527
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:23,860
he emerged most forcefully in the research on the global south. And this is what it was

1528
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:28,340
really sort of the travel that says to the global north. That doesn't happen too often

1529
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:33,780
you could say. So I mean in terms such as postmodern urbanism in a way is the opposite

1530
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:40,780
example.

1531
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:54,780
Now an urban anthropology, if you look at informality, it needs a lot of research on opportunities,

1532
01:29:54,780 --> 01:30:00,780
but also precarious precarity created by unregulated economic activities.

1533
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:03,500
So there's strong interest in gender dimensions.

1534
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:07,380
So people are working on markets, working at home.

1535
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,740
So this is really about, let's see,

1536
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:12,340
what the bread and butter of a lot of urban anthropology,

1537
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,060
as well as transnational dimensions.

1538
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:15,340
Particularly this is the mention of the thing

1539
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,220
that has been picked up most clearly

1540
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:20,740
in the more cultural work in early studies.

1541
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,500
So for example, many street founders

1542
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,580
also do transnational migrants here

1543
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:26,980
in a picture of La Amalana and Barcelona.

1544
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,340
So illegal migrants are doing working

1545
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:33,640
on the city, and it raises questions of economic survival,

1546
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:37,020
most obviously, but also questions of the governance

1547
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:41,100
of the political identity of these actors

1548
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:44,020
or the cultural identity of these actors.

1549
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:45,580
And with an enormous study, there's

1550
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,580
a big amount of research, which has really

1551
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:51,300
led to a boom, I think, of research and informal,

1552
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:52,860
and on formal urbanism.

1553
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,940
You know, I pick up some of these elements in my lecture

1554
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,700
next week.

1555
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:58,740
Now, that's very brief.

1556
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:03,780
I mean, I could have two, three lectures for sure on informality as a concept, as a practice,

1557
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:06,420
and how it's picked up in different strands of research.

1558
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:10,420
Just as a kind of stepping stone, please understand this as a stepping stone to, let's say,

1559
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:14,340
the more contemporary research that I will discuss next week.

1560
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:19,220
The second strand of research, which has been much part of us in a forced modern urbanism

1561
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:24,340
drag, this is what we call in drag, is the literature on everyday life.

1562
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:29,380
I myself have been partially trained in cultural studies and everyday life was a concept

1563
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:32,580
that popped up that it was regularly used all the time.

1564
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:41,000
From the late 1980s, 1990s onwards, it was really used as a key topic.

1565
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,100
What does the term basically entail in most cases?

1566
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,500
Because ultimately, it's also not more than a bus work.

1567
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,700
There's a lot of theory behind it.

1568
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:53,540
But ultimately, it entails a key concern with lift experiences of people and the meanings

1569
01:31:53,540 --> 01:32:01,620
constructed by subjects in their own world. So classic cultural concerns, if you wish.

1570
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:08,020
So most of this literature and cultural studies on everyday life tends to also position

1571
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:12,780
people as active agents, rather than as passive consumers or passive recipients of political

1572
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:18,940
power. So this automatically leads to this kind of debate on strategies for tactics and

1573
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:21,380
So the resistance people can have on the ground

1574
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:24,700
in relation to the structures they are confronted with.

1575
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:26,500
Well, they are confronted with.

1576
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:30,700
I'll skip this part because there's also another part

1577
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:33,740
in anthropology which also addresses it.

1578
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:38,980
And this also makes, I think, the everyday

1579
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:40,980
it truly transdisciplinary concept.

1580
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:43,020
I mean, again, there are not too many concepts

1581
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,020
that are truly transdisciplinary.

1582
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:47,260
I try to understand urban studies as a discipline

1583
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,860
that is much broader than specific disciplinary debates

1584
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:53,140
because it's just fairly boring to stick to one discipline.

1585
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:56,340
But the everyday has really emerged from the 97,

1586
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:59,140
97 as it truly translates to an early concept.

1587
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,300
So again, similar to the postmodern,

1588
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:04,340
I think a question that was raised at the back,

1589
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:06,620
there is no such thing as one postmodern.

1590
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:08,260
If you look at different disciplines

1591
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:10,060
to really be at the standard postmodern,

1592
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,300
it's quite substantially different

1593
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,020
and sometimes even contradictory,

1594
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:16,380
the same applies to the everyday.

1595
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,380
when one discipline or one order says about D every day,

1596
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:21,880
might not overlap to a grade degree

1597
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,880
with one another or on the right spot the every day.

1598
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,580
So you really have to look at disciplinary specifics

1599
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:28,100
in order to understand this.

1600
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:33,100
Nevertheless, it has emerged as a term, as a concept

1601
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,440
that really connects cultural theory

1602
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,220
with philosophy, with Marxism,

1603
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:39,500
and Alfred P. P. P. P. with post-structuralism,

1604
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,100
with sociology and with aesthetics.

1605
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:45,780
So the many interesting, let's see, Andrew Porns also P. P. P.

1606
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:49,780
So, for instance, specifically, next to the unavoidable hornet in the favor,

1607
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:54,780
the every day, who sees the every day as a side of utopian possibility,

1608
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:59,780
but also colonize but a commodity form, so that's commodity aesthetics once again.

1609
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:04,780
I can only urge you, and of course, honker the favor is great, we all like him, etc.

1610
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:08,780
But there's also a lot of interesting work that has been done by other artists, which is perhaps,

1611
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:13,780
at least as relevant, let's put it in those terms, than honker the favor.

1612
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:16,340
Please, no, no, no, no more papers on the right to the city.

1613
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:17,340
I've read enough of those.

1614
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:20,180
That's, yeah.

1615
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:22,420
For example, Stuart Hall and Tony Jackson,

1616
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:24,420
classic British cultural studies.

1617
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:27,420
Some of you might be familiar with this over there work.

1618
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:30,540
Especially Stuart Hall, I mean, if not, the readers work,

1619
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:33,540
because it's pretty, well, it's very, very good.

1620
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:35,060
For really looked at, looked at,

1621
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:37,180
as he sub-fulchers, and every day

1622
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,100
as a symbolic opposition to a dominant order,

1623
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:42,260
I'm just mentioning some key words that talk up here,

1624
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:46,420
that we determine knowledge and the thing which has become internalized in much

1625
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:52,140
of our thinking about urban cultures, resistant style, social practices, sub-told use

1626
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:55,600
code, urban use identity.

1627
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,600
Yeah?

1628
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,580
Terminality that was not used for the first time by Stuart Halden others, but they really

1629
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:02,580
theorized it.

1630
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,780
And they really did something new.

1631
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:05,780
Yeah?

1632
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:09,620
One caveat of course is especially early cultural studies work.

1633
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:13,700
It was highly blind to gender, gender dynamics.

1634
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:16,860
Yeah, this was, I mean, the picture shows it was,

1635
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:20,300
youth subculture was very much around male youth subculture.

1636
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,020
Yeah?

1637
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:23,660
This is Washington addressed by a lot of such

1638
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:25,740
as ancient I met Robbie.

1639
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:29,140
It was actually my first huge supervisor

1640
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,460
and feminist cultural studies.

1641
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:33,700
But certainly, let's see, you kind of

1642
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:35,940
underlying trend in the early culture studies tradition

1643
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:38,460
that it was pretty blind to gender issues.

1644
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:42,620
or supporting intersectional other intersection issues.

1645
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:44,580
From quite a different angle, but again,

1646
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:46,980
and they are an amazing book, very thin book.

1647
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:49,420
So he's the reader that's very well written.

1648
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:53,260
The practice of everyday life by Michel de Sertou.

1649
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,580
I'm at the business translation, obviously.

1650
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:58,580
I think the French is maybe 10 years old

1651
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:01,140
and more of any of the original.

1652
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:04,980
More poetic, but maybe folks in practice, tactics,

1653
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,900
versus strategies.

1654
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:09,820
So the idea being that strategies are top down

1655
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:13,220
and people on the street, they sort of engage with this

1656
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:17,060
and develop tactics in order to avoid state strategies

1657
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,740
with mostly government strategies.

1658
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:24,740
So tactics are situated, tactics as resisting,

1659
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:27,580
let's say broader structures.

1660
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:29,540
This again has very much shapes.

1661
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:30,940
I'm not saying that everything is good about it

1662
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:32,140
because it's too dichotomous,

1663
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:35,420
but it's a very influential book

1664
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:38,260
that has reshaped much of the data at home.

1665
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,500
Could next we will talk a bit more about, let's say,

1666
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,540
from the everyday to cultural work and activism,

1667
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:47,820
bit more about DIY organism, where some of the DIY

1668
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:49,620
urbanism literature, for example,

1669
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,740
in listening or explicit and first to the cutout

1670
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:54,500
of stuff that is subtorted already in 1980s.

1671
01:36:54,500 --> 01:37:02,380
Okay, just to conclude, as I mentioned,

1672
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:09,940
The cultural term is to be understood as part of a wider shift in analytical sensibilities

1673
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:11,900
in the social sciences.

1674
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:17,980
I mean at the very beginning I said okay, the empirical theoretical and the methodological,

1675
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:24,900
these are three takes on how at that point we started looking differently at the

1676
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:25,900
world.

1677
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:26,900
Yeah?

1678
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:34,460
So, urban geography itself as one strand of debate within this broader cultural term was

1679
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:37,200
And here's how you heavily influence by Marxist

1680
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,820
or at least political economic interpretation

1681
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,700
of postmodernism as the cultural expression

1682
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:44,000
of late capitalism.

1683
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,520
Yeah?

1684
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,980
You can also phrase differently.

1685
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:51,820
There's very little subtle nuance, cultural readings

1686
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:55,180
of, let's say, symbolic objects such as the arts

1687
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,220
in urban geography.

1688
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,220
For that, mostly you have to move outside of geography

1689
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,920
because it does not have this history

1690
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:05,640
of taking suddenly about, let's say, cultural expressions.

1691
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,600
Which doesn't mean it's not good, but it's limited

1692
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,000
in that respect.

1693
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,840
The work in symbolic economy, and the labels on this,

1694
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,080
but it has shifted attention a bit more

1695
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,400
to questions of re-presentation,

1696
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,960
to urban lifestyles and culture production.

1697
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,480
So the postmodern urbanism school

1698
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:24,880
was, wasn't interested that much in artists

1699
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,080
producing actual pieces of work in an actual art.

1700
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,920
It was most interested in consumption.

1701
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,280
Yes, come on, there's studies.

1702
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,200
you buy something with which you identify as a lifestyle question.

1703
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:38,760
And we see the last part that I then discussed.

1704
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:40,720
We see an increasing or we saw an increasing

1705
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:44,400
a rough question more, a sort of meeting and a health rate.

1706
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,360
Between urban geography, cultural studies and anthropology

1707
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,600
as part of a broader spatial term.

1708
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,520
So this is the funny thing of interesting thing

1709
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,440
is that this cultural term often also

1710
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,040
until the spatial term.

1711
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,520
And it came as the emerge together in many ways.

1712
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,180
The last point I'll discuss is the research and informality

1713
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:04,320
and everyday life and related concerns

1714
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,280
as enormously contributed to a development

1715
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,780
of a truly interdisciplinary,

1716
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:11,280
transdisciplinary form of cultural urban studies.

1717
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,520
I think these are some of the,

1718
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,160
some of you see this happening in social science

1719
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:15,800
and science and science,

1720
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,120
that are not just at certain concepts, just resonates.

1721
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,840
We had research coming from very different traditions

1722
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,080
and then we come, let's say, bridging concepts

1723
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,520
that bring together very different ways

1724
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,000
of thinking very different histories of writing

1725
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,800
And this is where most of them are--

1726
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,560
well, the most exciting stuff happens I would argue.

1727
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,520
OK, next week, this is what I will try to discuss.

1728
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,840
So today, my main claim is history matters.

1729
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,600
So the history of urban studies that I just

1730
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,400
discussed shapes also current research debates

1731
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,920
on urban cultures.

1732
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:51,160
And before strands, I will try this class

1733
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,840
with you next week.

1734
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,040
So it is more.

1735
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:58,440
But I do think that this is pretty exhaustive at the same time

1736
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:02,760
are one on the arts, activism, and urban engagements.

1737
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,000
Just one strand.

1738
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,100
The second one specifically focusing on culture

1739
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:08,880
of infrastructure and informal urbanism.

1740
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,880
Probably a bit more on a culture infrastructure site

1741
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,440
than the informal site.

1742
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:16,160
A third one on urban tourism and consumption cultures.

1743
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:19,720
And a fourth one, which links most close

1744
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,600
and think to the methodological concerns, perhaps.

1745
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,080
It's also as a variable at the same time.

1746
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,760
Folks on sensory urbanism.

1747
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,200
So different kinds of, let's see,

1748
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:31,840
engaging with German beyond the visual and text.

1749
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,960
Again, there's only so much I can do

1750
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,640
into two hours that I have next week,

1751
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:38,380
but hopefully this gives you a pretty good overview

1752
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:41,480
of what cultures of urban research

1753
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,680
and urban cultures can be about.

1754
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:44,880
Okay, I'll leave it there,

1755
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,220
and I'm very fast for today.

1756
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:47,880
Any questions?

1757
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,680
No, everyone happy to go home at quality seven

1758
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,400
on a Monday evening, then I will see you next week

1759
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,800
if I don't see you in the fall.

1760
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,040
(applause)

1761
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,300
(clicking)

1762
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:02,300
(people chattering)



# 7 Urban cultures

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
I'll start recording immediately because I forgot to start recording for the lecture of

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,280
clear, at least for part of this.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Let me see here.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,280
[no audio]

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,280
[no audio]

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:36,280
[no audio]

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:59,280
[Silence]

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Can everyone hear me?

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,280
Yeah, I see shaking ass those goods.

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,040
I now also open to chat.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,040
I finally found out how to build the chat while

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,520
being in a formal presenting mode.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,520
I think it's about time to start.

14
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,680
Welcome to the second lecture for urban social geography,

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,520
where I'll be spending the next two hours.

16
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,040
Let's see how much time we need for electric urban cultures.

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,120
So as you remember in the last session,

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,800
I largely gave an historical overview of what I consider

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,280
to be essential, let's say, core coordinates

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,960
of thinking about culture in urban geography

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
and more widely some other, let's say,

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,600
related to discipline, starting with a brief discussion,

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,920
well, but there are relatively specifically discussion

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,160
on Fred O.G. Jameson and his notion of postmodernism,

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,840
moving to the shift of, moving to, let's say,

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,840
the 1980s, early 1990s debate on postmodern urbanism

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,920
and the LA School of Urbanism,

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,080
and then shifting to a wider,

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,120
but also related to the bait on the symbolic economy.

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,320
Those were the key coordinates that I tried to get across.

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,320
One of the questions, well,

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,880
you can't see the slides.

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,320
Can everyone see the slides?

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,160
Oh, that's odd.

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,280
Thank you for asking the question

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,560
because I'm actually screen sharing now.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,200
Let me just see, I'll just stop sharing.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:41,880
should be able to see this lights. Another sec. Share screen. I'll do it like this

39
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:52,400
done. So do this. Just a sec. Okay, now see my screen. Except that I can't see

40
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,160
you now just a sec. This is lots. I don't know one near you.

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:09,440
You never see the slides now? I see one yes thank you so I hope that's okay. Perfect. Okay.

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,680
Okay thanks a lot. Yeah feel free to unmute sometimes that's easier than working with

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:25,320
sign language. The only thing is I can see you now. Let me see where is that. Just

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,800
want to say, oh here we are. Okay, now I see you and hopefully you see me and we see

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,280
the slides. You did hear what I was saying, right? So okay, let's keep it from there.

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,240
So what I tried to get across last week is what I just discussed. I tried to give an historic

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,240
overview of some of the core elements that I thought I think were are important. Thinking

48
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,520
about every culture over the last 30, 40 years actually. Open some people in the waiting room.

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:57,720
My life is so easy. Let me see. Before you start working here, where are we? No, no, no, no.

50
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll stop sharing again. I'll admit all again at some point it becomes a bit tricky. Then people

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,200
that just have to wait for the next pause, otherwise it becomes difficult. Because with the

52
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,100
session of clear I could actually manage this but since I don't have an

53
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,620
assistant next to me this is what will work with okay next round we'll

54
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,300
we'll go for another ride here we go

55
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,740
Jabs and starts

56
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:39,220
this is valid that I don't see you anymore

57
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,220
Here we are.

58
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
There we are.

59
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Okay.

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,220
Getting there.

61
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,220
So, for the third time.

62
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,220
I tried to give an historical overview.

63
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
One of the questions I received last week is okay.

64
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,220
Are we going to learn more about actual cultures, so cultural expressions, stuff that

65
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,220
interests us as 20 years, 20 years.

66
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,220
That's what I remember.

67
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,220
So the question to the answer to that question is yes.

68
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,620
In the session today, I will focus a bit more in detail on specific, well, I will always focus on

69
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,460
research on urban culture, but look, assuming in more specifically on research that looks at

70
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,060
actual cultural expressions, but always from perspective as to how this has been done in urban

71
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,020
studies. There are many other disciplines, of course, that focus on culture or cultural expressions

72
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,580
coming from the humanities in particular, but I will largely zoom in on how this has been

73
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,160
in approach within urban studies.

74
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,100
That will hopefully become clear or clearer in a minute.

75
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,820
Before I do so, I want to broaden the debate a bit

76
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,460
beyond urban geography per se.

77
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,060
And I show some of the slides and discuss some of the slides

78
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,860
that I also already mentioned last week.

79
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,020
Because if you look at the way urban geography

80
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,580
has undergone its own cultural term,

81
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,980
as I hinted at last week,

82
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,340
What we saw happening in parallel is that many other disciplines

83
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,220
within the social science and humanities

84
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,740
have also undergone a kind of spatial turn.

85
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,620
So we've seen a kind of meeting health way,

86
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,500
a kind of rapprochement between geography becoming

87
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,020
a more cultural discipline,

88
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,060
but other disciplines also becoming more

89
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,100
becoming more geographical becoming more spatial.

90
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,620
So this cultural, this spatial turn had a number of reasons

91
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,140
as I already mentioned I think last week.

92
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,220
What did I'm being a post-1989 obsession with globalization?

93
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,180
So the moment you start thinking seriously about globalization,

94
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,500
you quasi automatically start thinking about spatial issues

95
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,260
about geographical issues because if it's here,

96
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,540
but also somewhere else,

97
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,820
you start thinking about connections.

98
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,060
The other one being a kind of critique of modernity,

99
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,060
which had really shaped

100
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,620
that they most of the social science and humanities debate

101
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,700
up until the 1970s,

102
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,780
which primarily sort of paid attention to temporal issues

103
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,300
time because that's the very logic of taking in terms of modernity. So what we've seen over

104
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,980
the years since the late 1970s, roughly speaking, is we've seen it's kind of de-emphasizing

105
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:15,620
of temporal issues and an emphasizing of spatial issues. And this is where the spatial turn comes in.

106
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,660
So this in turn, and this is what I want to briefly focus on for the opening of this today's

107
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,020
session, led to an increased interaction between urban geography, urban anthropology, and cultural

108
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,420
studies. Many other disciplines also, but for me those are some of the core disciplines that really

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:38,500
shaped the future of the research on urban culture at large.

110
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,900
Now there are

111
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:59,660
A number of core teams in urban anthropology and and or cultural studies that has shaped the late 20th century early 21st century trajectory of what I consider to be let's say interdisciplinary urban studies.

112
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,660
I'm not going to give a review here of urban anthropology or cultural studies. They're both fascinating disciplines.

113
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,660
I heard a lot more than most disciplines.

114
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,660
I mean, I was trained in cultural studies myself before becoming a geography you could say.

115
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,460
But there are two, let's say, teams that I want to briefly flag here, which I think have

116
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,620
a much longer history in anthropology and cultural studies, which have really picked up

117
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,460
in this scenario of studies and shaped this debate up to the present day.

118
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,180
The first debate being around what I lay on here is informality, as it kind of debate

119
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,020
that emerged in anthropology and development studies,

120
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,160
largely focusing on informal economy, labor markets,

121
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,380
precarious work, migration issue of workers,

122
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,620
legality and illegality distinction,

123
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,380
but also the regulation, so the political governance

124
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,180
of infomality.

125
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,580
I'll give a few examples in a minute.

126
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,100
The second core team that I think is important to keep in mind

127
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,100
as a kind of understanding of the history

128
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,980
of research on urban culture is research on everyday life.

129
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,860
That's a term that you don't see the term used that much anymore.

130
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,860
I would say in the last 10 years or so, you still see it a lot, but less so as a theoretical

131
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,860
concept.

132
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:24,540
But it was a term that was pretty much dominoes in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s.

133
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,540
Largely used as a kind of shorthand or kind of bus work for referring to issues around

134
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:34,780
agency, community, community building, also resistance issues, as well as consumption identity

135
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:42,780
questions and related to representational questions, which then in turn had often a lot to do with how things were represented in media.

136
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:52,780
So, everyday life refers to many things, just as informality refers to many things, but if you would have to give a kind of nutshell summary, this life pretty much covers the other thing.

137
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,340
Now briefly, if you think about informality within

138
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,820
biologic urban anthropology and development studies,

139
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,940
it's a term that was less used in cultural studies.

140
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,820
It's a classic team, especially from the early 1970s onwards.

141
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,660
The core reference and perhaps the first person

142
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,460
who coined the idea of the informal economy,

143
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,780
that many others, of course,

144
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,700
who did research on the informal economy

145
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,020
without labeling it as such, was key to art

146
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,460
and one of the classic articles,

147
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,260
So one of the first articles there is

148
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,180
the article from 1973, which is a title

149
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,620
"Informal Income Opportunities and Urban Employment

150
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,740
in Ghana."

151
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,140
The article is such that the case

152
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,940
that he is such is less relevant than the understanding

153
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,740
as to what he coined to this article,

154
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,060
or how this has shaped, let's say, subsequent debates.

155
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,180
So hard primarily focused on a number of things.

156
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,780
He focused on actual employment,

157
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,860
so people making a living beyond government jobs,

158
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,060
beyond factories and beyond large scale companies.

159
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,300
You know, say, okay, there's a whole world out there

160
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,100
of how people make a living, especially in Ghana,

161
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,820
but he then sort of extrapolated this

162
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,860
to urban Africa at large.

163
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,460
Say, okay, there's a whole world out there of work

164
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,580
that we actually don't see.

165
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,500
We don't capture it.

166
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,820
We don't see it because we don't have to vocabulary

167
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,180
to really pay attention to it.

168
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,340
So that's the first observation he makes there.

169
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,740
He then makes it, he bases this on a distinction

170
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,260
to informal and formal labor.

171
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,160
It says, well, all vocabulary that we have

172
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,960
is largely catering to, especially for economics,

173
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,020
to capturing, registering, and registering,

174
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,420
and measuring formal labor.

175
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,780
So labor that actually shows up in GDP,

176
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,940
values, et cetera.

177
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,620
Labor that is actually taxed.

178
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,220
And a lot of the labor that we see in our Africa,

179
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,900
you argue it's not taxed as such,

180
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,500
or we don't see it for that reason.

181
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,300
So he introduced this distinction

182
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,180
informal labor, formal economy, formal employment,

183
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,460
and informal employment.

184
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,660
He also then makes a distinction between illegitimate

185
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,300
and legitimate labor where he said, okay,

186
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,980
the jitterments activity, which is not the same

187
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,020
as informal and formal.

188
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,140
He says, okay, we can't have informal activity according

189
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,060
to him, so economically, which is not measured as such,

190
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,180
which is still the jitterments, which he then argues

191
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,540
those are activities that do actually make a contribution

192
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:25,500
economic growth but at a small scale. So if you let's say sell foods on on a local market but

193
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,380
this is not captured you're not registered as an official business this according to them is

194
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:37,180
legitimate in formal activity which I think most of us can actually agree with. And then there's

195
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,620
illegitimate informal activity where it says well that can refer to criminal activities but also

196
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,900
to for example to bagging or bribery or corruption, which you consider to be illegitimate.

197
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:54,580
So there's a kind of four-fold distinction which is really shaped the thing to debate.

198
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,700
And you can question and disagree with some of the specifics of his argument, but the

199
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,420
way he structured his idea has been quite important.

200
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,740
Now, I mentioned this here not because I want to discuss with you Urban Africa or 1973

201
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,100
a key thought, but because I think some of the classical landmarks studies that he and others

202
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,980
have done in the early 1970s have informed the debates that followed elsewhere. Inframality

203
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,300
is an interesting concept because it's one of the few concepts you could argue that has

204
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,140
really seen a concept from the global south to the global north. So where most of us are

205
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,100
very well aware of critiques toward, let's say, urban studies saying, well, it's actually

206
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,020
Eurocentric or at least Western centric. Inframality is one of those concepts which you

207
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,620
you could say, "Start it in the global south,"

208
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,420
and actually has been picked up increasingly

209
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,300
in order to understand also practices

210
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,740
within the global north.

211
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,020
To such an extent, I would argue that it's one of the few

212
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,860
concepts which really transcends this kind of global south

213
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,700
global law divide and really sort of contributes to

214
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,340
thinking in terms of a global urban studies.

215
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,220
So if you look at work, for example, of Ananya Roy,

216
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,740
or Jennifer Robinson, they have picked up

217
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,460
on the informality topic as a way of also thinking about

218
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,100
urban studies in more global terms

219
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,260
without being, let's say, Eurocentric or Western century.

220
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,100
They're all kinds of related terms,

221
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,460
and they all have to do, let's say,

222
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,020
this monetary specifics,

223
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,860
that are pretty much trying to cover the same field,

224
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,820
but I won't discuss here,

225
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
such as unregistered economy, black markets,

226
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,180
the non-observe economy,

227
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,860
undeclared work, or the shadow or hidden economy.

228
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,900
And for those, let's say, more trade and feminist theory,

229
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,180
it's quite obvious, let's say,

230
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,380
that the distinction to informal and formal

231
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,020
Washington also maps onto the distinction

232
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,820
between public and private, with public activities,

233
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,100
often being seen as part of the form of an economy,

234
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,700
but let's say private activities such as care work,

235
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,380
being seen as the informal economy,

236
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,820
often also not measured,

237
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,140
and thus supposedly not worthy of attention.

238
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,860
And of course, this has overlapped

239
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,460
and been involved in rethinking the terms of that debate

240
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,020
to an important extent also.

241
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,900
So in urban anthropology,

242
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,660
thinking about informality, you get the research on the opportunities but also

243
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,860
precarries created by unregulated economic activities. I will give some examples later,

244
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,300
but it's quite obvious for example if we fast forward, let's say, to research on

245
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,700
creating cultural industries, and research that has now been done on precarious

246
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,780
precarious artistic labor, for example. It struggles with a similar tension, where

247
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,420
the to a large extent artistic labor is also unregulated, which creates all kinds of

248
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,300
freedoms and opportunities, but at the same time this let's say this unregulated nature,

249
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,340
which makes it very precarious because there's no way you can actually support, well,

250
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,020
let's say where a state or a welfare state of other mechanisms can actually structure

251
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,820
the kind of economic activities.

252
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,560
Urban anthropology and historically speaking has also seen a strong interest in the

253
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
gender dimensions.

254
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,820
Of informal works, I've already hinted at this.

255
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,020
Partially in the home situation, partially in mostly females being women working on markets,

256
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:07,020
etc. So all kinds of gender in the exclusions that are part of this discussion. And again,

257
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:12,860
they have shaped the debates in the decades that followed. Also important things that

258
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,980
urban anthropology we see in formality being linked strongly to transnational dimensions.

259
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,980
So with the idea that informal labor market informal urban labor markets are often also

260
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:30,460
highly transnational labor markets. On one level with diaspora connections, people sending back

261
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:40,460
they are there earnings or part of their earnings to their home country, but also with many migrants actually occupying informal labor markets in in countries in cities across the world.

262
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:55,460
So there's the transnational connection which urban anthropology certainly was among the first to pay attention to, which I see an increasing amount of research in in urban and interdisciplinary urban studies.

263
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:01,220
example of the Montevos and Barcelona, for example, who often have an African background and who have

264
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,540
would live in relative, if you precarious situations, well, very precarious situations in Spain,

265
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,780
being sort of legal, illegal, semi-legal in different kinds of statuses and trying to make a living

266
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,260
in this case, Barcelona.

267
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:24,020
So that's a five-minute summary of a 40-year debate in urban anthropology. So apologies for any

268
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,180
of lack of solities, but my discussion is relatively instrumental here, and that I want to get across them.

269
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:37,380
The key, let's say conceptual elements, conceptual nuggets, you could say, that that's also

270
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,860
shaped a bit in interdisciplinary urban studies. A second term that I'm sure you've come across

271
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:52,100
before in your reading is everyday life. Now, both anthropology, but especially in cultural studies,

272
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,180
This notion of everyday life really shifted the bait and signifies in many ways

273
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,660
it concerned with the lift experiences and meanings constructed by subjects in their own world.

274
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:10,100
Partially emerging you could save in the 1970s as a chronic critique of supposedly structuralism

275
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:16,580
Marxist theory being more attention to agency so it's part of that 1970s 1980s debate but then also

276
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,620
increasingly moving into a let's say substantive empirical research where research started

277
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:30,660
being attached to the actual lift experiences and meanings of people. So people's active creative

278
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,180
agents rather than as passive consumers, this is kind of what sort of the broads into disciplinary

279
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:43,700
sprawling debate of everyday life signifies. Now there are many connections there I think within

280
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,540
different disciplines that have in one way or another tried to engage with everyday life with

281
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:53,120
or without using the concept, one which I will only hint at, I think here, but which might

282
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,480
be discussed in some more detail by those that follow, not everyone does, but depending

283
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,960
on your program, those that follow urban sociology of Ava Swindeau, there's a kind of

284
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,600
tradition of community studies in anthropology and cultural studies, which historically

285
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,200
has focused on participant observation and extensive theories of field work to really

286
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,360
gain trust and insight knowledge of everyday practices.

287
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,760
So basically an anthropological stance, you could say,

288
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,560
you become part of a community.

289
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,520
And only through this insight knowledge,

290
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,400
you will actually understand the meanings

291
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,920
and interpretations attached to certain practices.

292
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,840
It of course also has a history going back

293
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,520
to the Chicago School with research

294
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,040
on also ethnographic research on urban areas

295
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,320
and various, let's say, urban topics,

296
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,520
such as gangs, I think segregation, lifestyle,

297
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,440
delinquency.

298
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,160
But there's also a rule connection

299
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,960
where a special within our associateiology,

300
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,320
let's say partially in parallel to the Chicago school,

301
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,000
which was always more urban in orientation,

302
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,640
where some classic community studies,

303
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,360
especially in the 1950s and 1960s,

304
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,840
sort of started applying, you could say rural concepts

305
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,760
of classic community studies to urban settings.

306
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,440
So going into a supposed community and a setting

307
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,640
and then focusing on, let's say,

308
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,120
family and kinship relations

309
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,480
or traditions or rituals.

310
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,240
This kind of community studies that a literature has been quite heavily criticized over

311
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,720
the years, largely for being too localist or for assuming community as relative homogenous,

312
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,520
which was already problematic, you would say in a rural setting, but certainly it's problematic

313
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,440
and it's much more dynamic than dynamic urban settings.

314
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,840
It's the idea that communities actually share same values was increasingly questioned.

315
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,120
Because the tradition there often, let's say, focusing on everyday life of these communities

316
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,040
was already established by this kind of, this kind of minutured.

317
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,160
There is somebody waiting in their reading.

318
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:54,080
Let's see, because every time when I have to, but I might be able to do it like this.

319
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,480
Nope, we're already in the process of this area.

320
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Okay.

321
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,160
more. But I can do this all the time because it's quite interrupting so that I'll now start again.

322
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:13,000
You can still see me. Perfect, now I'll continue.

323
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,840
So especially from the 1980s onwards, I think we've seen a revival of the community studies

324
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,000
that moved beyond the kind of nostalgic motion of community. And this is where, so to

325
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:34,960
So again, the everyday life notions, well, returns in a way or becomes more present in

326
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,360
theorizing urban communities.

327
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,760
Some basic trends, and again, I just mentioned them here, but I think they basically

328
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,480
still structured a bit up to this day is that artists started using conflict theoretical

329
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,160
approach instead of collision theoretical approaches.

330
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,760
So looking at, let's say, interactions, obviously social interactions between actors, between

331
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,840
people, but also not sort of assuming, let's say, cohesion theoretically.

332
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,680
But assuming, let's say conflict theoretically, we could say very bluntly speaking, you

333
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,040
could say, instead moving from a dual-kymion perspective to a Marxist perspective.

334
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,680
That's very simplistic, but basically that's what covers to a certain extent the debates.

335
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,580
folks on network ties, local and trans local, I already mentioned this whenever I'm

336
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,800
anthropology, care and support and unequal and changing nervous settings.

337
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,240
And because of the, let's say the interest in, let's say, conflicts and how communities

338
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,160
are constructed, not how we, let's say, are assumed to be, there was increasing interest

339
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,440
to let's say the shifting symbolic boundaries between communities.

340
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,520
So they're sort of the making connection, but also making distinctions between, between

341
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,920
communities and between groups.

342
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,000
And then of course that opens up, let's say, the base

343
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,360
to not just communities as, let's say,

344
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,200
and uply, all the facts of social life,

345
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,760
but more into the base around communities of choice

346
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,080
and elected belonging.

347
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,680
So they can move into sub-cultures or LGBTQI communities,

348
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,560
but also gated communities, for example,

349
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,560
in urban settings, where people choose to belong

350
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
to a very separate community.

351
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,480
Now, the everyday is really a striking concept,

352
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,320
and let's say in the career of this concept,

353
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,200
because it's a truly transdisciplinary concept,

354
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,500
perhaps even more so than the informal informality.

355
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,740
Truly transdisciplinary,

356
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,240
maybe with a strong humanity background,

357
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,940
but really connecting cultural theory

358
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,500
with philosophy with Marxism,

359
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,640
with ethnography, with poststructuralism,

360
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,280
with sociology and with aesthetics.

361
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,520
That's precisely what makes this concept

362
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,880
that things so interesting,

363
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,440
was to influence you for research and our recalters.

364
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,520
Now you have to be careful here,

365
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,240
because the simple fact that a concept is used

366
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,160
all these different, let's say, traditions or disciplines, doesn't mean, of course, that

367
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,960
is used in the same way. So if you look, for example, that's, and there's no time to discuss

368
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,560
this here, but if you look, for example, that every day life in, in, let's say, ethnography,

369
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,200
it's quite different than every day life in aesthetics, and quite different than every day life,

370
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,120
let's say, in more post post structural literary theory. Yeah. So you have to be quite careful there.

371
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,000
But for every study is, I would argue, there are a number of approaches, which have really

372
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,160
let's say eternal references in a way, those artists that are continuously referenced.

373
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,640
One is the unavoidable home dealer, Fayetteville. Everyone references home dealer Fayetteville.

374
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,240
We see every day as a side of utopian possibility, but in line with, let's say, its Marxist

375
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,440
credentials also sees the everyday as colonized by the commodity form. So commodification,

376
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,920
logic, also shaping the everyday. That has been, of course, very influential thing.

377
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,920
in our studies to a large extent also because it's pretty compatible with the critical political

378
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,440
economic or studies approach. So people can claim or can become more interested in culture,

379
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,200
but don't actually don't have to leave. Let's say the house of political economy too far.

380
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,240
They can stay pretty close to that kind of debate. But I would also pay attention to other

381
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,480
moral, let's say perhaps empirically minded research, although still very theoretical,

382
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,360
and I will only mention two here, which have been equally at least influential, I think,

383
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:21,880
in urban studies. One being, the work by Stuart Hall, who is a massive towering figure, I think,

384
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,640
within cultural studies, British cultural studies at least, who looks at the everyday life,

385
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,560
largely true, you could see, especially in this book here, which is an additive book and a

386
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:38,840
compilation of classic classic papers of the British cultural studies center at that point in time,

387
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,880
the two looks at it to the subculture lens.

388
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,800
And the notion of subculture was coined

389
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,520
by British cultural studies.

390
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,920
And even though subculture is also word,

391
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,560
we tend not to use anymore.

392
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,920
Many of the, let's say, practices that we assumed

393
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,360
to shape subcultures are with us today.

394
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
So we might not name them subcultures anymore.

395
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,120
We might talk about the machines or about the networks

396
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,840
or something along those lines.

397
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,720
But the idea that subcultures are, let's say,

398
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,240
every day, but also are also kind of symbolic opposition

399
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,720
to a dominant social order.

400
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,360
This idea that they are one way or another resistance

401
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,200
is very influential, I think.

402
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,240
So if you look at the literature on, let's say,

403
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,200
subcultures, or let's say, neural literature

404
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,600
on protests, movements, or let's say clubbing culture,

405
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,720
it still uses these kinds of discounting for cavalry.

406
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
So that then directs attention,

407
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
to urban practices of resistance, but also style of fashion, of social practices,

408
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
or the particular codes that are used within a community,

409
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
added direct citation, I think also to a particular, let's say, generational category, namely urban youth.

410
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Which I think was really, has always been a recent in a way,

411
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
but British cultural studies tradition has perhaps directed most of his attention

412
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
to, let's say, this particular category of this particular generational layer.

413
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:12,200
layer. Typical of ever also for British cultural studies at that one in time is a certain

414
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,800
gender blindness. If you look at, let's say the early cultural studies tradition, those that

415
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,760
did research on subcultures, by and large looked at used cultures as you could say, boyish,

416
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,280
masculine used cultures. So there's certainly a certain gender blindness in the kind of

417
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,320
resistant use cultural literature.

418
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,280
However, this has increasingly been addressed

419
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,740
in subsequent work, partially and bachu

420
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,440
this kind of collup cultures literature that I mentioned.

421
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,840
Also by the work of artists such as Angela Megrob

422
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,480
who was part of the Early British Cultural Studies Foundation

423
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,200
and is now a professor at Goldsmith's College

424
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,160
and who has really addressed this kind of literature

425
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,120
and this kind of gender dimension of cultural studies.

426
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,080
Another order, and this is only a book I can,

427
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,920
Well, the other book also, but I certainly recommend you

428
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,840
to read this book if only because it's a very pleasant read.

429
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,440
It's beautifully written.

430
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,600
And it's not a tick book.

431
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,840
I think it has around 200 pages max I think.

432
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,040
It's pretty readable.

433
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,080
It's Michel de Sato and it's--

434
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,680
and it's--

435
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,320
he's written many things on a really live,

436
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,560
but this perhaps the most heavily silent book,

437
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,840
the practice of everyday life of 1984.

438
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,520
The-- having said the term, the English translations

439
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,320
from 1984 if I'm not mistaken.

440
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,080
It might be later that the original Franget is actually

441
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,120
from that time.

442
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,080
I will even look it up.

443
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,400
I forgot.

444
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,520
It's beautifully written.

445
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,120
It's perhaps more poetic, I would say, and less political

446
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,480
than British cultural studies, or at least less

447
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,720
in your face political.

448
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,640
But it has a vocabulary, I think, that has been very influential.

449
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,480
According to the Satoru, society is largely shaped,

450
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,640
and I think the binary nature of it,

451
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,280
the way you phrase it has been criticized,

452
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,880
but still it has been very influential,

453
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,600
but according to the society's largely shaped

454
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,120
by tactics versus strategies,

455
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,880
or strategies for some tactics in that order perhaps,

456
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,960
with a kind of state by a large use French, right?

457
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,640
So the city puts the state very central,

458
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,320
perhaps even more so that the economy

459
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,080
devices all kinds of let's say strategy structures

460
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,080
or does of social life,

461
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,600
against which we assistance as groups,

462
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,080
although you have a relatively individual focus,

463
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,480
devise all kinds of tactics in order to resist,

464
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,240
to avoid, to intervene,

465
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,400
so all kind of creative ways of dealing with strategies,

466
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,960
and sort of turning it around

467
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,800
and doing something else with it.

468
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,840
This is the kind of literature, which, as I said,

469
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,120
the binary nature of it,

470
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,680
that this idea that there is such a thing as strategies,

471
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,760
Let's say top down strategies versus bottom up tactics

472
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
because that's the kind of image you see.

473
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,440
It's problematic, it's too simplistic, I think.

474
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,640
But it has very much shaped this idea

475
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,640
that we have, let's say, media, cultures, shaping,

476
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,920
shaping things, but we are also creative consumers,

477
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,000
we can actually change and creatively interpret things.

478
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,960
Does a tool gives a very urban angle to this?

479
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,200
It really talks a lot about, let's say,

480
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,960
walking in the city, for example.

481
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,080
some of the walking literature and walking.

482
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,120
There's a door, it's one of the key artists there.

483
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
And it really looks at the key.

484
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,200
Obviously, there's a city which has been designed

485
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
and structured and constructed in a certain way.

486
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,960
But we as citizens, we can walk in the city

487
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,960
and sort of adapt and use a different line,

488
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,520
a route of walking, et cetera,

489
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,080
and ways not intended by the designers.

490
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,640
So it is then leads to a kind of literature

491
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,800
and kind of reader reading,

492
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,160
which looks at tactics,

493
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
everyday practices, I would say,

494
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,280
practices of everyday life as situated, it's often very local, sometimes as defensive in defense,

495
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:01,520
yeah, in defense too, but also sometimes opportunistic. You sort of pick up on some structured

496
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,080
elements and do something else with it. So that's the kind of literature and especially kind of

497
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,160
vocabulary, which again has shaped a lot of things, this idea of, of, of, I shaped a lot of research

498
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,720
on every day of life.

499
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Okay.

500
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
That's my first part.

501
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,260
I will just go to Quick Loop, but I see no one entering anymore because now I have pretty

502
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,720
much all chat box, not a box is open.

503
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,520
Are there any questions on this first part as a kind of first go on?

504
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:42,040
I see a question from Vera as James Scott, can you maybe explain this very critical

505
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:48,760
brief question. I don't see you so you're going to have to sort of speak up.

506
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:56,360
Now I was just thinking about the work of the de-structure, mission de-structure,

507
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,840
that you mentioned. And actually also James Cotely is from the same period. He published

508
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:08,520
the everyday life experiences of the pleasant etc. This talk about this

509
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,680
in for politics and matters stuff.

510
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,040
- Absolutely, no, it's very much part of the same reasoning.

511
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,400
So one of the other books that I could have mentioned

512
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,920
perhaps, but it has been less influential

513
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,600
in urban studies, but there's a great book

514
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,360
by James Scott also seeing like the state,

515
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,120
which is basically this kind of logic.

516
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,960
It's the kind of seeing like a state you could replace

517
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,800
that with the de Satoru vocabulary of strategies.

518
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,140
and then you have citizens, people, communities,

519
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,440
these perhaps more community oriented there,

520
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,660
partially shaped I think by the

521
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,240
anthropological background,

522
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,920
which is, which divides all kinds of tactics

523
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,000
as ways of resistance.

524
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,120
Not absolutely, it's that kind of debate.

525
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,800
Yeah, good question.

526
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,160
Any other questions on this first point?

527
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,880
If so, just speak up because that's easier for me

528
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,240
than go through the whole list of people.

529
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,240
No.

530
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Okay.

531
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Then I'll continue with the second part.

532
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Well, yep, indeed.

533
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,240
So a couple of lines of research that I'll say more contemporary.

534
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,240
So, current lines of research within urban studies that focus on urban culture.

535
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Within interdisciplinary urban studies, I think here we definitely move beyond the realm of urban geography,

536
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,800
geography narrowly defined.

537
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,200
And I want to discuss with you today.

538
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
The reason why I spend a fair amount of attention

539
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,080
to the previous art, to the previous debates,

540
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,680
is also because as you will see in the discussion

541
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,680
that now follows, is that the kind of vocabulary that these

542
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,600
kinds of debates use are very still influenced,

543
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,880
knowingly or unknowingly, unknowingly,

544
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,800
so by the previous discussions.

545
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,280
So by both issues on the symbolic economy,

546
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,200
postmodern urbanism, informality in everyday life.

547
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
So that really still shapes, I think,

548
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,760
some of these current debates.

549
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,480
I will now discuss all possible directions

550
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,120
in this area of studies on urban culture.

551
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,560
If only because culture is such a, let's say,

552
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,840
slippery concept and research has really explored

553
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,240
in all kinds of directions and as let's all kinds,

554
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,520
we could say sub-disciplines,

555
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,480
or let's say certain strands of research

556
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,480
that that would be impossible to do in a two hour lecture.

557
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,420
So I've been quite, let's say,

558
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,480
so lactate in a selection has been purely based

559
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,520
on my own preferences in a sense

560
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,080
that I'm going to discuss with you

561
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,640
the number of strands of research

562
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,120
that I consider to be interesting

563
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,440
or the most interesting strands of research.

564
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,360
Obviously, I also consider to be these

565
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,000
the more to be the more productive strands of research

566
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,920
and a lot of research is being done in this kind of field.

567
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,840
The first strand of research

568
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,800
to discuss with you and again a little pause at the end of this trend is around the arts,

569
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,440
activism and urban engagement. Research on the arts, of course, there's an established tradition,

570
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,320
obviously primarily in the humanities of aesthetic analysis of the arts. So of painting, of music,

571
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:20,160
of theatre, mostly actually, and increasingly so differentiating into different disciplines.

572
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,280
to your left musicology, you will have tiered studies, you will have a

573
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,520
let's see art history or visual studies and those are established

574
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,720
traditions off the web histories reaching back on the years.

575
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,080
Yeah, urban studies that even as an interdisciplinary field builds on these

576
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,120
traditions but actually it's primarily used as sociological and

577
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,240
or politically economic approach towards the arts and culture.

578
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,920
So some of the elements I will discuss here, they certainly do not capture the

579
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,360
diverse, the offer, let's say research on the arts that is out there. But they do pretty

580
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,920
much capture, I think, what's out there within nervous studies. So the more social scientific

581
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,880
approach towards the arts obviously shapes the kinds of questions being asked. So one

582
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,080
result of this is that we also see through the critical focus on, let's say, the political

583
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,480
economy of the arts, we also see it in many, well, with many

584
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,520
odds, that many in many publications, an interest in the political or

585
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,000
critical potential and practice of the arts.

586
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,040
Yeah?

587
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,120
This is partially also a response to, and doesn't something I will not

588
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,960
discuss in detail here, to a relatively dominant debate on the creative

589
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,080
and cultural industries, which has really shaped the think that the

590
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,040
debate on the arts in the last 20 years, this idea that creative and

591
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,000
cultural industries contribute to, to let's see our, our contemporary knowledge economy that

592
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,200
they are a key economic sectors in, in our, in our current cities. And thus we're the strong focus on

593
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,480
economic dimensions of culture. This interest, you could say the political potential, the critical

594
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,280
potential of the arts is also partially a response to this. There are longer traditions, I will discuss

595
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,600
some of them, but this is a way of also trying to look at the creative industries the big

596
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:10,360
critically say okay well actually we miss out on a lot when we do not address the let's say the

597
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:17,400
resistant dimensions of the arts. Now the dream well there are many of course but I'm

598
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,680
summarised in here as three main lines of every research on the arts and I will discuss them

599
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,960
briefly in turn. One perhaps the most established line of research also because it ties in I think

600
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:38,360
with a history of research in, well, in our theory, basically, and in our history.

601
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,320
There's research on public arts and/or site-specific arts, the terms overlap.

602
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,360
A second line of research is research on artists and urban social movements,

603
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,200
the relation between artistic practice and urban social movements, and of course,

604
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,360
social movements, being established to bait within urban studies also.

605
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,240
And a third literature is literature,

606
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,040
this perhaps the most cultural studies oriented literature,

607
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,240
is literature on popular culture at urban politics.

608
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,000
So it's literature that that's increasingly engaged with,

609
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,280
with Lacy also theoretical,

610
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,440
philosophical literature on the political,

611
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,920
and how public culture plays a role in relation to urban political questions.

612
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,040
And I will discuss, of course, what I mean with the political here,

613
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,080
because it's not institutional politics per se, or if at all.

614
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:39,680
Now, the first line of research within this section is public art or site specific art.

615
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:46,540
For your readings, I added an admittedly relatively long chapter by Rosalindoyce, a New York

616
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,320
theorist or apologies for the length of the chapter.

617
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,840
But I included it because it's, well, for two reasons.

618
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:00,080
goes in the knowledge is a key art theorist, key cultural theorists who very early on I think

619
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:06,880
understood the productive connections between art theory and urban studies or geography,

620
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:15,120
critical geography. And erodes in the 1980s and 1990s a few foundational papers on the arts and

621
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:22,240
the urban. The paper here is called uneven development, public art in New York City. And basically

622
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,720
covers, I could say, a history of dealing with or engaging with public art in New York City

623
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,880
both by let's say local governments, local, the real estate developers, or let's say project

624
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:42,640
developers and artistic communities. I could have chosen other articles, the many other articles

625
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,480
possible. In the same book by the way, and I think I included the full book. There's also a great

626
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,040
critique the feminist critique of of Jameson and Harvey by way. I think the the chapter is called

627
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,240
Men in Space if I'm not mistaken. So basically she devices that you develop as a feminist ethnographic

628
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,240
critique of Jameson and Harvey. So I could definitely advise you to read this also. But in this

629
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,880
particular paper she basically develops a critique of the intimate utilization of public art.

630
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,680
So an emotion of the public by local governments and developers. So this idea that public

631
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,760
the way it's presented or used by local governments and developers,

632
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,920
since if it goes working more on planning,

633
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,160
in many countries you will have, if you have a kind of building scheme

634
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,360
or a local planning project,

635
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,960
a certain percentage of the budget needs to be spent on public art.

636
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,240
Now, for those who notice in most cases,

637
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,320
there is rarely a lead, in many cases,

638
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,640
there is a lot of, in most cases,

639
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,080
this does not lead to very interesting types of art.

640
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,480
It's a kind of tick the box, exercise,

641
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,240
in some cases, of course it does.

642
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,240
So she develops the critique of how public art

643
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,680
is instrumentalized in order to further,

644
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,640
you could say, the uneven development of New York City.

645
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,160
So it's shaped by elite concerns

646
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,400
and shaped by politically economic concerns.

647
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,760
So public art becomes a kind of legitimation device

648
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,120
for uneven development.

649
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,120
You should briefly refer,

650
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,040
as I mentioned here,

651
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,080
because I like the term pseudo-polar public sphere,

652
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,060
which is a critique of Alexander Klug and Anatyiris

653
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,960
on this idea of how a massian kind of ideal public sphere

654
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,600
as a field of deliberation.

655
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,800
I said, well, actually there's very little actual dialogue

656
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,120
taking place.

657
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,520
But she also hints at him.

658
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,840
This is something that, for example, Nancy Fraser

659
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,400
and other theorists later also developed

660
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
in more detail, perhaps, to this idea

661
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,040
of the emergent oppositional public spheres.

662
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,440
Yes, there is uneven development,

663
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,480
but it kind of sued a public sphere.

664
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,900
But we also see kind of oppositional public spheres emerging.

665
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,080
Public spheres, which on top of that,

666
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,880
have a heavy emphasis on, let's say, cultural and aesthetic dimensions.

667
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,440
So basically, often artistic communities

668
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,760
that are related to actors being engaged

669
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,000
in the design of oppositional public spheres.

670
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,400
And again, of course, this especially

671
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,000
for those interested in the arts,

672
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
has been a massive influence

673
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,600
in thinking to what kind of role can the arts play

674
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,640
in the urban and in urban development that much.

675
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:21,640
Now, here's a nice quote, a thing by adoration that summarizes, basically, this kind of

676
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,680
idea and the critique also.

677
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,760
So the idea that art cannot assume the existence of a public, but must help produce one,

678
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,640
and that the public sphere is less a physical space than a social, nullify to consider

679
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,360
a considerable extent, except that the vision is being public and non-public art.

680
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,520
potentially any exhibition venue is a public sphere

681
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,720
and conversely the location of artworks

682
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,800
outside privately owned galleries,

683
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,320
in parks and plazas,

684
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,400
were simply outdoors,

685
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,520
hardly guarantees that they will address the public.

686
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
Now, I'm sure that the discord prep needs

687
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,200
a bit of unpacking, right?

688
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,240
But basically what you're trying to get at here

689
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,080
is in the first sentence,

690
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,440
is that we cannot assume that by simply let's say

691
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,720
putting public art on a public square, for example,

692
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,240
We cannot assume that we automatically address the public.

693
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,760
People just don't mind not engaged with it.

694
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,560
People just that might just be there,

695
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,200
but that doesn't really make a public.

696
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,520
We can only make a public if it actually actively

697
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,240
engage with people.

698
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,360
So you actually have to construct a public.

699
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,760
And this is more than what most public arts,

700
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,440
supposedly public art achieves.

701
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,360
So this is the first question,

702
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,040
the question even the first critique she has. The second line is okay we this

703
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,160
actually leads if you think through the logical conclusions of this it means

704
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:53,320
that it simply putting arts in the out in the open doesn't make public art

705
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,480
but it also means that for example you can have public arts in a gallery

706
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,980
as long as you engage with the public this obviously would constitute public

707
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:09,660
So she critiques this distinction within much of our theory of that time that relied on this idea that

708
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:16,060
a critique of, let's say, modern art is that you move out of the gallery and into the public.

709
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,620
She says, "Well, actually, yes, that's a good idea, but it doesn't really make for public art per se."

710
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:26,220
So this is basically the kind of, let's say, dichotomy she's playing with and that are important.

711
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,220
I think to keep in mind.

712
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:36,220
Sure, some of the most important thing is to keep in mind to the start that we have in our

713
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:42,220
objects, but this art object needs actual engagement with an audience, with the public,

714
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:51,220
in order to become public. That's important to keep in mind here.

715
00:44:51,220 --> 00:45:01,940
bit more concrete she has one very famous example by an equally famous artist, although not at

716
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:07,220
the time, I think he was still relatively young in his career at that point in time, which is

717
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:16,340
Richard Serra's tilted arc. This example is also discussed in the paper by Doytchen. Now, as you can

718
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:23,260
see on the image here, this is quite obviously an intervention in public space, right?

719
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,740
It's a massive piece of work.

720
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:32,500
It's a 37 meter long and 3.7 meter tall steel plates on fully square, which is in lower Manhattan,

721
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,660
New York.

722
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,660
Yeah?

723
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:41,940
So if anything, this is a kind of public artwork that you cannot ignore, obviously.

724
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:50,680
The way this according to Deutsche, the way this artwork has been sort of, let's say,

725
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,380
interpreted or let's say received, it really shows some of the problems of public art as

726
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,820
she made as she sees it.

727
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,620
Some of you could say some of the more conservative voices or sort of use of the public

728
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:09,380
space, have me criticize this piece of art because it blocks their way of passage, obviously,

729
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:16,900
If you look at the image, it completely makes impossible the usage of the public square

730
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:23,780
by, let's say, workers working moving from one building to the next.

731
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:28,260
At the same time, Deutsche Argyz, well, this doesn't necessarily make it public arts,

732
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,380
and some of the exaggerating claims made by critical, let's say, defenders of this piece

733
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,860
of work.

734
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:39,580
They have really focused, you could say, on assumptions as the shifts in behavior of

735
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,900
the supposed juices of this space.

736
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,220
So without actually talking to people, without actually engaging with their own interests,

737
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,780
they have assumed that the very fact that people have to sort of re-articulate their, let's

738
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,740
say, everyday practices, that they're led to a more aesthetic engagement with the public

739
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,740
space.

740
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:03,540
Now, according to Doris, the main problem of the discourse around this piece of art, as

741
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,620
lot of the piece of art itself, this that it relied on a very narrow aesthetic

742
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,420
reading, so ignoring actual uses of urban space to very generic

743
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,860
claims on a static uses of the square. So actually it's a kind of public art

744
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,740
intervention, which refuses to be public because it doesn't engage any sense

745
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,420
with the public. So this idea that the public involves a dialogue

746
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,580
is completely ignored in this sense. It's basically an ultimately

747
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:39,580
strong artist figure putting an art piece in the public square without actually becoming part and engaging with the public.

748
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:47,580
This piece was also removed in 1989 after years of critique but as perhaps a side note for the debate here.

749
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:59,580
The counter example perhaps the oppositional public sphere you can argue that the doji uses and I think this is a bit an artwork that has also been picked up by artists such as Neil Smith who also wrote a

750
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,740
to also roll a piece on this.

751
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:05,940
It's just of what just goes to homeless vehicle projects.

752
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,980
Also a public arts space,

753
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,740
but a different kind of animal.

754
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,980
So here in this case, a vehicle decided,

755
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,900
I had a lab by the way when looking at this picture

756
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,420
because I'm pretty sure it is the trunk tower in the back,

757
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,620
but that's something else,

758
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,580
which at that point, it's not that less of a,

759
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,500
less of symbolic value perhaps than it has now.

760
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,980
That's a different kind of animal.

761
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,420
It's also public art, also metal in many ways.

762
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,780
But here, it's a vehicle designed by artists,

763
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,700
by the artists, sorry, in singular,

764
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,140
in consultation with homeless people.

765
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,500
And it was seen in a different way.

766
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,620
It was seen as a practical tool

767
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,140
for managing everyday life of the homeless.

768
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,900
So in this thing, which you can't let the expand

769
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:53,100
when it's placed somewhere,

770
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,060
it was a space for washing, for sleeping,

771
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,860
but also for storage space, for example,

772
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,040
for collecting empty bottles or something.

773
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,500
So all this into one vehicle.

774
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,420
Vehicle, sorry.

775
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,140
This was both an exhibition object,

776
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,500
which was exhibited in USA Classic galleries,

777
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,900
as well as an object for actually making visible

778
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,340
the homeless in public space.

779
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,500
So I think on the basis of this example,

780
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,740
you already feel a bit,

781
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:23,740
the kind of different approach used towards the public

782
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,180
by this piece of work or by the previous piece,

783
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,340
by Richard Serra, because here there is an engagement

784
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,380
with specific urban users,

785
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,500
highly marginalized to use on top of this,

786
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,780
and thus, implicitly or explicitly,

787
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,140
a critique of uneven urban developments,

788
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,100
because it's a piece of work that is situated in public space

789
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,780
and makes visibly percadia effects of uneven urban developments

790
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,620
on a wider group of, let's say, urban users.

791
00:49:53,620 --> 00:50:08,620
Okay, maybe to wrap up here on this, on this first strand of research.

792
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:14,540
So these are all examples of site specific art that moved art beyond the exhibition space

793
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,540
into the urban.

794
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,540
So there was a thing within art theory and art history, kind of internal critique of the

795
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:25,820
art world. We have to move out of the museums, out of the galleries, but also a broadening

796
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:31,820
or as a result of that also, a broadening of a static debate to either social concerns.

797
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:38,620
So this then leads to notions such as going by critically, in this case, by a health foster such

798
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,660
that the artist has a nographer, which looks at the role of the artist in the collaborative process,

799
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,740
or the artist has a participant of the reserve, so the artist has an ethnographer.

800
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:54,380
So the critique of foster is also, and this has been picked up in later work also,

801
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,620
is that the globalization of art market, and this is where I say different disciplinary debates

802
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:03,500
also become interesting, that the globalization of the art market, there's something rarely addressed

803
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:08,140
sufficiently, I think in other studies, leads, for example, to commissioning of artists to produce

804
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:14,540
community-based site-specific artworks, however, without a clear knowledge of the local context.

805
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:21,740
So we see that by annual logic, for example, the art festival logic, where artists are flown into

806
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:26,380
particular sites in order to develop community-based work, but they are adding to the community.

807
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:34,300
So often these are, let's say, all you superficially speaking, public works of public art.

808
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:41,020
And again, so much of this was foreshadowed, I think, by the work of Dolce also, but of course,

809
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,020
those others at this point in time.

810
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:51,180
So that's the first strand of research.

811
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,940
The second strand of research is around

812
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,580
artisan's urban social movements.

813
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,580
And of course, I'm making analytical distinction here.

814
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,540
In practice, some of these debates go over lab

815
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,100
and there are interactions.

816
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,660
But for the purpose of discussion,

817
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,700
I think it's helpful to keep them a bit separate.

818
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,980
So the second strand of research

819
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,300
tries to look at artisan urban social movements.

820
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,300
So there's a long, standing tradition obviously

821
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,380
of artists engaging in social movements,

822
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,860
but mostly those have been a research

823
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,500
I would argue outside of urban studies.

824
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,020
Again, we didn't let's say the fields specific debates

825
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,940
such as theater or such as visual studies

826
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,180
et cetera art history.

827
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,780
Within urban studies, I think most of the recent debates

828
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,180
in this area has been the only critique

829
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,820
of the creative class and creative industries

830
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:43,540
policies as I've already hinted at, or perhaps neoliberal or entrepreneurial urbanism more widely.

831
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:50,020
So what kind of role you are to play in or part of urban social movements in critiquing,

832
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:58,020
you could say the neoliberalization of the urban. Now there's a nice paper actually by

833
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:04,340
a UNist Novi and Kleakkulon, who many of you have seen attended today, who wrote a nice paper

834
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:07,980
We're struggling for the right to the creative city in Berlin and Hamburg.

835
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:15,060
I really give a nice brief, brief, but nice overview, I think, of urban social movements.

836
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,940
So it's a kind of literature which I, well, we don't really discuss the thing at our

837
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:24,620
social geography, that's an important literature, which moves from the history of squatting

838
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:30,820
and demonstrations against a renewal politics to urban counterculture.

839
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:34,180
then zoom in on the role of artists and cultural workers in contesting

840
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:39,540
color-created class and creative industry's politics. Now there's a lot that can be said about

841
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,460
this but what is interesting here of course is that automatically debate becomes you could say

842
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,340
sociological or social scientific because the moment you start looking at artists within social

843
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,580
movements you can no longer look just at their aesthetic expressions but you automatically have to

844
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:58,100
look at what is practically speaking their role within an often quiet heterogenous diverse

845
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,500
composition of protest movements. So we see artists collaborating with diverse

846
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:08,280
set of actors and that of course shapes their artistic practice. The role of

847
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,500
artists here, at least this is what no being conno highlights, I like strongly

848
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,860
I think they are definitely onto something there, is that artists to some

849
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,180
extent have a privileged role or a particular role within the urban social

850
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:24,380
movements because they have access to an experience with media networks and

851
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:29,740
and the familiarity with communication techniques. So this then leads to a discussion around the role of

852
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:36,300
artists in how, let's say particular urban conflicts are framed and reframes by artists in often

853
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:45,500
visual or other ways. And many examples you can discuss here. This is one example discussed also in

854
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:51,260
the article of the "Media Spake" quote "test in Berlin". For those that know Berlin, you will know

855
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,820
probably also know sort of the history a bit of media. I will not discuss this here. It's a big

856
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:02,780
urban development area on let's say well there's a southern part of really signed northern part

857
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:09,900
of Keweisbach partially which really lets us look at the counter mobilization because there's

858
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:16,620
also the area which is let's say a concentration of artistic and and and leisure and

859
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,220
and clubbing activity.

860
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,620
So here's a one simple example where sort of artists

861
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,500
you could say have been involved in developing

862
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,100
different, let's say, visual aesthetics.

863
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,180
And it says this basically ironically

864
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,380
builds on the B-BERLIN branding scheme.

865
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,700
So those who don't know it, just Google it.

866
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,140
And it uses the same kind of design.

867
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,300
But then changes the kind of language.

868
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,860
And sort of ironically, so instead of being

869
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,860
being creative and being a foyer, but how to translate that.

870
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:50,860
If I can translate that, being used and thrown away.

871
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,860
So this is a lot of viable.

872
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,860
Yeah, commodifiable is perhaps the closest.

873
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,860
Thank you, very, very good point for me and Basas,

874
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,860
but you're right, commodifiable.

875
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,860
And they replaced it by Zizamesgrystim,

876
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,860
so I saw the Dari-Zizai-Rita-Stun, so it could be self.

877
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,860
Again, difficult to try itself.

878
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:18,500
So, independent something on those lines, we saw the solidarity and be resistance.

879
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,460
So stop gentrification.

880
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,740
So this is one example.

881
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:28,900
Other examples, of course, not discussing this particular article, but from other other

882
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:34,500
sites, of course, this kind of artistic, let's say framing, or political and urban conflicts

883
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,860
ties in with a much much longer history of art and protest.

884
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,820
Most obviously in street art as well as graphic design.

885
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:45,100
So a couple of examples that are, let's say, illustrative of this,

886
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,620
but certainly not exhaustive.

887
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:50,300
So on the top right, you see a performance protest of an extension,

888
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,100
extension rebellion, protest in London.

889
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,620
The middle left, I think, has been quite similar to most of you

890
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,140
who think the Black Lives Matter, painted street.

891
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,580
I think this one in the Washington DC.

892
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:10,380
or to the bottom right, claim state, well, if they're painting, stating the

893
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:15,340
low to the depth repayments, street arts, intervention, and Buenos Aires.

894
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:21,420
And I've could have used many, many other examples, but just to give a sense of

895
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,140
the rare sort of artist play a role in urban social movements or at least a

896
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:30,140
protest if it's less organized than a social movement.

897
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:34,940
And again, this has a much, much longer history going back many, many years.

898
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,780
Some would argue since the emerged of industrialization in many ways.

899
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:43,980
So the last,

900
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:52,380
the last rant within this section that I want to discuss with you

901
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,060
is public culture nerve and politics.

902
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,620
This is, last you could say, let's, around urban social movement,

903
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:05,980
it also lasts around the art world as such, but more about more broader cultural expressions.

904
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,980
So here we really go back to the classical core of cultural studies that it discussed before

905
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:16,540
with you. So here is a focus on popular culture as in everyday life, as questioning authority,

906
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:23,100
but also as imagining political alternatives. So the kind of language that we then use or see,

907
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:28,780
use and this kind of research is that it's about politics beyond governments and politicians

908
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,820
to become the street politics as a second by the ad call that's also kind of informalization.

909
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:38,780
This is where the informality that turns pops up again as you see. Informalization of the state

910
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:44,460
as for example Julia and Boudgo as called it. Nice book by the way.

911
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:52,100
Again, there are many, many examples here to discuss.

912
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,820
The classic case I would argue in this field of research,

913
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:59,340
it is hip hop or rap music more narrowly,

914
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,820
which has been studied by now, I think,

915
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,500
by multiple multiple disciplines,

916
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,460
range from musicology, cultural studies,

917
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,860
and anthropology, but also urban studies,

918
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,420
which traditionally has focused,

919
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,180
I think, strongly on a kind of classic cultural studies,

920
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,100
community orientation, urban localities,

921
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,820
So the hood, the ghetto as classic urban teams,

922
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,940
but we also are thinking in a more critical literature,

923
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,700
has paid attention to, let's say, the way

924
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,420
hip hop culture has become, let's say commodified

925
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:31,620
in its globalization of its cultural form.

926
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,860
But also how it has been picked up by people

927
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,580
from outside of, let's say, the US,

928
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:40,900
as supposedly the source of hip hop culture.

929
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,060
So that's the classic case.

930
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:47,420
libraries full of books by now I think on hip-hop. Some more interesting than others, this book by

931
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:53,340
Marie Forman is quite an interesting example though. Similar research has also been done

932
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:58,300
on other genres. Typically a lot of attention has been paid to music, we see it in other fields of

933
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,620
activity, also but music has received perhaps most attention and relation to popular culture and

934
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:07,340
the political. A range of from clubbing culture but also to opera although the political perhaps

935
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:12,700
less obviously there to punct to jazz to all kinds of other cultural expressions.

936
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:25,900
Now what all these strands amount to is that they point to different aesthetic strategies to

937
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:32,620
engage the urban. Yeah, and this is something that, well, has also increasingly received attention

938
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:38,620
in our studies. In an article about Timon Bayes, I put a reference at the bottom of the slides.

939
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:44,220
He points to a number of different aesthetic strategies. As I said, as I write here,

940
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:48,860
they are politically distinct, but in practice, of course, they are messier. Some,

941
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:54,620
some, let's say, aesthetic practices might be involved in a number of things at the same time.

942
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:59,500
Here we said, "Okay, we basically have spectacle, grassroots, social work,

943
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:06,140
are rising the senses and you can automatically see it to how so many examples I've shown before

944
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:10,700
can be one or more of these things. So let's say for example the Black Lives Matter,

945
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:17,820
let's say Banner on the street so to speak, in a way you could argue this is grassroots,

946
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:22,620
you could argue this is also social work, you could argue it's tough somehow it also arouses

947
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:27,220
the consensus because it's sometimes it questions the norms of what these

948
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,140
trees are for and questions differently say media representations but quite

949
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:36,220
obviously it's also a spectacle because it's a really sort of traveled

950
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:41,020
widely and can easily be used in kind of commodification strategy almost of

951
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:45,140
branding almost particular cities yeah so there are all kinds of different

952
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:49,140
dimensions and it's in a very good question ultimately to look at concrete

953
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:55,140
artistic practices to look at what the different dimensions, let's say the relation to each other is.

954
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:03,860
Okay, that's a long stretch for one slide, but it might also be one in the longer

955
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:10,740
longer discussions. I'll take a short break, near for questions. So please

956
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:17,380
just either type them in the chat or just start unmuting and speaking if there are any questions on

957
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:22,820
this section. Maybe it gives me a chance to do even more.

958
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:28,340
Wow, that was a pre-prepared question. That was a fast or

959
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:32,660
unless you type very fast. So Olica Aces a question

960
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:37,140
or a point. I want to raise attention to your related phenomenon, where an

961
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:41,060
artistic, creative approach is used in part

962
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:44,420
of a broader participatory and redevelopment strategy.

963
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,820
Here's some sort of institutionalizing of arts

964
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,420
and their movement is happening.

965
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,220
A small quirky teams of architects, planners, activists,

966
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,980
and artists are leading the process.

967
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,420
And sure, an example, AAF and then there's a website.

968
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,980
Maybe, Olic, you can--

969
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:01,100
so if I understand you correctly, we won't look at the example.

970
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:05,340
Now, then, it's your point being that artists

971
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,620
can actually become urban developers themselves.

972
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:12,260
Olic it.

973
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:17,820
I don't see you so you have to unmute the weekend.

974
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,620
Now I see you, but your muted.

975
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:20,140
All right.

976
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,220
Sorry.

977
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,140
Yeah.

978
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:22,780
Exactly.

979
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:27,500
Like artists are becoming part of the planning process

980
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:27,900
or more.

981
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:35,900
I think that the low threshold approach of artistic

982
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:40,180
experimental, like creativeness, as being employed

983
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:45,180
in order to justify maybe participatory processes

984
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:48,580
or lead to a more inclusion of people

985
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:52,820
or let them participate in the first place,

986
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:57,180
but also just to get the people on board

987
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,380
and create some sort of tolerance.

988
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,020
So this one would be like the creative,

989
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,380
what is it called?

990
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,300
The festival of creative urban living in Milton Keynes.

991
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,380
the UK, England.

992
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:19,140
So yeah, it sounds like coming from a very dry urban planning

993
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:19,900
background.

994
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,300
This is like a weird thing to do.

995
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,580
Because people who are attending this there

996
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,620
usually not aware of the broader scope

997
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,220
of this whole development that's happening to them.

998
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:34,900
So that's just interesting to also take a look at.

999
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,340
It's a good addition, something that I don't explicitly

1000
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:41,740
mentioned here, but it's a it's a neurology new trend I think, certainly something that we see

1001
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:46,700
more and more of. I mean it was there before, but that become more visible, I think in the last

1002
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:53,020
10 years. I would still argue though that the same kind of critical vocabulary already introduced

1003
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:57,500
by Deutsche is also necessary for these projects, because in some of these projects and initiatives

1004
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:04,860
at least we do see a relative instrumental or instrumentalization of artists. I.e. not the one artist is

1005
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,060
is not the other artists, right?

1006
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:10,120
So we see certain artists standing up

1007
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,180
as entrepreneurs, you could say,

1008
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,260
and becoming project developers

1009
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,900
in relatively uncritical ways.

1010
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,900
And I can name some examples also in Brussels

1011
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,380
where this is happening,

1012
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,820
which actually leads to a fair amount of critique

1013
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,580
also within your artistic community.

1014
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:32,220
- Yeah, and I wouldn't say that this is necessarily

1015
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,780
like a bad or a good thing.

1016
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:41,460
The teams that are involved are really good teams, but it's just like always look very critical

1017
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:48,340
because also the urban governments try sometimes to use this strategy and not in a very deceiving way.

1018
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:54,740
Yeah, okay, excellent. Thank you. I see another comment or comment literally by VIA. Please unmute.

1019
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:02,260
Yeah, but you already rise this critic from the Dosh, what is her name?

1020
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:09,060
Dosh, yeah. And is also the critic from Zurkin, like this tricky fact of the art,

1021
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:18,100
we also the vehicle of gentrification and stuff. So always super tricky to speak about the

1022
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:22,260
art and its puttain shaw in your run and space, let's say.

1023
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:27,060
but yeah absolutely so I'll give another example later on I think also which which raises this

1024
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:34,100
questions and the article I mentioned by sorry I can go back I can go back. About Timon Bass

1025
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:39,380
I also mentioned some of these ambivalences that are seemingly unavoidable so to speak there's

1026
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:43,620
no pure space in that sense. Okay excellent and then there's Max also has a comment.

1027
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:51,300
I just add on this point that Ulricha raised and a

1028
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:57,620
this theme of institutionalization and instrumentation of art and artists.

1029
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:02,340
I think Amsterdam is actually an interesting example because there is this

1030
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:06,020
municipal policy which could be translated as the

1031
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:12,580
breeding ground policy whereby the city assigns certain buildings as

1032
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:19,300
available for workshops and for artists to work there and often it's also very related to

1033
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:28,580
yeah strategy actually to gentrify a particular area I don't know whether there's any

1034
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:34,020
research done on this plus maybe you know. It has been definitely also by the Amsterdam

1035
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:37,940
College Law Service Strong Service Studies Research Edition at the University of Amsterdam but also

1036
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:40,460
others. No, no, that's been critical. We should be in

1037
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,540
none of it. And that one's just a particular case. It's an

1038
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,180
interesting case in any case because it's it's very

1039
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,940
elastic, advanced, professional and industrialization of

1040
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:52,460
the arts, the urban level. And the bootplasm, the breeding

1041
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:57,300
policy policy policy is yeah, it's it's striking in the way

1042
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,980
it's sort of well, use and test positive side effects also,

1043
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:05,140
but the way it little really uses the arts in in relative

1044
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:10,140
classical urban development strategies. That's definitely true. Yeah, not a research

1045
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:15,140
I've been known in that. Yeah. Okay, excellent. Thank you for the comments. They really

1046
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:22,140
add some very important additional thoughts here. Other points, if not, I continue with the

1047
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:31,140
third part of the presentation and that's the another section or direction of research on

1048
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:36,140
on the arts or on culture and the urban.

1049
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,540
This is what I would call,

1050
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,140
or this is basically my label,

1051
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,520
but I think it's what I would call

1052
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,780
research on cultural infrastructures and informal urbanism.

1053
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,740
So this is where the lesson in the literature on the informal

1054
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:49,020
actually starts broadening to, let's say,

1055
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,140
literature on informal urbanism,

1056
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,940
which might be a phrase that you've come across

1057
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:54,740
also a number of times.

1058
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,180
And this overlaps the thing in recent years

1059
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,660
where increasing attention has been paid

1060
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,580
to let's think the infrastructure dimension

1061
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:02,020
of urban cultures.

1062
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,640
Some scholars have already talked about

1063
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,860
an infrastructural term.

1064
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,820
I disliked talking about terms

1065
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:09,740
because it's very claiming a new fashion

1066
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,300
and it helps to get cited more,

1067
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,140
but yeah, there are so all these things built

1068
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,500
on all their interests also.

1069
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,540
Having said that, there is obviously more and more

1070
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:21,020
attention being paid within our studies

1071
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,580
to let's see questions of infrastructure

1072
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,060
and not just narrowly defined,

1073
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,620
but very diverse types of infrastructure,

1074
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,100
as you will see.

1075
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,460
Now, to hear one example, I think which is a good example

1076
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,780
or it discussed by the team and base article

1077
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:37,460
that I mentioned before, which you discussed in this article

1078
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:42,060
is the work of the Chicago based RSTS targets,

1079
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,540
some of you might know him,

1080
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:47,180
where to the left you see a piece that you did

1081
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,940
for the document,

1082
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:57,460
well, not by annual, but document a five yearly festival

1083
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:04,100
in Castell, so the document 2013, which I think was in 2012, even correct. 12 ballast for

1084
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:09,940
Ugunot House, which basically is a restoration of an empty building in Castell using labor and

1085
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:15,460
materials from the south side of Chicago. So it's an interesting case because it was a kind of rundown

1086
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:21,140
building in Castell where we had, let's say, where the 30th of the case, the artist had materials,

1087
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:27,380
but also workers moved transported, so to say, from Chicago to Castell to actually renovate the

1088
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:32,900
stability and to actually perform in the building, et cetera.

1089
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,220
So here's space and let's say the infrastructure

1090
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:38,260
of this space really emerges a kind of social space,

1091
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,140
while at the same time directing attention

1092
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,340
to migrant labor and in the case of the SDK,

1093
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,060
it's work and the kind of the issues

1094
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:48,100
it engages with with black cultural expression

1095
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,380
in a very particular space in Castle.

1096
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,780
So there's a very, let's say,

1097
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,900
concrete artistic intervention.

1098
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:58,180
To a right, you see, let's say, in a way,

1099
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:02,420
the reference project for the castle, the castle case,

1100
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:05,940
which is a door chest project, the projects in Chicago,

1101
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,420
which is basically you can argue,

1102
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:09,300
and it links back, I think, to the previous,

1103
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:14,340
well, addition raised by the Liliq,

1104
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,140
but perhaps in a last, let's say,

1105
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:19,860
planar move, and basically this is a kind of urban

1106
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,940
development project led by TS to Gaze in the south side

1107
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:24,260
which it could go.

1108
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,460
Where it gets started buying up abandoned property

1109
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,940
after the 2008 financial crisis

1110
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,740
and has redeveloped these buildings with local communities,

1111
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:36,580
with other artists, often creating a mix

1112
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:39,340
of artists' spaces, of community spaces,

1113
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:41,300
of, let's say, local restaurants,

1114
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:45,940
or in this particular case, also a library and archive.

1115
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,040
So the Dorchester project.

1116
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,620
Now, what's interesting here, of course,

1117
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:56,060
that we are still in the realm of let's say issues around urban

1118
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:58,780
culture but we've started being more and more attention to

1119
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,660
where practically literally, materially speaking,

1120
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:05,100
are these located. So this really leads them to the material

1121
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,380
infrastructure dimension of urban culture and some of what I

1122
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:12,060
consider to be some of the more interesting, more productive line of

1123
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,060
research on urban culture in the last years, as really looked at these

1124
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:28,220
kind of infrastructure dimensions. Another pushing does a bit broader and perhaps also

1125
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:36,060
becoming less local and is orientation towards infrastructure is a book that I added for the

1126
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:43,980
reading for today by Brian Larkin from 2008, Signal and Noise Media Infrastructure at Urban Culture

1127
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:49,340
Nigeria, which is for those that have rats. I don't expect you to have

1128
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:54,140
rat the full book, but maybe maybe the introduction at least, which is an

1129
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,820
anthropological study on the cultural work of media technologies.

1130
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,820
There's the quote and they're rolling what in producing what we call urban

1131
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:06,860
Africa, focusing on Kano and Muslim city in northern, Islamic city in northern

1132
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:11,820
Nigeria. The lock-in book is interesting because it's just a very interesting

1133
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:18,620
book but also because he flax a number of the base that are, let's say, essential in

1134
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:24,300
research on infrastructures in general or cultural infrastructures in particular.

1135
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:29,860
One being, it's not just about, let's say, pipes, etc. and literally infrastructure,

1136
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:34,500
but also a lot about the symbolic or representational logic of infrastructures.

1137
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,540
So what do infrastructures mean?

1138
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:37,540
How are they interpreted?

1139
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,540
How are they envisioned?

1140
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,580
How are they imagined?

1141
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:44,580
This really receives a lot of attention to think in most of the infrastructure research.

1142
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:54,580
Also, attempts of governments to govern or control these infrastructures, it gives examples of this in the case of Nigeria.

1143
01:13:54,580 --> 01:14:00,580
At the same time, also, the unexpected or unintended consequences of infrastructure development.

1144
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:04,580
Governments, for example, or let's say our local developers can have a plan,

1145
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:12,580
I can't have an idea as to why do you want to develop a certain infrastructure, but it doesn't necessarily mean that infrastructure is also used in this way.

1146
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:20,580
So here we're back a thing to perhaps do the all the discussion about strategies and tactics, but transpose to an infrastructure discussion.

1147
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,920
And the last element related to this, of course,

1148
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,120
is that around these infrastructures,

1149
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,360
we see all kinds of informal social practices

1150
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,000
in everyday life emerging,

1151
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,360
which then are worthy of attention,

1152
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,880
but also worthy of research.

1153
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,760
So the example here I gave, for example,

1154
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,560
you can easily, if I would completely imagine

1155
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,280
how around these spaces, social practices emerge

1156
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:44,360
and are developed.

1157
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,120
And they would perhaps not exist

1158
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,000
without these infrastructures.

1159
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,520
And that's the thing, the importance

1160
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,920
want to keep in mind here.

1161
01:14:51,920 --> 01:15:00,880
Nightly, exactly. It gives, and for me, the most interesting chapter in the book is perhaps

1162
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:07,520
the last chapter, if I remember correctly, on the role of piracy in Nigeria.

1163
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:14,960
So, the example he gives, for example, is how Nigerian video and piracy and circus of distribution

1164
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,680
emerged in Nigeria and how this actually relates to a kind of a

1165
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:25,280
perhaps which goes called a full ecosystem of cultural but also obviously economic activity

1166
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:32,000
largely informal in the sense that it's barely regulated perhaps also illegal or

1167
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,160
illegitimate or something because it's often at that point in time when you did this research

1168
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:44,080
late 19th early 2000s often copies illegal copies of Hollywood and Indian films

1169
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,240
But we're with the same incandel as in Northern Nigeria city,

1170
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:53,680
really emerging literally as a kind of distribution hub for the wider African region.

1171
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:57,520
Yes, so with people on the right for example, selling it on the street,

1172
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,600
but also the same people of other people actually moving the goods so

1173
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,160
to the speed, the material from one city to other cities, often crossing boundaries.

1174
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:11,440
Now from the 1990s onwards, I think we've seen an increasing production also,

1175
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:16,160
and this is the the the argument developed by Larkin of Nigerian and especially

1176
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:22,000
housing language videos leading to a quite organized system of how is that video film production

1177
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,960
but it building on the existing fire and infrastructure. Yeah so again a classic case of informal

1178
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:36,240
urbanism a very slippery or unclear distinction between where when a something still informal when

1179
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:40,960
when does something become formed? Because it has also become part to a certain extent of a formal

1180
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:46,400
registered economy with some business and growing bigger and bigger. But at the same time with,

1181
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:51,760
for example, how has the films aesthetically and organization still been shaped by you to say the

1182
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:59,040
older pirate aesthetics and infrastructure. This is also the kind of research which has received a

1183
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,680
lot of attention in recent years, which I have ever labeled here as being part of, let's say,

1184
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,040
research on cultural infrastructure and informal urbanism.

1185
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:19,520
Or to give another example of paper I wrote myself to get away with a PhD student a while ago

1186
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,120
called Spaces of Open-S Urban Citizenship and Cultural Infrastructure,

1187
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:28,160
to come alive at Istanbul, which focused in Latte in a more institutional way perhaps,

1188
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:34,320
less ethnographic way on the institutional geography of collaboration and support to sustain

1189
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:40,000
local cultural spaces and networks in the shadow of the states. So the argument we develop here is

1190
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,920
that in a Turkey and partially also an Istanbul, increasingly being let's say shaped by kind of

1191
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:52,000
authoritarian, semi-authoritarian state in any case, we discussed in some detail how particular

1192
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,960
cultural organizations salt and depth of the North Coast as Istanbul, they might know the organizations,

1193
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,560
how they act as kind of cultural infrastructures

1194
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,680
of, let's say, common life or a different way

1195
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,560
when we're saying, "Oh, actually public life in Istanbul,"

1196
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:11,640
largely by actually collaborating with very many other organizations,

1197
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,040
but also offering spaces.

1198
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,800
And this is what the image to the right shows--

1199
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,680
sorry, what this image shows--

1200
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,680
offering spaces--

1201
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,760
well, sorry, offering actual space in their buildings

1202
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,080
to all kinds of different organizations.

1203
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:31,280
So you see a kind of let's say hidden or semi hidden cultural infrastructure,

1204
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,200
which doesn't easily show when you look at just the main cultural organizations,

1205
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:39,280
but which really shaped you could say cultural practices in this particular city,

1206
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:45,680
and which is only possible or in any case is made possible by the actual existence of these

1207
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:54,800
actual spaces in the city of Solvindepo. So again, another possible, let's say, entry point,

1208
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:00,400
inter-measage on cultural infrastructures and informal urbanism.

1209
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:07,000
Last point perhaps for this slide, well that's not the last example, is what we see happening

1210
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,720
in the research and cultural infrastructures.

1211
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:13,080
Much of the research on urban culture is research that is most, you could say, fundamental,

1212
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:19,640
let's say, basic, basic real academic research, but it also has a strong applied nature.

1213
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:24,000
And the notion of infrastructure has also started, it emerged or started popping up in

1214
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:30,560
policy documents across the world. That has many consequences, not all of them positive, but to a

1215
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,520
large extent of things is an interesting development where we let's say cultural policy documents and

1216
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,960
cultural actual cultural policy practices did not refer to infrastructure last say 10 years ago.

1217
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,240
We see in the last five years or so we see various organizations, very local and regional governments,

1218
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:53,120
actually using the notion of infrastructure in order to pay attention to certain, let's say,

1219
01:19:53,120 --> 01:20:01,360
infrastructure dimensions of cultural industries also. So here a few examples on the top left

1220
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:06,080
creative city news, cultural infrastructure, an integral component of Canadian communities.

1221
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,320
This is quite strong and again I think it's critique of the creative industries literature,

1222
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:15,760
even among policymakers where we say okay we actually need a wider diversity of cultural

1223
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,200
infrastructures that actually connect with our local communities, whatever that may mean but that's

1224
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:26,960
the last 80 a game. Or for example, sustaining London as a cultural capital, why London needs

1225
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:32,080
the cultural infrastructure plan. This again is not a strand of the debate, I think in policy

1226
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:37,440
communities where we see because of the increasing, let's say gentrification and increasing real estate

1227
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:44,480
price in especially global cities. Even policy makers, let's say mainstream policy has started

1228
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:49,040
realizing that if we continue like this, we're going to have no artists left in the city. So we need

1229
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:54,320
need to actually start thinking about the availability of cultural infrastructure in our cities

1230
01:20:54,320 --> 01:21:00,880
and to make this available literally in order to sort of keep, let's say, the status of

1231
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,600
London as a global city but also as a cultural city. So why London is the cultural infrastructure

1232
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,560
plan? It's similar to the bit around cultural infrastructure at New South Wales, which is

1233
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,280
this mixed-setting also of the Canadian example I just mentioned and the London example of

1234
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,320
available in your space.

1235
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,360
Or another example in Brussels, and this is what

1236
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,200
I'm partially involved in by a panamanan,

1237
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,680
so permanence, the name of the association

1238
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,240
pretty much sums it up, which is a practice-based research

1239
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,200
I'm also now involved in where we try

1240
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,880
to develop an infrastructure for permanently affordable

1241
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:36,760
and about its social and cultural space in Brussels.

1242
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,840
So basically claiming a space in Brussels,

1243
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,600
which is open not just to artists,

1244
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,160
but also to other types of users, such as refugees,

1245
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:48,520
such as social housing, such as university researchers,

1246
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,720
et cetera, in order to look at different models of ownership

1247
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,840
also, where artists are no longer reliant

1248
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,320
and are used on, I say, temporary use,

1249
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,560
but they can actually, let's say, permanently,

1250
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,040
literally, permanently claim space

1251
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,440
through all kinds of ownership models,

1252
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,280
partially building on issues around less

1253
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,440
the community land trust or social co-operatives.

1254
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,360
Okay, that's a lot of information.

1255
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:20,200
Just to sum this up, if you look at the cultural infrastructure in informal urbanism literature,

1256
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,560
I see at least the following analytical shifts.

1257
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:28,800
We have moved, I think, from a concern with the informal economy, in anthropology and

1258
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:34,600
development studies and everyday life tactics and cultural studies to informal urbanism.

1259
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,840
This is the term that is perhaps the most present now.

1260
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:43,000
It's no longer informality as such, but the phrase informal urbanism you see constantly.

1261
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,920
So we've moved to a situation where, sorry, here we are.

1262
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,840
And we see continued interest in labor questions,

1263
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,200
social and badenness of economic relations

1264
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,400
and interrelation of informal networks

1265
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,680
and informal institutions.

1266
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,800
So all the classic informality discussions.

1267
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,400
But at the same time, we see a diversification of topics.

1268
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,480
So it's no longer just about,

1269
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,880
you could save informal labor markets.

1270
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,880
No, it's also about DIY urbanism.

1271
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,520
It's also about co-working space.

1272
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,620
There's also about urela gardening, about co-housing,

1273
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,840
or about artistic interventions in public space.

1274
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,240
It's also about squatting.

1275
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,460
There's also about self-built housing,

1276
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,160
and the list is endless, yeah?

1277
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,040
All these kinds of practices, of course,

1278
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:28,120
each with their own, let's say approaches and styles.

1279
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:32,000
You see all these kinds of practice being labeled

1280
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,720
as expressions of informal urbanism.

1281
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,440
There's a legitimate question to ask,

1282
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,760
how useful such a slippery term is,

1283
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,680
but it has certainly led to a broadening

1284
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,600
of empirical interest.

1285
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,480
As already mentioned before, I think the term informal

1286
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,000
has really helped to move beyond a global style

1287
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,640
first global north studies on cities

1288
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,480
and to really look at the informal urbanism

1289
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,040
as global urbanism.

1290
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,920
Whether the informal in a way has become foundational

1291
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,120
to our understanding of cities at large.

1292
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,520
And the last point I'll skip for now is less ascension.

1293
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,560
Okay, I need a set of water.

1294
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:14,760
questions, please, or comments or additions on this part.

1295
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,000
If any.

1296
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:29,120
Maybe I could ask a question about, let's say,

1297
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,000
these structures, these infrastructures

1298
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,720
growing in the shadow of the state, as you have mentioned it.

1299
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:37,640
So we noticed that actually a lot of communes in Brussels

1300
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:42,640
are trying to set themselves on the, let's say, cultural map.

1301
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:46,920
We are working in urban analysis on the community for her,

1302
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,040
that has its own like a very active plan

1303
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,320
and wants to be a leader and a new place for art

1304
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,800
and culture in Brussels.

1305
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,640
- Yes.

1306
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,640
- I wonder what your take on that was also working with

1307
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,880
with the association that you mentioned,

1308
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,840
you must be seeing also a different side of the influence

1309
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:09,520
of local government in Brussels on that.

1310
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,560
- Yeah, exactly.

1311
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,560
Yeah.

1312
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,080
I mean, I mean, asking a question about a city in which

1313
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,400
I live, of course, is always difficult

1314
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,960
because I can talk about this for hours.

1315
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:22,480
But it's a tricky, I mean, I would say for that

1316
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:26,320
to a logic stance has become a creative or cultural hub

1317
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,800
for artists, which obviously is,

1318
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,880
despite for municipality.

1319
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:39,520
As often happens in Brussels is not because of the government that we see interesting activity happening somewhere.

1320
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:44,960
Brussels is a city that really relies on strong, let's say,

1321
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,720
well, social movements and citizen activity.

1322
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,080
And there's also applies a thing to artistic activity for it.

1323
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,720
Have we said that what, of course, which is now see happening is that because for there,

1324
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,240
It has become, let's say, a concentration,

1325
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,920
let's say, for artists, we do see, of course,

1326
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,320
that local municipality is increasing also using this

1327
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,160
to in a way to brand itself, right?

1328
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:14,960
To, as such, there is nothing wrong with this.

1329
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,040
I mean, I don't live in Florida,

1330
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,320
we need to look into very specific local details

1331
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,840
at the same time, and don't have the feeling

1332
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,400
that they have a strong strategic perspective

1333
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:31,400
on the role of arts and culture and the municipality.

1334
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,720
So it doesn't, and that's applied,

1335
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:38,920
it doesn't get to my knowledge, move beyond,

1336
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:42,160
they kind of offering of temporary,

1337
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,640
intermuse spaces for artists.

1338
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:47,480
So it doesn't get seemed to be a kind of broader,

1339
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,600
let's say more substantial perspective on this,

1340
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,400
but maybe you already know more about this

1341
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,880
through the human analysis

1342
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,920
and the work that you've done so far.

1343
01:26:54,920 --> 01:27:03,600
I think we definitely see a lot of policy claims for sure and a lot of use of it.

1344
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,520
So now indeed it's a next challenge to look into how that actually plays out on the ground

1345
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,080
and whether that actually translates into action.

1346
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,560
But thank you for your reaction.

1347
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,560
Yes, thank you.

1348
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,560
Are you a comment as well?

1349
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:25,520
Last year I did a literature study about gentrification in Brussels, especially in the

1350
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,960
region of St. John's Mullenbeck.

1351
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:36,480
We saw in the 80s the Commodoto vartists start living there.

1352
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:43,840
So it became very popular to live there and the results was for people, for people need

1353
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,560
to move out.

1354
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:52,980
So I guess there is always a small dark sites of this one,

1355
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:56,640
we'll just do gentrification especially in Brussels.

1356
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,880
Yeah, I mean, I can only say, in short, yes, to that.

1357
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,040
[LAUGHTER]

1358
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:06,240
Yeah, I mean, there are different opinions on gentrification

1359
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:06,920
in Brussels.

1360
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,440
I mean, some would say, well, there's

1361
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,320
clear gentrification and there's expansion.

1362
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,880
If you look at the numbers that might the actual expulsion of people from

1363
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,080
Circle Look at these might be limited still, but it's clear that certain areas

1364
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:26,080
are changing rapidly. One of the things we're trying to do, which for example,

1365
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,640
the permanent project I'm permanent project I mentioned, is to also think

1366
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:32,960
about spatial because one of the problems is let's say artists move into

1367
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:38,000
certain spaces. They are looking for, let's say, work and living spaces, but in a

1368
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,720
way, unintentionally so they then actually lead to a push out effect for

1369
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:46,720
other for adolescent poor citizens in most cases.

1370
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,440
At the same time, it's not as if artists are belonging

1371
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,880
let's say to an urban elite in general.

1372
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:55,160
So one of the very small level of retries

1373
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,640
to do with the permanent project is also

1374
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:00,800
to try to think of, let's say, spaces that are co-owned

1375
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:05,320
and where let's say the move of artists into a certain area

1376
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:08,000
does not automatically translate into the move out

1377
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,200
of other citizens.

1378
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,960
Realistically speaking, of course, my position on this

1379
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:18,920
is that this can only partially be solved on a project level

1380
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,400
because practically speaking, you simply need more social housing

1381
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,360
for this.

1382
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,760
And most of this is disastrous city

1383
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,000
when it comes to percentage of social housing,

1384
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,680
let alone quality of social housing.

1385
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,640
We're really talking about a few percentages

1386
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:36,320
of the total housing stock, which is social housing,

1387
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,920
which is completely different, for example,

1388
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,760
in a city such as Amsterdam,

1389
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,960
which has also seen gentrification obviously,

1390
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,040
but that's the social housing stock.

1391
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,800
Definitely helps there with all his own complexities

1392
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,400
and problems.

1393
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,240
So yeah.

1394
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:54,800
Any other comments?

1395
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,840
No, okay.

1396
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:04,840
Then I'll move to the last section I think of the session.

1397
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:09,400
I think we're more or less okay on time, which is good.

1398
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:13,840
So I did, I promised last week that I would also have a separate section on tourism.

1399
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,840
I don't.

1400
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,080
So I didn't manage to fit it in.

1401
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:20,560
And it's picked up in some of these elements implicitly, I think.

1402
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,760
So I'm also less of an expert on urban tourism.

1403
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,160
I know the literature quite well, but it's not something that I do research on myself.

1404
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:32,720
But this is certainly also, let's see, another strand of research, which is interesting

1405
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:35,080
from an urban cultural perspective.

1406
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:40,320
However, the last strand I want to discuss with you today is literature which is perhaps

1407
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:46,720
more closely related to the humanities than some other elements that I discussed with you today,

1408
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:52,640
which I flag here as the research on sensory urbanism, visual cultures or sensory urbanism,

1409
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:57,040
and then two examples, visual cultures and sounds.

1410
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,880
Brian Locke is text that was on your reading for today already highlighted, I think, how

1411
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:06,800
media technologies and aesthetics shape urban places. So this idea that actually by building

1412
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,920
certain distribution infrastructures, by having certain places, you actually shape urban places

1413
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:17,360
through truly technologies and aesthetics. In term, and this you could see is, let's say, the more

1414
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:23,120
experiential, phenomenological or our user point of view, this implies also that places are

1415
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:29,040
experienced through multiple senses, seeing, listening, smelling, touching, tasting. Now,

1416
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,760
Historically, most research has focused on the visual dimension.

1417
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,520
But increasingly, we also see it, and this

1418
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,680
has a long, long history.

1419
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:38,240
I'll give a few simple examples in a minute.

1420
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,920
But increasingly, we also see the attention

1421
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,840
paid to other senses.

1422
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,360
And I'll briefly discuss this to research, which I think

1423
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,600
is pretty interesting, but obviously,

1424
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:50,760
in bias, because I tend to like, mostly, or focus mostly

1425
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:54,000
on music and sound myself.

1426
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,680
But I'll briefly discuss some of the research

1427
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:00,840
on the auditory culture, sonic cultures, or music and sound.

1428
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:05,480
Now, to start with the visual culture spots,

1429
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,760
so remember Jameson.

1430
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:10,440
So this is, let's say, the hotel that we've already discussed

1431
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:13,560
in Jameson text 1984.

1432
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:16,200
Basically, you could say one element of,

1433
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,120
if not star architecture, but at least,

1434
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,560
let's see various sort of in-your-face architecture.

1435
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:26,520
And within our studies, a lot of attention has been paid to this kind of architecture,

1436
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:32,960
So based to buildings designed to leave a strong visual impression because that is what these buildings do and what they aim to do

1437
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,520
Now the analytical focus starting already in the 1980s

1438
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:42,560
Some elements have let's say survived the years others have not has been on cognitive disorientation

1439
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:50,480
But also on landmark statements in a city with emphasis on spectacle and surveillance with emphasis in consumption landscapes and

1440
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,880
An emphasis on represitation and global attractiveness

1441
01:32:54,320 --> 01:33:02,200
So this is all you can say well rehearse territory within urban studies and which has a long history of of analysis

1442
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,440
Now star architecture you literally

1443
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:09,560
Ads value to world cities are aspiring world cities

1444
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:14,000
So the architecture becomes you could say an urban icon in global rankings

1445
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:22,360
It really helps and here is it there is a tourism reference. It really helps to put world cities on the map for tourism and consumption purposes

1446
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:29,560
these sites or the surrounding areas become sites for business investment or also for upmarket

1447
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:36,920
Residential houses. So they literally had value to aspire the world sees true legacy strong visual claims

1448
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:43,560
Now this has this of course has a history, right? This is not we have we should not be naive

1449
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:48,280
Let's historically and leave and pretend that this is something of less in the post for this age

1450
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,240
or something that we've only seen since the late 20th century,

1451
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,920
although it probably has a increase

1452
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,520
and probably, let's say, more,

1453
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,880
let's say, professional and strategic attention

1454
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,760
is now being a paid to, let's say,

1455
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,720
the visual dimension of cities compared to the,

1456
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:08,320
let's say, the decades before.

1457
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,760
But it has the much longer history.

1458
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,480
The most obvious or let's say a classic example,

1459
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,160
of course, being the Eiffel Tower,

1460
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:17,960
which itself was built to put Paris on the map

1461
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,000
or to make it more visual again.

1462
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,880
Part of, let's say, if a broader exhibition set up,

1463
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,360
originally intended temporary,

1464
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,680
but has been therefore quite some time,

1465
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,920
which now is a classic landmark case in,

1466
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:33,120
or example in, whoops sorry,

1467
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:37,480
around the world when people think about Paris.

1468
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:42,280
Or another example,

1469
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:45,720
so I'm working with two computers here.

1470
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,680
So this is sometimes confusing.

1471
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,600
Another example, the Opera House in Sydney.

1472
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,400
Again, an example, even if you've never visited Sydney,

1473
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,200
you will know this building.

1474
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,200
The Opera House in Sydney architect,

1475
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:01,960
Jion-Otsan, or another example, which I think by now also

1476
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,720
everyone knows, which is perhaps in a way

1477
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:07,080
the more recent example, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,

1478
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:13,720
Spain, which in its very setup was intended to leave

1479
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,880
you could see a visual impression.

1480
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,880
And you will see that many people visit the Google

1481
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:21,000
NIMU's email bill bow without seeing anything else

1482
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,880
or a very little of bill bow as such.

1483
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:28,520
So I would dare to claim that the vast majority of people

1484
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:31,200
that visit the Google NIMU's email bill bow

1485
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,160
will leave the city without really knowing much

1486
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,480
about bill bow.

1487
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,760
Yeah, I mean, there's not a question if they should be.

1488
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,440
It should.

1489
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,760
But it's clear that this kind of visual attraction

1490
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:41,920
plays a key role.

1491
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:45,120
and has played at the same time in an almost role

1492
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,640
in increasing tourism flows towards global.

1493
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:51,840
Or even more recent example, the Elfilam,

1494
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:56,840
the Afro-Hos in Hamburg, 800 million euros,

1495
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:00,760
enormously over budget, which is very typical also

1496
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:03,320
for someone that allowed to start architecture.

1497
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,320
But in general though, and not surprising perhaps also

1498
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,240
is that many of these buildings are cultural landmarks

1499
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,360
that both offer you the same culture

1500
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,120
and a design space for tourism and consumption.

1501
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:17,680
So this, as I said, this is well-rehearsed territory,

1502
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,280
still a lot of interesting research is being done on this,

1503
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:23,440
but it's quite established in the base.

1504
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,960
I'll give some example.

1505
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:28,080
Of course, that leads to all kinds of discussions also

1506
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,840
about who has the biggest tower,

1507
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:33,200
I won't go into the masculine connotations

1508
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,800
of building the world's tallest building,

1509
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,720
but it's quite obvious here, the Gosh Khalifa,

1510
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:43,600
And also a thing in this is perhaps a shift which is new work,

1511
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,680
although also not completely new,

1512
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,480
is that especially in the same world global cities,

1513
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,480
such as New York, such as London,

1514
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,960
we see a lot of entice being paid by private developers

1515
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,040
to very upmarket elite residential housing.

1516
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:59,800
So this is height one in London, for example.

1517
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:06,560
It is interesting also because there's somebody's space

1518
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,560
for upmarket residential housing,

1519
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,240
They are built to leave a visual impact.

1520
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,240
They are built to attract buyers, multi-buyers.

1521
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,320
But let's say they're running jokingly or low.

1522
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:17,520
The sadness of the story in many ways

1523
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:22,200
is that if you look at how, for which period of the year,

1524
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,680
these apartments or buildings are actually occupied

1525
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,920
by actual inhabitants is often quite limited.

1526
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:32,240
Some of these are just apartments to park, to park like money,

1527
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,120
but not necessarily laundry money,

1528
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,960
but not necessarily actually lived there for us

1529
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,520
state is a substantial period of the year.

1530
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:48,400
Or another example in New York for the 4-23 Park Avenue.

1531
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:53,280
Perhaps less spectacular, but maybe in 10 in a similar direction,

1532
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:58,000
these visually speaking, is this building at the Canal Zone,

1533
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,400
the upside tower in Brussels. But the prices are certainly more affordable

1534
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:06,000
than the word the price you will see in New York or London.

1535
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,160
Now, what's interesting about this visual culture, especially in sort of new media times,

1536
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:17,760
is that these landmark statements, these are actual buildings, these are buildings very

1537
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:25,040
much, let's say, very costly investments in urban space. But the vast majority of people

1538
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:29,600
will know these buildings, they will see these buildings through social media and online

1539
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:35,840
magazines or maybe let's say a coffee-tailed book magazines. So these buildings play a massive

1540
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:41,040
an important role in city branding and hopefully attracting cultural tourism and also in

1541
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:45,840
circulating on social media. So you've got images such as this where as the local Instagram

1542
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:52,800
is a search for star architecture or spectacular architecture you will see loads of images or even

1543
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:59,600
Let's say in New York using using, let's say, certain space or new builds in New York

1544
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,800
and labeling it as best Instagram spots.

1545
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:06,960
And then you get these interesting, let's say, tourists who basically photograph themselves

1546
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:12,280
with the building in the background as it kind of goes, let's say I've been there kind

1547
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,280
of attitudes.

1548
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,440
But it's quite obvious where sort of the spectacular architect plays a key role not in

1549
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,480
in relation to questions actual use,

1550
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:23,000
but Lashi and request in relation to questions of re-presentation,

1551
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,720
and how can you actually,

1552
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,960
how well these images look like on Instagram

1553
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,200
or other websites.

1554
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:35,120
Now, this is,

1555
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:37,160
it's perfectly this is interesting.

1556
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,160
These are new phenomena with longer histories,

1557
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,720
but very interesting.

1558
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,560
Theoretically, you had raised certain questions

1559
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:47,120
about how we should look at city developments,

1560
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:51,200
how we should look at how cities change over time.

1561
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,040
This ties in, I would argue with a literature

1562
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:56,240
on what is sometimes called geographies of circulation,

1563
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,640
where we really try to understand city cultures

1564
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:00,480
as an effect of circulation.

1565
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,600
So not necessarily designed locally,

1566
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,320
but actually images traveling between cities.

1567
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:08,240
Of course, also traveling of architects and other experts,

1568
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:11,520
but also concepts, images, plans, best practices.

1569
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,160
So where urban culture as such,

1570
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,120
perhaps also urban policy as such,

1571
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,800
becomes a kind of practice of inter-referencing.

1572
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,460
So the city's referencing each other,

1573
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,360
or building's referencing each other,

1574
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:26,040
to stake out the claim, so to speak.

1575
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,560
Now, all this links back in my view,

1576
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,680
although not always recognize the such within the Middle

1577
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,680
United River studies, to classic cultural studies concerns

1578
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,960
with the politics of representation,

1579
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:37,960
but also to an anthropological interest.

1580
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,280
And there's a very nice book and article,

1581
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,240
but I am up a duet I already from the late 1980s,

1582
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,200
on the social life of objects.

1583
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:49,680
So how do objects travel true space and true time?

1584
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,800
Okay.

1585
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,480
Last section for today,

1586
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,400
because this is our set,

1587
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:58,200
is it's well, well,

1588
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,000
it's trial and theory within nervous studies

1589
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,280
to really look at the visual

1590
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:04,120
in relation to the urban.

1591
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:07,560
But especially, yeah, the last 10, 20 years,

1592
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,160
I guess we see an increasing interest

1593
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,560
also in other senses and the urban.

1594
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:13,160
The example, I briefly want to discuss

1595
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,920
which you today as a closure for the lecture,

1596
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:19,280
isn't it this research and auditory sonic cultures

1597
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,880
to vocabulary tends to differ?

1598
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,320
There is a lot of interesting work being done on this still,

1599
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:28,140
sometimes also by practicing artists,

1600
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:30,440
practicing musicians that also write,

1601
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,600
such as for example, Brandon Labell,

1602
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:35,280
who were quite a nice book on acoustic territories,

1603
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,760
sound culture, and everyday lives.

1604
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,920
So you see again, everyday life returning

1605
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,880
as vocabulary.

1606
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,540
So in chapter three, for example,

1607
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:47,380
which is some of the examples I use here,

1608
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:49,020
where you explicitly build some

1609
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:51,460
of the subtodes to practice a very alive,

1610
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:54,060
and where we develop the view on walking,

1611
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:57,020
not an individual way, as actually just had told

1612
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:58,980
because he had a lot of discussions as a tool

1613
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:00,740
about how you look in relation to building,

1614
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:03,420
how you position yourself in relation to the city,

1615
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,220
but where we develop the view in walking through

1616
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:08,420
an auditory or rhythmic perspectives.

1617
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:10,100
And then it gives all kinds of examples,

1618
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,860
such as crosswalk signals, warning alarms,

1619
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:17,660
or personal audio, so listening on your smartphone to music while walking through the city,

1620
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:21,360
but also for example sound art or marching bands or protest,

1621
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:28,660
and a role sound place in let's say experiencing and structuring, let's say city life.

1622
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:35,160
It gives the example, for example, of Floriano Humano, Philante Sao Paulo.

1623
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:38,960
I think he actually mentions his Rio de Janeiro, but I think it's in Sao Paulo.

1624
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:45,160
We walked around with a big speaker on his back,

1625
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:50,800
which basically with a voice, speaking on loud,

1626
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,880
something like don't pay attention to them

1627
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,240
if I remember correctly.

1628
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:56,680
So we're walking around the streets in public space,

1629
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:00,080
don't pay attention, don't pay attention,

1630
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:03,080
which obviously the exact opposite will then happen,

1631
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:06,640
which is a pretty nice or neat intervention,

1632
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:12,360
I think in public space as a kind of art project.

1633
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:15,920
Another example is that we have an active network.

1634
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,000
And this is a much longer history, also, of field

1635
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:18,520
records.

1636
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,520
People doing field recordings.

1637
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,280
There's a very nice website for those

1638
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:26,760
that are into this stuff, which is called Sound Cities.

1639
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:30,360
Just Google it, you'll find it, which has collected, let's say,

1640
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:33,160
field records from cities across the world,

1641
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,560
a way you can actually play-- well, it's

1642
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,320
that the maps literally on the map of these cities

1643
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,400
are where you can play, let's say,

1644
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,480
sounds from these cities or from these particular locations

1645
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:42,680
in these cities.

1646
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:43,640
And that's the lesson,

1647
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:44,920
ever growing database,

1648
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:48,280
but there's also active community of sound recording,

1649
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:51,000
field records, recording sounds or cities.

1650
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,240
And it's quite nice if you have a bit of time

1651
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,400
to, let's say, to go through some of the sounds

1652
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,000
and also experience some of the, let's say,

1653
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,440
differences in sounds are between, between different cities.

1654
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:08,440
One example I want to just briefly play and I hope there's all the works with sounds.

1655
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:11,440
I'm just going to play it and then you're going to have to tell me if you hear the sounds.

1656
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,440
Turn on do turn on the sounds.

1657
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:18,000
It's a very nice piece I think by Finn's Bloom and Mexican artist, Simba Fova-Sun

1658
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:28,800
novel from Mexico City 2015, where we basically manipulated the walking signals of on the street

1659
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:36,080
in Mexico City, and where we replaced the sound of a pedestrian traffic light with the

1660
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:41,440
like, that's a classic sound, with the sound of a donkey, which according to him is a nice

1661
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:46,880
way of well, paying attention to well. First of all, making people think differently or

1662
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:50,400
look differently, right, this is something else than I expected, so it's a kind of intervention,

1663
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:55,600
but also attracting attention to an animal which has largely disappeared from Mexico City,

1664
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:02,320
Cizzies urban space which was different last say 30, 40, 50 years ago.

1665
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:06,080
So I'm just going to look at this works and you're going to have to tell me just do it like this

1666
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,560
or something if the sound is okay.

1667
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:21,040
Do your sounds? Okay perfect, no, just kidding.

1668
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,440
Good job, Good job.

1669
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:33,440
[SOUND]

1670
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:43,440
[MUSIC]

1671
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,700
(screaming)

1672
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,700
(music)

1673
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:54,700
[Music]

1674
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:56,700
(singing)

1675
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:59,700
(crowd chattering)

1676
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:27,700
(music)

1677
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:38,900
Okay, so just one small example which I thought is a pretty nice intervention with a lot

1678
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:39,900
of humor.

1679
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:43,820
Fili's bloom also did quite, he's done a lot of work as a sound artist, he also did quite

1680
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:48,100
some interesting work and this is kind of early work if you'd argue.

1681
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:53,820
But where later on he actually worked in collaboration with blind people to actually and

1682
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:58,100
let's say sounds and their experience of urban space in order to sort of make

1683
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:02,500
artistic well artistic projects which is also some interesting work to just

1684
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:06,660
check this website if you're interested in this kind of stuff.

1685
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:12,260
This example I'll move to the very end which is a nice example by the way of

1686
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:18,100
sound and protest and there are many examples of this following the 2011

1687
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:21,780
Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.

1688
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:29,540
Japan's are actually a wide range of public protests. Here is one example which was a sound demo

1689
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:36,980
organized by Elus Association called Shiroto Noan, amateur revolt, and the organ as a kind of sound

1690
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:42,340
demo protest, which is pretty neat if you like noise, which I do. But since it's a 10 minute video,

1691
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:50,260
I will leave this for the very end and close my... Sorry, that one will come in a second.

1692
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:54,060
and move to my conclusions.

1693
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:56,300
Before I do so, are there any questions

1694
01:47:56,300 --> 01:48:00,580
on the section on the sensory organism?

1695
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:07,220
And I know it's almost 8 p.m. so I know it's late.

1696
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:10,420
Yeah, just unmute yourself and start talking

1697
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:12,660
because I don't see anyone in my screen.

1698
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:16,260
- Okay, I would just like to share with you

1699
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:18,420
and with me, can be interested

1700
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:22,400
and the project of Sandoff tourism.

1701
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,460
- Oh, that's Mico Sanchez in Lisbon.

1702
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:28,700
He might be the sound of tourism in the city

1703
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,700
and it's pretty interesting to his staff.

1704
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,020
- Thanks, thanks a lot.

1705
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:34,620
I don't know, Jia, so I'll check it out.

1706
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:35,900
Very cool, yeah.

1707
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:36,740
Okay, thanks.

1708
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:41,620
Are there comments, suggestions, interventions?

1709
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:43,500
Nope.

1710
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,620
I will wrap up the new conclusions

1711
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,220
and then after the conclusions,

1712
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:51,140
I will move to the Tokyo video,

1713
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:52,980
but there's obviously no obligation to sit

1714
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:54,340
through 12 minutes of noise,

1715
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:57,700
so I just leave it playing for those that are interested,

1716
01:48:57,700 --> 01:49:02,220
but I will conclude and say bye after the conclusions.

1717
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:06,740
Okay, to wrap up this relatively intense session,

1718
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:08,900
I think around the different strands of research

1719
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:12,700
on urban culture, what I try to get across

1720
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:15,700
is that research and urban cultures is a thriving

1721
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:17,100
and more perhaps more importantly,

1722
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:18,700
or equally important,

1723
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:21,220
an inter-transdisciplinary field of research.

1724
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:23,120
It's increasingly difficult to distinguish

1725
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:26,420
between disciplines in research and urban cultures,

1726
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:30,180
which perhaps is a trend that applies to all teams,

1727
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:31,080
you could say,

1728
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:32,340
but it definitely thing it applies

1729
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:35,220
most strongly to research and urban culture.

1730
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:38,780
Building on 1980s, '99 is the bait on the cultural term,

1731
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:42,140
postmodernism and urban and the symbolic economy,

1732
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:43,860
and to interaction with urban and topology

1733
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:44,940
and cultural studies,

1734
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:47,240
particularly to notion studies inform informality

1735
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:49,240
and formal urbanist in every life.

1736
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,600
What we see is that urban studies is really diversified

1737
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,240
into multiple strands of research

1738
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:55,720
dedicated to cultural issues.

1739
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,320
It's important to make distinctions here

1740
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:59,920
because different strands have different artists,

1741
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,040
have different communities of practice.

1742
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,240
But I would say there are three different strands

1743
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:08,480
that are most interesting, but they really might do cover,

1744
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:09,720
and they're not the only strands,

1745
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:14,280
but I do think they cover, let's say 80% of the urban studies

1746
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:19,320
research on urban culture, perhaps with the exception of urban tourism and cultural issues,

1747
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,840
which I didn't discuss in detail today.

1748
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:26,560
The first one being the arts, activism and urban engagement, the second cultural infrastructure

1749
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:33,440
to inform urbanism and the third strength around sensory urbanism, a very brief, two examples

1750
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:36,520
on visual cultures and sounds.

1751
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:39,920
That's it from my side for today.

1752
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:46,560
there are no further questions that I will move back to the to this presentation.

1753
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:53,280
Sorry to this video. I have one quick question. I have one question. I have any connections

1754
01:50:53,280 --> 01:51:03,520
between Sanzuri Urbanism and Clubing Culture for instance. Limited, limited. I think it's in the

1755
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:08,560
research is limited. I think the Clubing Culture literature as far as I know is largely

1756
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,080
your literature that builds on the elastic

1757
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,400
classic cultural studies tradition,

1758
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,040
focusing on, let's say, youth culture,

1759
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:18,840
popular culture, sociological approaches, by and large.

1760
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,840
However, it's, if you look at, let's say,

1761
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,480
practitioners in club and culture,

1762
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,400
then I think there are stronger connections,

1763
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,720
especially those working in, let's say,

1764
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:31,400
electronic music, moving, let's say,

1765
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,000
from a minimal techno orientation

1766
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,640
who have increasingly moved into, let's say,

1767
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:41,200
modern composition and/or indeed fieldwork type, fields with

1768
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:50,400
course, type of work. There you will see artists who, well, sort of transcend

1769
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,920
boundaries who connect these things because they then become, you could say,

1770
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,600
sensory urbanists through their practice. But in the research I would say,

1771
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:01,520
less so, they seem to be quite separate. Well, they are to a lot of

1772
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:05,120
stand-quite separate fields. But which doesn't mean that

1773
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:08,120
could actually cannot be made so that maybe then your job.

1774
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:16,520
Well, I'm thinking, I have one example in mind of the

1775
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:21,820
Tbilisi in Georgia where last year there were very big

1776
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:24,720
protests, I have to say, I really don't know the details about it,

1777
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:32,420
but I know there was also some substantial mobilization from clubs

1778
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:38,420
and from people, from artists and people from that scene.

1779
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:46,420
And you saw some sort of collaboration between these people from

1780
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:52,180
top coaches, to say, and more political movements and also using music in public space as a form

1781
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:57,860
of protest. Yeah, that happens, of course. I think in the Berlin example I used before,

1782
01:52:57,860 --> 01:53:02,500
I think you also see these examples of public protest and music.

1783
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:05,780
I mean, the classic example of the love parade started.

1784
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:08,020
How would you could say as a political movement,

1785
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:13,620
even though I would argue it was heavily commodified soon after or increasingly so.

1786
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:18,900
But the century urbanism literature perhaps relates more to the experimental

1787
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:22,100
sides and to the sound, not even necessarily music.

1788
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:24,260
And that's the different kind of scene, are you?

1789
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:32,900
although there is overlap obviously. So yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Any other comments, questions?

1790
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:39,700
Perhaps just a very practical question from me regarding the seminars that will follow in the coming

1791
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:48,420
weeks. Yes. And I wonder how the presentations will go. I asked because we were asked in the past

1792
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:52,980
to record the video of our presentation and I wondered if you wanted the same or if we will give

1793
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:56,340
that in person. Yes, the rule would be what remained the same. I think that's how it was

1794
01:53:56,340 --> 01:54:00,340
communicated also. So I would actually need to look into the details myself because I've been busy

1795
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:09,060
with the lectures so far. But the idea would still be that the recordings are recorded in advance,

1796
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:14,020
and then we have the... and you was evil to me or you... and I'm represented. Yes.

1797
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,020
Right, thanks.

1798
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:18,020
So I'm sorry.

1799
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:19,020
Sorry.

1800
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,020
Okay.

1801
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:21,020
Yeah.

1802
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:22,020
Okay.

1803
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:24,420
That will move to the presentation, but it's 8 p.m.

1804
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:32,020
So this is just when I say the hardcore survivors who want to stick around for a bit longer.

1805
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:33,620
I'm going to say goodbye in any case.

1806
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:36,220
I will also look at it again.

1807
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:38,860
So you can still chat if you want to.

1808
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:40,820
And then thank you for your attention.

1809
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:46,820
And I will see, well, I think everyone of you next week during the seminar.

1810

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,620
please feel free to,

65
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,260
or yeah, please tell us or tell me in the chat,

66
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,700
which I have opened here just in case.

67
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,140
Welcome, all of you.

68
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,580
I'm sure that you've had that so many times already.

69
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,100
I really wish we could meet face to face

70
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,740
in an actual lecture room at the UB.

71
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,540
But I'm still happy that we are doing it in any case.

72
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,660
And it's very unusual.

73
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,340
Or maybe for you actually already a very normal format by now.

74
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,100
Who am I?

75
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,460
You might be wondering, my name is Voichi Kumbowski.

76
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,500
I am a postdoctoral researcher here at VUB.

77
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,580
And I'm the last of the four white males

78
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,220
to tell you everything about urban geography.

79
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,100
So I come last, but I hope this was not

80
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,900
being a very tiring cause by now and you still have the energy and then will to to follow.

81
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:17,780
Over the course of the next two lectures, two sessions, I'll be sharing with you my perspective,

82
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:26,100
my ideas about urban transport and mobility. Well, it's a lecture, so it's very difficult to make it

83
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:33,060
highly interactive, but I will still try to ask you some questions and I think I hope it's

84
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,060
It's possible for you to try to respond to them not only through chapter basically, you know,

85
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,900
turn the audio on video and I don't think it will be a conversation but at least it will

86
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,180
be nice to hear some other voices, not only mindful two hours and then two hours again.

87
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,740
And of course this is followed by a discussion seminar.

88
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,580
So you will have read or you have read or you have read or you have read or you have

89
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,980
read some articles and I hope you will have a discussion there so that we can make this

90
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,620
is holding a little bit more interactive than it is usually

91
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,020
the case on these online courses.

92
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,420
Right.

93
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,620
I hope you can also see the slides.

94
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,540
Can you not those of you who have the video on?

95
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,180
Do you see them?

96
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,780
Perfect.

97
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,340
Very good.

98
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,340
So excellent.

99
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,020
So urban transport and mobility, it is.

100
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,500
If you have any questions concerning the content,

101
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,300
or I don't know, the quality of video audio,

102
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,340
let me know in the chat.

103
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,340
I'll try to read this as I talk, multitasking

104
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,340
and try to interrupt me if you have any questions.

105
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,620
If you disagree, if you have some burning issue,

106
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,260
let me know and I'll let ask now

107
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,340
and then I'll try to stop and address that.

108
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,940
All right, great.

109
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,780
So what is the plan for the next two sessions?

110
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,780
Today we're going to talk about a historical hegemony

111
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,020
to different main sets of approaches to urban geography

112
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,100
of transport.

113
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,340
And next week, we're going to try to deconstruct all that

114
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,860
to address this in a critical manner

115
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,340
and to understand how to look at urban transport

116
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,780
and mobility from a critical set of perspectives.

117
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,980
So without further ado, today we're going to start

118
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,380
with a bit of a historical overview of the relationship

119
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,700
between transport and the city,

120
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,060
how this relationship evolved in at least two directions,

121
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,980
and discuss as much as possible,

122
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,940
as much as time will allow us to.

123
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,740
This historical hegemony of two main sets of approaches

124
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,180
on urban transport and geography.

125
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,620
So the classical and sustainable perspectives

126
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,660
of urban transport.

127
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,100
But before we begin,

128
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,300
I'm really curious about what your expectations might be.

129
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,300
I imagine that a lot of you in, you know,

130
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,140
starting a course of urban studies or geography

131
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,020
didn't really expect to study transport.

132
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,060
Why would the transport be important

133
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,980
for understanding cities in the geography?

134
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,300
What do you think?

135
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,300
Would anybody like to say something

136
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,420
or type it in the chat?

137
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
That's the moment.

138
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,460
We're gonna have a few of these open questions

139
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,020
throughout these four hours together.

140
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,380
Why study transport when studying cities?

141
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,620
Why is that important or not?

142
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,140
- I did actually expect transport to be part

143
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,620
the study because to me at least it alters the way the city is structured, sometimes it's

144
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,140
structured around a specific mode of transport. There's differences between

145
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:40,700
they call like Harvard cities or cities more in the middle of land something and I think it

146
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:47,500
makes a big difference with how with a geographic air development. So to me it's actually, I think

147
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,900
I think it's a key factor.

148
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,500
- Right, so we would have some impact on the urban form

149
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,740
on, I'd say, the spatial arrangement of the city.

150
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,980
Why else, there are many reasons as you can imagine,

151
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,340
but what comes to your mind?

152
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:07,060
- I think it also like Matilda already mentioned before,

153
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,940
one main aspect is sustainability and cities

154
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,940
how to reach the climate goals.

155
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,940
So, it's linked to different transportation systems.

156
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:31,940
So, to think of, let's say, environmental impact of cities and transport being the big part of that.

157
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,940
Possibly, or being part of the problem, right?

158
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,540
So generating emissions, CO2 and other gases that contribute to the climate crisis.

159
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,820
All right. What else?

160
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,860
I think something has to do with JAPOP PUNTURITIES.

161
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,380
JAPOP PUNTURITIES.

162
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,700
For example, in Lagos in Nigeria, we see people moving for hours

163
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,740
to look for a job and go back again. So eight hours, they're spending in

164
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,860
in causal.

165
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,180
- Right, right.

166
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,820
- So transport is, well,

167
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
without transport is difficult to get around the city

168
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,900
and use its different functions

169
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,060
and use different opportunities

170
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,980
that the city might provide,

171
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,620
like employment, education, leisure,

172
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,780
many other things.

173
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,620
All right.

174
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,860
Any last points before you move on?

175
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,540
Does somebody have a great idea

176
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,340
to add this little discussion?

177
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,940
Well, okay.

178
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,940
Well, I think today, yes, it's quite,

179
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,580
actually, is this slide a little bit cut

180
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,420
or do you see it?

181
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,940
Yeah, I think this will be better now.

182
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,020
So today when you open the news,

183
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,660
I think it's difficult to not to notice

184
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,180
the transport is, well, very present, I would say,

185
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,980
in the public debate.

186
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,420
Last year, I'm just taking a few examples here.

187
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,940
last year, you probably read about, and maybe even participated in a witness, huge

188
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:13,140
protests that erupted in Chile, starting in the capital of the country, which of course

189
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:19,340
very much addressed fundamental structural issues in terms of how capitalism develops

190
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,700
in this country and how it has its urban or spatial impact.

191
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,820
But the beginning of the protests was so that the final even dropped that actually led

192
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,820
to the option of those strice and these operations

193
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,620
was the increase of public transport first,

194
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,820
and specifically the underground phase.

195
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,180
In Brussels, that's the top right corner.

196
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,740
We've, in the past years,

197
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,060
we witnessed a series of protests in public space

198
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,460
that address the increased presence of the car,

199
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,100
which supposedly these protests claim takes space

200
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,460
from the people, so it'll decrease the quality

201
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,620
of a new life.

202
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,780
negatively impact the quality of living, health conditions,

203
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,980
especially of children.

204
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,980
And then the figure on the top left,

205
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,020
I'm sure that you all know Greta, who

206
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,140
refers to transport, of course, she doesn't talk only

207
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,580
but transport, but she does.

208
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,780
And she makes this very political statement

209
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,220
of not traveling by plane and using one of the trains

210
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,540
to go to her meetings or conferences, at least before,

211
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,860
COVID she did, the idea there is to show us

212
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,260
that there is a necessity for us to engage

213
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,740
in some social and environmental transition

214
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,300
and transport is part of this transition.

215
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,900
So the way that we've moved around,

216
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,260
the way that we've lived,

217
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,140
is essentially unsustainable,

218
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,420
it's detrimental from the environmental point of view.

219
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,500
We need to change that radically, meaning

220
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,580
in a very drastic way.

221
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,740
So really, in a very profound way,

222
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,980
it also in terms of speed of that change in order to address what shared and devices

223
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,300
the main issue today and main problem today which is the climate crisis of the climate catastrophe

224
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,380
that is imminent. It's I think easy to yeah just by following the news to realize that well

225
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,500
something is profoundly wrong with with the way that we are mobile today and that has to change

226
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,620
and indeed the industry or the those whether the key actors in terms of producing transport

227
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,940
is there to, of course, respond with some solutions at least.

228
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,500
So we're being told that at least one of the solutions,

229
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,220
or one of the series of solutions that are available,

230
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,140
are those of platform-based economies of shared digitalised, smart,

231
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,820
gig economy-related mobility or mobility.

232
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,180
So for instance, in the future, living in the city,

233
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,380
we don't have to have a car.

234
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,860
It says, you know, the tremendous demand,

235
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,780
we can rent one through an app.

236
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,140
We can drive electric cars which are readily available in public space in our cities. We can use one of these

237
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,500
electric scooters and many other modes of transport that have

238
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,740
boomed in recent years in many many cities of the global north especially but also in global south.

239
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,100
And Brussels, I'm sure those of you who are from the city of

240
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,380
being there for a couple of months now. You know you can observe many of these different

241
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,020
practices of mobility, very present in the city, and some of them at least being part of a

242
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:24,260
narrative of some change, of some future, of something that is shaping the way that we live and move

243
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,940
around the city. From a more scientific perspective, one answer why to the question why is that

244
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:38,100
the transport? Is that quite simply? And I think actually the very first sentence of one of the most

245
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,660
seminal textbooks on transcription of transport geography.

246
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,780
There wouldn't be no transportation without geography,

247
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,940
and there would be no transportation,

248
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,740
no trajectory without transportation.

249
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,620
Transport of transportation in North America

250
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,180
is an essential geographical issue.

251
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,220
The idea is, and again, it's the same textbook,

252
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,860
that transport allows to reduce the distance to zero, of course.

253
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,860
That reduction never really happens, but the idea is

254
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,940
the transport allows to annihilate space and time

255
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,340
that is required to conquer, to cover that space.

256
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,620
But I think beyond that very dry definition

257
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,260
of the relationship between the two,

258
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,820
what's quite important is that, well,

259
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,460
it's very hard to imagine not only contemporary,

260
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,340
but also pre-modern ancient societies without movement

261
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,060
without transport.

262
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,060
It's something that has always been fundamental

263
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,980
for human societies for human settlements.

264
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,980
And today, and that's something that I will try

265
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,940
to show you in these two lectures

266
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,380
and in the discussion that will follow the week after.

267
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,060
Transport is absolutely fundamental for studying the city.

268
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,940
And I think it's a fascinating entry

269
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
for studying what cities are today,

270
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,980
what problems might be found in the not only

271
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,780
transport problems, but social problems,

272
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,940
spatial problems, economic problems related

273
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,860
to all different challenges that at first,

274
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,700
at least do not seem to be transport related.

275
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,660
So in fact, they are being negotiated, articulated,

276
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,620
contested, solved sometimes, but more often

277
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,260
unfortunately created through the production

278
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,780
and distribution of transport.

279
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,980
So we will try to impact this relationship

280
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,740
starting by, let's say,

281
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,500
more of a historical analysis.

282
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,460
So I'll start in mid-19th century

283
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,540
in Sootheesen, Western Europe

284
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,740
in what we can identify and pre-industrial era.

285
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,740
And we will bring that analysis to the 1960s, 1970s.

286
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,700
Let's see how much time we've got for this today too.

287
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,100
Well, let's say the beginning of a major crisis

288
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,340
that formed or framed the debate in a way

289
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,740
that it is being framed still today.

290
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,700
So some kind of a setting of a contemporary challenge

291
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,180
or series of contemporary challenges related

292
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,460
to transport and mobility.

293
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,660
So all right.

294
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,860
So the main point here--

295
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,380
I don't want to spend too much time on this historical part

296
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,420
because I don't think this is the, well,

297
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,180
it's not contemporary, so perhaps it's not as interesting

298
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,300
as as many challenges that are happening right now.

299
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,820
The main point here is that urban transport systems

300
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,260
are a very strong and strictly related

301
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,980
with urban form and with a spatial structure.

302
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,660
So the development of cities is conditioned

303
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,140
by the development of what we call transport modes

304
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,620
from walking, so just walking on foot,

305
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,820
to the bicycle, the public transport, and to the car.

306
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,340
And there is a persistently strong relationship

307
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,540
between the intra-urban transportation system

308
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,140
and the organization of the metropolis

309
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,900
as Miller, who wrote one of the most seminal,

310
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,500
again, textbooks on the history of transport geography,

311
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,340
tells us.

312
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,940
And there is a variety of different urban forms

313
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,020
and spatial structures and land use patterns

314
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,020
which are related specifically or very closely

315
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,260
to the development of different transport norms.

316
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:05,980
And as far as I understand, you've covered quite a few of the most important models of development,

317
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,180
urban development throughout history with Nick.

318
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:15,740
You can not hear if that's the case and deny the fact if you didn't.

319
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,260
But I think that this was covered at some point.

320
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,980
And the idea here is that in a lot of these models, although not explicitly mentioned,

321
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,860
transport was actually absolutely crucial.

322
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,660
So the idea was both the adjacent unknowns and movement

323
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,100
and mills mentioned that without the development

324
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,300
of different voices moving around the city,

325
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,620
the development of which of course to an extent

326
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,020
erroneously they tried to model or predict

327
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,340
would not be able to happen.

328
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:48,820
Well, the debate has been there in the

329
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,780
in transport geography until the 1970s, 1980s,

330
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,740
how to model that relationship, how to analyze it,

331
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,740
whether in fact it's more the development of a decision

332
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,460
that drives the development of transport

333
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,260
or the other around with its development

334
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,780
of different transport modes,

335
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,940
that drive the development of the city.

336
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,580
It's not a particularly interesting debate today,

337
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,980
but it's important to acknowledge that geographers

338
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,620
were very early on,

339
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,540
urban geographers interested in the development of mobility.

340
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,940
One, also rather imperfect and symbolic rather than

341
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,300
analytical way of describing this is through identifying

342
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,460
some cycles of innovation.

343
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,340
So looking at different scientific developments

344
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,540
come-- well, some scientists would say

345
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,980
in these kind of crucial moments.

346
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,220
There's a bundle of different innovations coming together.

347
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,060
So at the end of the 18th century, as you can see at the left

348
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,180
inside of the graph, the invention of water power textiles

349
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,540
iron than some 60, 70 years later,

350
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,420
the steam engine rail, production of steel,

351
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,540
et cetera, et cetera.

352
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,220
Each of these bundle of innovations

353
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,260
allowing to, of course, create a more efficient

354
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,300
that you can be faster and more energy efficient

355
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,260
way of moving, of course, not only within,

356
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,100
but also between cities, changing not only the way

357
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,100
that people move, but also the way that the city itself

358
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,020
could be organized in space.

359
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,940
And in this sense, we could,

360
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,620
although of course this is not a perfect robust typology,

361
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,180
but we could come into some kind of agreement.

362
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,260
You don't have to accept it,

363
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,820
and I'm happy if you erase some issues with it.

364
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,060
But we could divide the development of the city

365
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,540
around the development of transport

366
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,220
by identifying four different stages,

367
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,260
I wouldn't call them errors,

368
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,540
but a city that is a pre-industrial city

369
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,220
that largely was based on walking,

370
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,220
since more motorized transport was generally speaking,

371
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,020
not that it was just not there

372
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,060
and having a horse would be an extremely expensive

373
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,220
investment, which means people walked.

374
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,220
And industrial city, which developed around the birth

375
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,740
of what we could identify today as public transport,

376
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,540
first horse driven carts and then motorized ones,

377
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,300
Then the Ford is city which very much developed around the,

378
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,700
not only in the invention, but rather the

379
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,980
classification and the finalization of private vehicles

380
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,980
and private cars.

381
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,960
And then a city of today, the post-F

382
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,540
is city which very much fails on the development of

383
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,460
transport modes that use the ICT information

384
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,340
and information and communication technologies.

385
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,380
And of course aviation, so the city does,

386
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,500
is very much related also to the development of all

387
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:47,780
typology of spaces related to flying to airplanes, both passenger and cargo transport.

388
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:54,740
Are there any questions at this stage before we dive into these different four stages?

389
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,020
I don't hear anything. Yeah, yeah. How to go ahead.

390
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:08,100
The draw we see is linked to a conradive because we saw something like this.

391
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,260
with lessons of Nick?

392
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
- Yeah, I would say so.

393
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,500
I think that it's one of the ways of,

394
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,060
I wouldn't say that it's specific,

395
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,300
yeah, that it's completely matches conductance ways,

396
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,060
but the idea is the same,

397
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,300
that there is some kind of development of innovation

398
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,060
within the capitalist system,

399
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,180
which allows to gain some competitive advantage

400
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,700
which allows to create some kind of growth machine,

401
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,620
and then is competitive advantage over time

402
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,660
is lost so that we have to decline until it picks up again.

403
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,060
What I think with contract is still not clear is whether this new wave,

404
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,460
so the one that here in this graph happens after the 1990s, it's very clear.

405
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,980
So as far as I understand, although I'm not especially here,

406
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,900
there is a discussion whether this new wave is with the digitalization

407
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,860
and software engineering is actually materializing,

408
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,740
or whether we've arrived at a global system,

409
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:11,780
which there is no growth of, at least within industrial production,

410
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,820
but it's rather a financial, financialized growth.

411
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:20,500
But it's a good, let's say it's a good hand,

412
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,380
it's the idea is more or less the same, the same intuition.

413
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:29,300
Also, the problem with this clearly is that it's not, I mean,

414
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,180
this kind of way of trying to understand what happened in cities around transport in the past,

415
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,220
two centuries is extremely Western focused or very Eurocentric.

416
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:47,780
So this would not be a story of cities in most of Latin America, Africa, and South Asia,

417
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:55,140
and also post-Soviet or Soviet world. So the global south and the global east, as it's

418
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:02,020
sometimes even called today, it's not really part of this story that is told by this graph.

419
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:09,700
We will try to address this, but it's, yeah, it's, that will happen at the very end of the last

420
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,420
of the last session to try to decolonize a little bit our knowledge about transport geography

421
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,180
because it's extremely westernized and extremely for a Eurocentric.

422
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,140
Right, let's dive into that.

423
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,820
Right, so the pre-industrial city, right?

424
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:32,580
Well, I guess it's quite self explanatory. It's not very difficult to understand.

425
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,860
And indeed, the idea is that the city basically is, well,

426
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,940
since there is no motorized transport modes

427
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,540
and having, as I mentioned, having a horse or a horse car,

428
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,540
it's a cost of fortune.

429
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:50,340
It's an absolutely luxurious good, pretty much everybody

430
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,780
walks.

431
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,940
And since everybody walks, the city cannot be too big for people

432
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:01,740
to cross it on foot within more than 20, 30, maybe 40 minutes.

433
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,260
So a traditional global northern European city would have,

434
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,300
until, let's say, end of the 18th century,

435
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,500
no more than five kilometers in diameter.

436
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,300
That would mean, of course, here, for example,

437
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,500
you have the map of Brussels from that time.

438
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,380
That would mean that within the city walls,

439
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,220
which existed for military purposes, for defense,

440
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,780
there had to be a very high density

441
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,220
of different functions of different users.

442
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,820
And for other reasons that we know how to dive into today,

443
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,060
a grid street pattern was also very common

444
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,860
from middle ages onwards.

445
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,220
Also very importantly, since these, well,

446
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,500
not maybe since, but as these different functions

447
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,220
were mixed, maybe this mixity was allowed partially

448
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,580
also because of the fact that the division between work

449
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,540
at home, a division that is absolutely fundamental

450
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,620
for a lot of writing on transport geography

451
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,860
that focuses on that morning and evening commute

452
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,060
from home to work and work from home.

453
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,100
That did not exist.

454
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,260
Most people worked from home.

455
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,740
Most people did not have to move to reach.

456
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,420
We can say they implement the employment

457
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,620
that they had or to engage in some kind of productive activity

458
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,620
that would be remunerated to gain some kind of salary

459
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,460
or profit.

460
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,820
Things-- and this is all Brussels first.

461
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,820
Brussels, the map of it, and then a view of the city center where you obviously, well,

462
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:38,460
you basically see a lot of pedestrians and not much else in terms of mobility modes.

463
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,960
This began to change with a series of inventions. First, a steam engine, an electric engine,

464
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,100
both, well, the invention started at the end of 18th century and moved also to the 19th

465
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,900
century, then the bicycle, I'm moving very fast in time,

466
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,900
and the bicycle was invented in the '60s of the 19th century.

467
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,780
I think, 1867 more or less.

468
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,260
Of course, all these inventions first

469
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,740
being curiosity, again, very luxurious goods,

470
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,340
bicycle being something that was much more used first

471
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,020
as a form of pleasure before eventually becoming

472
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,100
a mode of transport for many workers.

473
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,340
although it meant is that they gradually led to mechanization

474
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,660
of land transport systems.

475
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:34,460
And we see that gradually happening here.

476
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,540
So these different inventions,

477
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,820
particularly steam engine and nature also,

478
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,900
the discovery and discovery of the machines

479
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,260
that allow to produce electricity meant that

480
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,800
towards the end of the 19th century,

481
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,140
it appears a completely different mode of transport,

482
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,740
which revolutionizes cities of the time,

483
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,740
which is that of first a host around streetcar

484
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,020
and an electric streetcar,

485
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,180
which started to be introduced in European,

486
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,420
Western European cities, around 1890s,

487
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,340
and then became extremely popular by the 1920s.

488
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,940
That led to, well, we moved to this second state,

489
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,580
let's say, to the industrial city,

490
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:23,700
Let's do a huge revolution of how cities could be conquered by its inhabitants,

491
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,940
how they could be managed, navigated by its inhabitants.

492
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:37,100
That also allowed, or led to the decision to engage in construction of a number of underground

493
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,060
tramways, as they went for a school, the land of the ground systems first,

494
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:46,540
in London in Asia, early as 1863, then Budapest in 1896,

495
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,340
and the first Northern American system in Boston in 1897.

496
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,180
And that marked the beginning of, as I said,

497
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,740
a revolutionary change in a golden era

498
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,340
of the development of railway transport systems.

499
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,180
As railway networks expanded tremendously

500
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,740
and became the dominant land transport

501
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,940
for both passengers and for freight.

502
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,620
And that was valid or is valid

503
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,580
for both interurban and intraurban transport.

504
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,620
Why was this invention revolutionary?

505
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,520
Well, of course, because increased speed

506
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,300
allowed to cover increased distance.

507
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,400
So suddenly, for instance, the idea of still living

508
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,700
within the very medieval perimeter of the city

509
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,460
was or started to be questioned.

510
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,900
It's the idea of expanding the city to the suburb

511
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,060
or connecting the villages and the suburbs

512
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,060
to the city proper began to make a lot of sense.

513
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:45,540
So that led was one at least one of the ideas

514
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,300
why in a number of cities across Europe,

515
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,220
city walls were demolished.

516
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,100
And we see that here in Brussels.

517
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,500
So first, horse, drone, cart.

518
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,140
I think it's a photograph from the 1890s.

519
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,340
So end of the 19th century and 1910,

520
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,900
I think it's a green whale in Brussels, you already see.

521
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:13,100
I think that's, is that a horse, really in trumbly.

522
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,780
I think it actually is already, it's an electric one,

523
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,900
although I don't see the cables.

524
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,100
I thought it was an electric, but I think it might still be

525
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,260
pulled by a horse, although you don't see that from,

526
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,500
well, the trander is heading in our direction,

527
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,780
does not have a horse pulling it.

528
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,820
Right.

529
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,980
So I already mentioned this in a little bit.

530
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,980
So a revolution in urban travel, a breaking mode

531
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,260
that allowed to rethink the air reform,

532
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,060
made an impact on it in a great way.

533
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,940
Breaking this idea of a compact, dense,

534
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,820
medieval city, allowing to extend what was considered

535
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,220
to be a city to up to 20 or 30 kilometers in time,

536
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,100
if you think that the previous,

537
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,260
let's say model of a city had up to five,

538
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,260
This was an expansion of four to six times.

539
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,300
But also a PS in this process.

540
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,060
Of course, it's not all related to transport,

541
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,580
but it's happening more or less the same time.

542
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,540
And it makes a big impact on what transport is

543
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,620
in the city and what it role is,

544
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,740
is that this expansion of the urban form in space

545
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,300
allows for some specialisation of different functions,

546
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,900
especially economic functions.

547
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,980
And what it also creates,

548
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,740
or contributes to the creation of,

549
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,380
is the creation of a working class,

550
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,300
the Office of a specific group,

551
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,940
a social group of course, very diverse internally,

552
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,620
but a group that sells its time for a living,

553
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,700
that of course with the industrial revolution,

554
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,500
does that not in any more at home,

555
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,380
but actually starts what we start coming,

556
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,460
commuting to its workplace,

557
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,580
where things have been produced

558
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:07,860
the profit is being made and where the salary work is exchanged for money for a salary.

559
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:15,460
That separation, as I mentioned, being absolutely fundamental for decades of analysis of transport

560
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:23,460
to come. So, focus on this commute from work to home and vice versa. Moving to the next,

561
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:30,260
something, good to see you. Moving to the next stage of urban development, you can put it

562
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:37,060
very roughly. Of course a fundamental invention of the car, not only the invention of the car

563
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:44,660
proper because the vehicle itself, I mean we can go back to the first diesel engine invented

564
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,860
in the 90s of the 19th century, pheumatic tyre, four stroke engine, and a few years later,

565
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:55,460
and that led to the construction of the first automobile, as they were called back then in the

566
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,500
in the 1890s, but it was fundamentally the

567
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,140
classification of the current invention of this particular model,

568
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,020
which I'm sure you've--

569
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,980
or a lot of you probably have heard about already--

570
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,740
the model T by Ford, which began to be produced in 1913.

571
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,300
And famously, Mr. Ford said that this model is available

572
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,060
in any color as long as it is black.

573
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,700
The idea being that with unification of--

574
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:31,780
universalization of the model, getting rid of any options of any customization of any personalization.

575
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:42,020
And also, the implementation of today is being called Taylorism. So reaching a near automated

576
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:47,220
way of producing this vehicle with very strictly measured time for every single activity that

577
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,020
that was part of the production process.

578
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,020
The final price of the production and the final price for the consumer

579
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,860
could be reduced as much as possible,

580
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,820
meaning that this product, this commodity,

581
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,300
could be available to white masses.

582
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,140
And that does begin from the 1910s already,

583
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,780
but especially from the 1930s, when indeed the price started going

584
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,060
significantly down, the era of the automobile,

585
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,580
the era of a mode which I'm sure that if you

586
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,980
know, turn on the news about Brussels or any other Western European North American city,

587
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:29,140
but that debate also is very, very present in Minneapolis, Latin America and South Asian

588
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,740
cities. It's a mode that is very much on the agenda whenever you talk about, whenever

589
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:41,740
you hear about transport. And we're going to talk about that, I guess, tonight, if not,

590
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:47,240
in a week is a very well, is a very present mode of transport in our cities and also very

591
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:53,120
problematic mode of transport in the tracks, a lot of constipation, a lot of anger, and

592
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:59,280
a lot of creative and critical thinking in terms of what's the alternative to the automobile.

593
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,620
So it's been almost a century now that our cities, if we think about it from the global

594
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:10,860
north, are, I don't know, benefiting or suffering from that, from that long, you tell me.

595
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:17,320
from 1913 to 1927 Ford managed to build 15 million units, 15 million

596
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,340
vehicles, making it the second most produced current history right after

597
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,580
Volkswagen Beetle, which was also, they began the production a little bit later,

598
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:33,860
but also ended period between the first and second world war. So why, well,

599
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:38,860
this we've covered already mostly, but well, the most important thing here is

600
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,380
in the last bullet points.

601
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,820
I mean, why is the car such a revolutionary

602
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,500
and such an important mode of transport

603
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,540
to be mentioned here,

604
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,580
is that for the very first time mobility,

605
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,100
motorized mobility is an individual exercise.

606
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,900
It's no longer only a motorized or a horse-drawn street

607
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,020
car that allows you to cover long distances

608
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,500
of taking a train, a suburban train

609
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,020
that takes you to the factory and back.

610
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,500
But it is an individual vehicle,

611
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:14,620
an individual product that allows you to reach unprecedented levels of individual mobility.

612
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:23,900
And of course, that immediately had a very important impact on the way that the cities are planned and imagined.

613
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:36,780
Well, without running the risk of maybe a little bit of drawing some kind of caricature,

614
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:44,580
This impact starting from especially the Second World War when it was a very strong narrative

615
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:50,460
of the need of modernizing cities, especially in North America and Western Europe.

616
00:39:50,460 --> 00:40:00,980
A lot of cities became basically a perfect space for driving around a space in which huge

617
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,540
amounts of infrastructure for this individual car base mobility was built.

618
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:11,460
This process started a little bit early in the US and the 1940s and 50s already and after

619
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,900
the Second World War, that narrative was started to be very present in Western European

620
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,900
specifics.

621
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,540
Both of these images, by the way, come from a really wonderful film by Jacques T. I believe

622
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,140
is called Playtime from the 1967, which I really recommend.

623
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:32,740
He watches a great critique of this idea, this framing of modernity, which also very much

624
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,740
changes on the idea of having a car of driving around.

625
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:43,100
And well, moving to more serious stuff,

626
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,900
I mean, accommodating the car in a city meant

627
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,180
that serious infrastructure had to be built.

628
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,500
A serious self had to happen in cities at the time

629
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,540
for the car to receive this kind of space.

630
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,540
Some of the most important projects happen in the US,

631
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,540
As I mentioned on the left hand side,

632
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,420
you've got the Franklin Delano-Rousville Drive

633
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,820
and open in 1966 in New York.

634
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,100
On the right hand side,

635
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,980
the infamous Pont de Morandean,

636
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,580
and you know, in Italy 1967,

637
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,100
which unfortunately collapsed,

638
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,180
I believe, two years ago,

639
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,460
which also symbolized, of course,

640
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,420
it's a terrible event,

641
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,180
but for many,

642
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,220
it was a very powerful symbol

643
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,780
of this infrastructure crumbling

644
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,780
and an important question of what to do

645
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,780
with these relics of modernity or past modernity,

646
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,340
whether they should be, in this case, rebuilt or maintained

647
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,260
or invested in, whether this is something

648
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,740
that we want to graduate dismantle

649
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,380
and stop subsidize his maintenance of these infrastructures

650
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,380
is undoubtedly very costly.

651
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,940
And the next slide, does anybody have a clue

652
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,700
where this city is?

653
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,140
- Chalua. - Very good.

654
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,820
Well done, yes, this is the...

655
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,180
I don't remember the name of the road, but...

656
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,060
Yeah, yeah, it's in the next slide, so I'm so silly.

657
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,020
I mean, Bez is our nine built in 90,

658
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,620
or opened in 1976.

659
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,620
I don't know if you ever had the experience of driving this,

660
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,980
but it's really a time-canny.

661
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,660
It makes me personally feel as if I was in some Chinese

662
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,660
or other Asian city where you were here.

663
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,300
on this elevated platform, almost gliding through the city.

664
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,860
So it's really one of the, I think,

665
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,740
most extreme or more extreme cases,

666
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,500
at least in this part of Europe,

667
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,180
of really plowing through a city

668
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,340
to build this motorway ring route.

669
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,060
But Charlie, wow, it was not the only one.

670
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,660
I mean, we are, after all,

671
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,460
or I don't know where you are right now,

672
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,340
but most of us are in Brussels right now.

673
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,860
And Brussels was definitely also a playground

674
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,620
for many of these ideas.

675
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,780
And the idea of bringing the car and opening the city

676
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,460
to the car, like in American cities,

677
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,940
at least that was the comparison use in Belgium,

678
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,660
became particularly strong

679
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,500
and particularly potent among the political class

680
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,420
that decision makers around 1958.

681
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,860
What happened in 1958?

682
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,740
I guess you've heard that date before.

683
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,780
Any non-belgence?

684
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,540
1958, why is that important for Brussels?

685
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,180
The X-word, the X-word.

686
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,180
- That tell me.

687
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,100
- The Atomium.

688
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,260
And why would the Atomium be, well, okay,

689
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,260
the World X-flow, symbolized by the Atomium,

690
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,260
and why would that be related to the car?

691
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:47,300
You really don't have any ideas?

692
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,780
I mean, if you're opening a World X-flow

693
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,460
for the very first time in Belgium and inviting,

694
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,460
I don't remember how many people actually visited

695
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,300
the X-plain at the end,

696
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:00,500
millions of people visited the city. Why would Car be important?

697
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,340
Would the Car be important in that regard?

698
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:08,180
For putting Buzzum on the map?

699
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,900
It's worth it, Buzzum on the map.

700
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,420
The connection to go into it.

701
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,780
It's also the message.

702
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:21,620
It's to serve the idea of, I mean, not the idea, the problem of congestion is to bring

703
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,420
these masses to the Expo and back is to allow for a better communication but also to put

704
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:32,420
Belgium on the map to show that Belgium is a modern country. To show that it's on you know cutting

705
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:38,100
edge and being cutting edge in 1958 in Belgium meant opening the city for the car and building

706
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:44,020
huge infrastructure or started least to build huge infrastructure that would accommodate this new

707
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:51,620
modern US-like American way of mobility or moving around the city.

708
00:44:51,620 --> 00:45:00,900
So yeah, some things that are quite unthinkable today, we're going on at that time.

709
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:08,900
So this is Gaborne Plus, I think it's in the 1960s. So of course, Expo was a symbolic event.

710
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,900
And it didn't really, it was not just tipping points.

711
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,380
There were a lot of dynamics happening in the time

712
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,700
and the export was maybe more of a symbolic moment.

713
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,980
But it is around the time that the level of authorization

714
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,940
at the level of ownership of cars in Belgian households

715
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,140
and similar processes are mentioning Belgium here,

716
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,780
but similar things were going on in France

717
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,620
in Germany in the UK.

718
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,940
It went through the roof.

719
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,620
So it was very, very common back then

720
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,740
to invest in the car as a symbol of advancing

721
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,740
as a household as a symbol of social mobility,

722
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,300
not only a physical geograph,

723
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,860
but that of course meant that more and more space

724
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,940
had to be given to the car

725
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,740
and as the car became more present,

726
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,740
more people pulled the car.

727
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,700
So the circle was closed and there was a vicious one.

728
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,580
In Brussels specifically,

729
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,540
well, one of the most important interest structures

730
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,940
built the time is the Petit Santu,

731
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,820
so the ring road that surrounds the Pentagon of the city.

732
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,020
I'm sure that you've all been there.

733
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,980
So essentially,

734
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:17,100
the framing of it,

735
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,700
right, the actual shape of the Pentagon comes

736
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,020
from the city walls,

737
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,660
the second walls of Brussels coming from the 14th century,

738
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,660
completely destroyed,

739
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,460
which defined it as the re-center of the city still.

740
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,700
And until the 1950s,

741
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,420
it was very much an urban bulldog

742
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,780
which one could stroll and walk very much like in the drawings rather than photographs that I

743
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:42,820
showed you at the beginning from the city of walking city that was very much defined by the

744
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:52,020
pedestrian mode of moving around. In relation to the 1958s, I had to be gradually transformed.

745
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:59,220
So a series of first tunnels were built and the surface was raised to open to the car.

746
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,700
It took 20 years of work, which is not a very unusual thing in Brussels to do.

747
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,540
So two decades of extremely heavy work and very destructive work,

748
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,980
whole neighborhoods had to be relocated, destroyed, rebuilt.

749
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,820
So opened in 1976 with 15 tunnels surrounding the city.

750
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,380
Also quite importantly, and that's maybe a bit of an extreme story that

751
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,500
not necessarily happened also in France or in Germany or another,

752
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,860
Western European cities.

753
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,460
But what was very crucial in rehearsals is that the engineering team,

754
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,900
so the engineering officers, consultancy officers,

755
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,340
we call them today, would receive personal bonus on top of the salary

756
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,860
for every kilometer of an underground tunnel built.

757
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:48,500
So that led to creation of a huge push to build underground infrastructure for mobility,

758
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,020
both for cars, but also for railroad and metro.

759
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,700
And that led to a creation of very important expertise

760
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,740
in building these underground tunnels,

761
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,100
which of course, once you have that expertise,

762
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,380
you of course want to keep building more

763
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,380
because that's what you are very good at doing.

764
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,260
And that problem in Brussels,

765
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,180
well, problem situation exists until today

766
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,340
where we have huge teams of engineering,

767
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,260
specialists who specialize in building underground,

768
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,820
in steep and about the transport company in Brussels.

769
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,820
Half of the company is responsible

770
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,780
for metro for its maintenance and construction.

771
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,860
So you can imagine that what you want to do,

772
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,500
of course, is to keep building a metro,

773
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,660
which is what they are currently doing in Brussels.

774
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:35,380
Moving a little bit or zooming out a little bit from cities,

775
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,900
the large scale diffusion of the car

776
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,940
or the automobile as a mass consumption project,

777
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,780
of course, was strongly also influenced

778
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,140
or maybe also led to a dynamic,

779
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,780
to the emergence of first nationwide highway systems.

780
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:57,100
The first one created was of course the one in the US.

781
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,900
The American interstate highway system,

782
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,300
which began to be not many completely built from scratch,

783
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,540
but the first framing of it and continuous gradual addition

784
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,900
to the network in 1956.

785
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,820
Which was, of course, back then that symbol of modernity,

786
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,980
that in many other places, Belgium being one of them

787
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,020
influenced the definition of the idea

788
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,420
of what was modern or was cutting edge wars,

789
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,780
technologically advanced.

790
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,860
Today, of course, it's not the US anymore

791
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,700
that it's leading country or the leading power

792
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,900
in terms of the development of transport, technology,

793
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,220
and highways in particular.

794
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,420
That system that American system has been

795
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,540
by now surpassed definitely by the one in China.

796
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,860
The national trunk highway system here,

797
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,340
I have a little bit of an old graph,

798
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,660
but by 2011, as far as I can read it, well,

799
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,180
but already 2009, the total amount of kilometers

800
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,620
of motorways in both countries,

801
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,140
US and China was equal.

802
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,260
And the one in China, of course,

803
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,740
was rising still very steep.

804
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,420
But you can see that this, I don't like the term,

805
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,740
let's say the catching up on this idea of following a little bit in the

806
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,660
footsteps of what the Americans did in the 1950s. In China happened in an

807
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:24,260
extremely short time which not only because of the construction of the

808
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,540
motorways but this was a very important part of the construction boom meant

809
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:36,580
that from 2006 to 2007 onwards now the situation is a little bit different

810
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,540
because of the ongoing crisis and also other problems that Chinese

811
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:46,340
economy suffered from, but the consumption or the demand for concrete in China was bigger than

812
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:51,700
in all other countries around the world combined. So this was really a boom of an unprecedented

813
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:59,940
scale and we will see a few other graphs down the lecture which show us that while in many

814
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,500
cities and many countries don't know what we might be thinking that we are moving away from the

815
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,420
the current right now, but that's the idea that the other parts of the world that did

816
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:15,340
not experience this development at the same time as local North are now definitely contributing

817
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:21,500
to not even I would say persistence or vulnerability, but actually it's continuous rise

818
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:28,540
in the global scale. What was very important going back to the Belgium context of the

819
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,540
in the 1950s and 1960s.

820
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:34,540
It's also difficult to say what was first the car

821
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,340
or the suburbs or the suburbs in the car,

822
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,740
but the two were extremely strongly linked

823
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,420
with one another.

824
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,060
Having the car, and as I mentioned,

825
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,620
as I explained, the car became a very common popular

826
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,340
and cheap commodity.

827
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,380
Not only did you find how you moved to work

828
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,220
and you move around the city,

829
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,540
but actually it's again,

830
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,300
redefine what the city is.

831
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,860
So suddenly areas which would be normally considered rule

832
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,420
become accessible and become interesting for people

833
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,100
to settle in.

834
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,940
The idea also being that you have more space,

835
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,940
more freedom,

836
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:14,060
you are close to your close to nature, et cetera, et cetera.

837
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,100
These days it might feel like it's something of the past,

838
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:23,100
something that is not interesting to many urbanites

839
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,140
of today, but back then it was absolutely

840
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:33,500
way to the way to go, the way to live, the way to think that one should invest as a household

841
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:45,980
in a home market, in property market. The special results of that, the double dynamic of

842
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:53,180
motorization of one hand, suborganization of the other, was that if a pre industrial city had a

843
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:58,860
more or less 10% of its space devoted to transport and mobility. An industrial

844
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:07,340
modern city has between 15 and 30% and that's rough estimates from Western Europe to up to 60%

845
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:14,380
in some American cities of space will be given to mobility infrastructure which is principally

846
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:22,220
highways and parking lots, which of course is a huge spatial cost.

847
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:30,220
And, well, another development, of course, is that the commuting area that we start to call it,

848
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:38,220
so the actual definition of what a city is, regardless of administrative limits and different boundaries,

849
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:45,220
of course, this would be often divided into some municipalities and all, it goes up to 100 kilometres in diameter.

850
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,220
So suddenly what is a city becomes,

851
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:53,220
it stands becoming a little bit vague in the sense that the old urban course,

852
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:59,220
of course, do not hold all the functions anymore and we start seeing cities,

853
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,220
expanding at least in economic terms.

854
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:14,220
Well, without running into the risk of simplifying things a little bit too much,

855
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:26,220
But what happened in a lot of cities, both in North America and in Western Europe, is that as the car became more and more popular and as moving by car became absolutely common.

856
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:34,220
And if you basically had a middle-class job, that's what you did. You lived in the suburbs and you created through the office job by car.

857
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,900
Trans-and companies, or mass transit companies,

858
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,960
probably transport companies,

859
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,740
started to run into serious financial difficulties.

860
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:47,180
So traditionally, when they were actually set up

861
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:51,220
in the 19th century, 1910s, 1920s,

862
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,860
they would be private companies very often,

863
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,900
private railroads bringing workers

864
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,180
to the suburbs in Darchle, bringing the bourgeois

865
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,860
and people who wanted to enjoy leisure

866
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,220
outside of the city and then back.

867
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:07,220
As they started to run into trouble in some countries,

868
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,100
and that's usually the case in Western Europe,

869
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,100
they would be nationalized.

870
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,700
They would be taken over by the state

871
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,900
as an important part of military infrastructure,

872
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,620
but also an important part of mobility infrastructure

873
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,580
and kept, but they enrolled the societal role

874
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,700
with definitely declined,

875
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,940
so they would become something not necessarily

876
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,860
for the middle class, but rather for the working class.

877
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:32,580
Belgium here is some sort of an exception

878
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,060
because a lot of commuting here,

879
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:38,020
due to the fact that the railway system was traditionally

880
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:42,460
been very dense, happened and still is happening

881
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,980
very much through public transport.

882
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,380
But that's definitely not the case in the UK, for example,

883
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,540
or definitely not in North America.

884
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,220
But, and sticking to North America,

885
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:55,260
in a number of cities over there,

886
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,220
the process that happened was inverse.

887
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,940
So the decline of public transit did not

888
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,500
lead to any investment by the state.

889
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,140
either on federal or on the state-state level,

890
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,860
but rather eventually dismantling

891
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,860
of public transport systems happened.

892
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,260
And a very particular story is that of the general

893
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,420
modus company.

894
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,980
So one of the main producers of these masks

895
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,700
come on with these with the cars.

896
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,580
Who threw out the 1940s basically bought

897
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,460
a number of public transport companies,

898
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,580
massive companies as they are called over there.

899
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,580
and purposely led to the decline.

900
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:33,420
Why?

901
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,220
Well, the idea was quite simple.

902
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,220
It was basically the derivative of the competition

903
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:41,100
that public transport could have posed

904
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,020
to the individual ability to the car.

905
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:48,060
So the idea was to push public transport out of the market.

906
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:52,860
And again, I just saw the comment from somebody.

907
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:57,100
And again, yes, the idea of course

908
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,380
was that this was also framed by the discourse

909
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,900
of modernity and advancing as a society.

910
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,940
I forgot to mention that we will be taking a break

911
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,980
in both today and in the week.

912
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,980
I don't think that sticking to the stream

913
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,740
to ours is a helpful thing to do.

914
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,700
So we will take a break actually in three minutes

915
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,580
probably for about five minutes.

916
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,380
And just in case you're getting a little bit tight.

917
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:26,260
But this total decline or some would even say it is up

918
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,980
I would even say a disaster in terms of what happened to mass transport, mass transit,

919
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,380
sorry, public transport was not always the case.

920
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:38,500
So as I already mentioned, in some countries, public transport networks actually were

921
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,060
taken over by the state and even invested in.

922
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:47,220
And one important thing that happened, or a symbolic project that happened is that of Copenhagen's

923
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,860
fingerplant from 1947.

924
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:55,100
So basically there, the decision was made to create an alternative, or maybe not a substitute,

925
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,980
an alternative parallel to car commuting.

926
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:03,240
Basically suburban rail, which follows the shape of fine figures.

927
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,700
Corridors that would not only be transport corridors,

928
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,620
but also along which a number of different functions,

929
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,620
especially residential, but also economic work,

930
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:17,420
related functions would be placed as well.

931
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,420
And that was, as far as I know, one of the first plans

932
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:23,360
that try to achieve what we call

933
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,680
transport-oriented development, or development

934
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,240
urban development that happens around, or in this particular case,

935
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:33,800
along transport corridors to allow for different mobility

936
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,400
options back then, maybe, environmental issues

937
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,120
were not so much on the agenda, but the idea

938
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,120
was that people would be able to get more efficiently

939
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:46,120
to work, not only by car, but also by suburban rail.

940
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:51,800
In our lovely Brussels, well, things were not so easy,

941
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,840
Well, things were a little bit in between.

942
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,760
So on the one hand, the car was definitely the king.

943
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,760
And actually it's one of the slogans in Brussels

944
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,000
sent it academia and public debate.

945
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,640
Car it became the king around the 1950s

946
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,320
with the expo of the 1958.

947
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,400
And still very much is a very present

948
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,960
and very privileged lot of transport.

949
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,320
But public transport, of course, did not

950
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,560
disappear on one of the particularities of Brussels

951
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,240
is that unlike in Sharawa, for example,

952
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,560
or many cities in Germany or in France,

953
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,120
especially Trang was, for example,

954
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,920
were never completely dismantled.

955
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,640
And you would see, and I can't think of any specific names

956
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,200
right now in France, but there are cities in which

957
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,280
Trang, way network existed, you know, 1940s, '50s and '60s,

958
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,360
and then was completely dismantled to open a surface space

959
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,600
to the car.

960
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,360
So what happened in Brussels is that the Trang was basically

961
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,480
put on the ground, so you see on top left,

962
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,840
Rinalalwa, which is that magnificent open waterway these days.

963
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,680
And you see a tram trying to plow its way

964
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,120
through the city, standing in a traffic jam.

965
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,000
The idea, well, of course, the city has packed

966
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,480
the spaces limited with the rise of mobility

967
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,560
and the individual mobility.

968
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,600
And the rise of an hour of course, traffic jams happen.

969
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,120
The decision there was made not to make more space

970
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:19,560
the tram would make to make more space for the car. So a strategic decision was to put the tram

971
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:26,200
first underground, creating a very particular mode of transport made in Brussels called pre-metro

972
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:33,960
kamitho, which then eventually as it was actually planned was converted into a full scale,

973
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,680
as we call it in Brussels, heavy metro metrolu. You can actually see a pre-metrol still,

974
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:43,800
and that's line three and four in Brussels at Tramline that goes from north to south of the Pentagon,

975
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:49,720
which as you probably have heard is now well will soon be converted into a proper

976
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,240
metro of once and a new metro line from the gallery knob and northwards is constructed.

977
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:01,080
So you get for example C, I don't know if you ever had a chance of you know noting that the

978
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,760
platforms and although this is a trans stock the platforms are actually much much wider than

979
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,960
and usually would be in the case of a tram

980
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,720
and they are much longer.

981
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,440
Basically they were built,

982
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,280
I think already back in the 70s,

983
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,800
anticipating a proper metro, we are now in 2020.

984
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,040
So if I need a metro, it's happening,

985
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,000
although well, it's a controversial project to sit at least.

986
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,200
Let's take a little break here,

987
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,600
not longer than five, six minutes.

988
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,320
So grab another tea, you're a coffee,

989
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,000
and I'll see you back in four, five minutes, all right?

990

Welcome back all of you. I hope you grabbed another drink or whatever it is that you are

having. Grab another notebook to keep helping things, although of course you've got the

1055
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:55,460
recording of all this. And I can see that some people are asking questions. I might also

1056
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:01,140
ask you with up to now, up to now everything has been clear or you've got any questions

1057
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:06,420
about what I've been talking about. If yes, please raise your hand, just speak up. But I think

1058
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:13,780
it's an interesting question that Mika asked here in the chat, whether in need what's happening

1059
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:20,100
right now is that we have an increased desire for what we could say is a pre-industrial city,

1060
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:28,420
a city of walking of short distances, density of uses, mixes. Does anybody have an opinion on this?

1061
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,900
Would you agree? Would you not agree?

1062
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:40,180
Or maybe Mika, whether he or she is, has an opinion?

1063
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:50,020
It's me. Yeah, I wasn't sure if it's really linked to the pre-industrial city, but when you explained

1064
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:56,420
how it was looking, how it looked like.

1065
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:00,660
I thought about actually it's exactly what today's planning is about.

1066
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:12,580
Like this mixed use, this like, and narrow streets where you workability and short distances.

1067
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:17,300
And I mean, maybe it's also really a European perspective.

1068
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:26,020
I'm not sure about that. I thought maybe it could be like a new role model of today's planning.

1069
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:30,740
Does anybody have an opinion on this? Would anybody like to react?

1070
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:46,740
I can compare it for example in Antroop. I live in the center of the city.

1071
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:54,500
but we see that the place for private cars is reducing.

1072
01:08:54,500 --> 01:09:02,420
For example, they put parking lots under undergrounds for making some leisure activities or parks

1073
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:09,860
or something else. So we see a movement, I guess, when we focus on that. And definitely in Brussels,

1074
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:13,700
depending on the policy now, it's more ecological

1075
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:20,180
minus and we see more opportunities to reduce

1076
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:26,420
parking lots and more movements like for example in Anspaklam.

1077
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:31,220
In the Kitton years it's called the pedestrian area of Brussels.

1078
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,020
Yeah yeah.

1079
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:36,260
We couldn't imagine I guess 20 years ago so we see different movements.

1080
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,180
Yeah, there is definitely some kind of shift happening.

1081
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:46,020
I mean, we are not in the 1960s or 70s, not where what is right now on this slide.

1082
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:50,420
Things have moved on. The presence of the car is definitely put on the question.

1083
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:53,700
But is this about going to a three-industrial city?

1084
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,980
What would be the problem with that?

1085
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:59,940
Or would be the risk of just to revert into walking, let's say,

1086
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,420
if that's what the pre-industrial city was about.

1087
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:10,020
as anybody have, you know, an opinion on this. There was no wrong answers here.

1088
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:16,260
We tell you saying that new mobility plans are aiming in the best of use of all technologies

1089
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:23,460
we have now with maximum inclusivity. Yeah, I guess so. Proof is in the, you know,

1090
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:29,780
well, it depends on how they, of course, implemented and it's the idea, of course, is that

1091
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,780
that everybody is included and we use all the technologies we have.

1092
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:36,280
In practice, we will see that it's a little bit complicated.

1093
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:46,780
Maybe it's also the light when we were looking at the metro system that it's more about underground transportation.

1094
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:49,280
So like separation.

1095
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,380
Okay.

1096
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,880
Transportation systems.

1097
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,480
Somebody else started talking. Who was that?

1098
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:28,380
Yeah, that was me. And also what I wanted to bring up was this idea of Brussels is a productive city where industries or small businesses are still located and where people can have, you know, can find jobs almost in their neighborhood that it, you know, especially maybe jobs that don't necessarily pay so well that wouldn't be interesting for other people to to commute into the city to. And I think these kind of businesses are a bit under pressure from.

1099
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:34,380
the reduction in space that they have on, you know, to organize these productive activities.

1100
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:42,380
So I think, yeah, space in front of their, in front of the street, to actually do their deliveries.

1101
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:48,860
And I think as a tension there in the kind of city, you want, and the way you want the service,

1102
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:56,860
different neighborhoods and different areas. So one of the cases was like these smaller construction,

1103
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:01,860
and supplies kind of stores, maybe in the area of LAC and,

1104
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,300
like not far from the canal,

1105
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:08,940
serving a kind of secondary places where,

1106
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,420
you just wouldn't go to Brico

1107
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:14,380
for those kind of materials, you would go to your neighborhood

1108
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:18,780
and that's becoming harder to maintain

1109
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:22,220
in an urban environment that gives more space to walking

1110
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:29,660
to buy claims and so on. So that's on the one side. It doesn't mean that I agree, but it's,

1111
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:37,580
I think one of the pressures that is being felt by that group.

1112
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:41,980
I guess what's important what you said, and to relate it also to what I was talking about

1113
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:45,980
before and what Vitali there is, the right thing is that there is some with each of these

1114
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:51,900
technological shifts. Of course, they are very, I mean, it's a very broad sketch. These things

1115
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,620
when all happening in sudden turns, it's a process.

1116
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:59,380
But space is valorised in different ways.

1117
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:04,380
And for example, if we see here in this slide, as I mentioned,

1118
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,260
clearly space became very limited with the rise of the cars.

1119
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,820
And the decision was made of the space is extremely valuable.

1120
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,860
And it should be given to the modes that

1121
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,980
is the most efficient in terms of speed,

1122
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:18,620
as the most rational mode also, not only economically

1123
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:20,740
or temporally efficient.

1124
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:24,740
So other modes like public transport, I haven't even mentioned cycling there,

1125
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:28,340
had to disappear or be moved elsewhere.

1126
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:30,860
And I think what's happening right now is some kind of

1127
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,540
revolarization of space.

1128
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,900
But space is always limited.

1129
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:40,260
So if you take it, I mean, if you give it to one or some set of users,

1130
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:44,420
which I think also, perhaps we will have time to talk about it next week,

1131
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,980
has a clear class component.

1132
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:53,820
So there is a clear middle class idea behind opening central airman spaces to walking, cycling,

1133
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:56,940
and public transport and taking it away from the car.

1134
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,500
So if you give it to these kind of users, you have to take it away from others, in this

1135
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,380
case, the car.

1136
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:07,020
And I think an important question is to ask, well, if we want the car to disappear from

1137
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,740
the city life, from Russell's, who is using the car, right?

1138
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:17,740
me who is dependent on it. For example, these businesses, small shops that, I don't know,

1139
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:23,100
either, well, I mean, the productive activity requires accessibility by cow. But also, I think,

1140
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:29,500
probably you've heard right now in this pandemic crazy times, people are talking about 15 minute

1141
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:35,580
neighbourhood and the idea of how the pandemic has shown us that we can, well, since we

1142
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:40,460
essentially, and many of us stop a lot of activities. We start walking around and cycling and all that.

1143
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:46,380
So the idea that maybe we could use this to reorganize the cities around 15 minute

1144
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:51,180
perimeters walking perimeters within which we can all find all the users and functions that we need.

1145
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:57,340
But I think an important question there is who actually lives so close to a good school,

1146
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:04,140
a good job and all that. And in Perasos, many other cities, there will be a lot of people who need to

1147
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,660
to find employment quite far from where they live.

1148
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:10,260
And a lot of them would have to go by car

1149
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,860
to get to that job.

1150
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,740
So what, you know, what then,

1151
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:19,140
I will continue with the lecture,

1152
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:23,020
but I hope there will be space for more questions.

1153
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,940
There was one point that I want to make

1154
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:27,540
that is, you know, I don't want to say

1155
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:30,220
a main conclusion of this historical trajectory,

1156
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,180
but I think an important point

1157
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,780
to keep in mind, you know, this is that

1158
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:41,460
it's not just a descriptive, you know,

1159
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,900
to the force of what different modes of transport

1160
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,820
were there and how it impacted the urban form.

1161
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,820
I think this is something that is maybe

1162
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,260
a little bit interesting, but essentially,

1163
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,420
I don't think it's very critical

1164
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,740
and doesn't really allow us to understand

1165
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,860
too much about how the city functions are functioned

1166
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:57,860
in the past.

1167
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,540
I think what's very important though

1168
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,100
is that with each of these shifts,

1169
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:04,860
with each of these turning points and dynamics

1170
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:08,900
that led to shift in terms of how people move.

1171
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:12,380
We're getting closer and closer to the situation

1172
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:14,340
that we have today, which is that transport

1173
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:17,180
is absolutely crucial not only for the development

1174
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:22,020
of cities, but for the development of the socioeconomic system

1175
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,700
in which we live today on the global scale,

1176
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:27,740
which is of global capitalism.

1177
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:31,860
So it would be impossible for the current socioeconomic relations

1178
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,740
to develop to the point that they have developed

1179
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:36,460
without transport and without the development of transport

1180
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:37,260
and vice versa.

1181
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,580
So outside of the capitalist system,

1182
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:42,300
they probably would not have been such a push

1183
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,580
for development of individual mobility, for example,

1184
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,940
and the visual mobility by car that is propelled

1185
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:51,300
by fossil fuels with all the geopolitical

1186
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:55,740
and environmental atrocities and impacts that this produces.

1187
01:16:55,740 --> 01:17:19,740
Essentially transport or transport geography is a discipline required space not only to be conquered physically in terms of distance basically moving from A to B would become as fast as short of a time as possible, but also some kind of imaginary and cartographical colonisation of concrete of space.

1188
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:25,820
If we go back to end of the 18th century, for example, in Europe, well, the majority of

1189
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:30,380
people who inhabited, well, maybe eight of the 17th century to be a little bit less controversial,

1190
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:34,380
but the majority of people who lived on our continent and definitely the majority of people

1191
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:39,820
who lived on our planet did not live under jurisdiction of any state or any state administration.

1192
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:45,180
They essentially lived outside the state structures. Of course, states and administration existed,

1193
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:51,740
But most people lived in villages in areas where once in a while, a tax collector would

1194
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:56,460
maybe show up or be quite easy to avoid the encounter with that kind of gentleman,

1195
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:00,460
rather not gentle moment, I'm afraid.

1196
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:05,260
So it's at this point, and I think transport is absolutely crucial for understanding of

1197
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:09,580
why this happened and how this happened, that there happened or the beginning to happen

1198
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:13,580
in a strategic expansion of state infrastructure and state administration.

1199
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:18,540
predominantly related security reasons and search for different forms of capital,

1200
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:25,980
for instance, slavery, so trying to reach different places where bodies could be snatched,

1201
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,620
taken into captivity and then sold or propelled into productivity.

1202
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:36,620
But for the state to be able to organize this process, it had to develop its

1203
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:42,620
cartography, it has to develop its dominance, its knowledge, its control over space.

1204
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:49,180
And here we see a map of France in the 1632, which is essentially, well, we've seen some roads,

1205
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:56,540
we see some cities and connections between those. But this radically changes with the

1206
01:18:56,540 --> 01:19:01,180
development of state's interest in terms of the resources, as I mentioned, bodies, people,

1207
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:08,300
but also of course other natural resources would anything that you can mine and I don't know

1208
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:13,420
it's not especially here in terms of who you can be interested in as a state but what essentially

1209
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:19,660
happened is that from a natural space, a space that was inhabited, a space that was lived,

1210
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:28,460
we started moving into a fire name of abstracted of of absolute space that is very much related

1211
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:35,020
to the consolidation of states infrastructure as a way of organizing social and material order

1212
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:40,220
that is on the ground to bureaucratically govern it to rule it from the distance, from a very top

1213
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:45,660
down perspective. The example of France is very interesting because literally over there the decision

1214
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:52,700
was made of course not immediately in one meeting but progressively it was a state bureaucracy

1215
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:58,940
a rather decision to divide the state in more or less equally shaped areas, the departments

1216
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:04,620
based on a regular grid. On the left hand side you see there's some kind of conceptualization of

1217
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:10,300
this. On the right hand side we see a result which is the actual, the eventual division. I think one

1218
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:16,300
of the first ones in the French territory. I think today of course it's not exactly the same that

1219
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:19,460
has developed for different historical reasons.

1220
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,460
But the idea was very important.

1221
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:25,820
The Ministry of Reform of the 1790

1222
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:30,020
would replace an old feudal tribal, even division

1223
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:33,300
of territories into--

1224
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:36,100
it would be your place with abstract bureaucratic logic

1225
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,340
that would be applied in a more or less the same way

1226
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:46,180
in each of these territories, each of these departments.

1227
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,180
this week in skip.

1228
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:51,300
What was very important in this development

1229
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:58,300
is that the state needed very much universal,

1230
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,620
I don't know how to put it, a reliable system

1231
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:05,100
of measuring space and other related phenomena,

1232
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,260
such as, for example, time and quantity.

1233
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:10,700
It might be very difficult for us to imagine this,

1234
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:14,380
but the unification of measuring systems

1235
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:19,100
of time and space and quantity was something that took a very long time and it was definitely not

1236
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:26,060
in place until end of the even 17 or 18 centuries. So it took a very long time to actually make sure

1237
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:32,380
- sorry - make sure that all inhabitants of a given nation state of a given territory would actually

1238
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:37,660
subjugate themselves to the usage of a unified - that's the word I was looking for - unified

1239
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:43,500
metric or measurement system. So for example the unification of the metric systems in Germany took

1240
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:50,460
place in as late as 1868 in Austria in 1871 and Hungary three years later in Russia in 1919

1241
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:56,940
and in China only in 1959. What does it mean? It means that there exist of course ways of measuring

1242
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:01,500
but there will be culturally dependent or there will be spatially dependent. So a particular

1243
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:08,700
unit of measurement, a foot, an elbow would mean different things and different villages.

1244
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,060
It would mean different things at a different times of the day or year. It would mean different

1245
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:18,540
things whether it would be the activity of selling or buying. For example, you would sell

1246
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:26,380
a small bag of rice and buy a big one. There was a difference between that's in many pre-colonial,

1247
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:32,540
African communities, kingdoms. There will be a division between strong measures for selling

1248
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:39,100
goods and weak measures for buying goods. So there was a huge diversity of different ways of

1249
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:43,180
measuring space, measuring time, and measuring quantity.

1250
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:47,260
All that in all the, and also because of, and again,

1251
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:50,380
this is a two-way dynamic, the development of the transport

1252
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:53,420
system and the development of state as an institution

1253
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:56,140
or a set of institutions that had to control space,

1254
01:22:56,140 --> 01:23:01,860
quantity, and time gave way to a unified system,

1255
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:04,580
of which transport is absolutely central in here.

1256
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:08,340
I mean, the symbolic one meter, which is, of course,

1257
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:14,420
huge upstream agreement that we are in, that this is what one meter is, and the same could be said

1258
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:20,900
about the kilogram of the second and many others. Moving a little bit more, going a little bit

1259
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:27,300
more into transport here, I mentioned time and for example as late as in the late 18th century,

1260
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:31,860
distance between particular cities and as a result travel times between particular cities,

1261
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:37,380
such as in Germany, we're not fixed or set.

1262
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:41,380
So in 1881, German railways or different kinds of German

1263
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:43,300
railways because there was no one national system

1264
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,900
followed to five different times us, which

1265
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:49,380
were different not by one hour but by a different amount of minutes,

1266
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:52,660
which meant that basically one area, I guess,

1267
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:57,140
the archaea color coded, would be five or seven minutes ahead of the other one,

1268
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,780
which meant that the passengers had to do the calculation themselves.

1269
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:06,340
it was all an oral agreement and an ongoing discussion between the passengers and the staff

1270
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:12,180
to understand what time things would happen, what time the train would depart, leave, etc.

1271
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:23,780
And as I mentioned, this integration of measurement system, integration of different modes of

1272
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:28,020
of transport networks allowed the state to control,

1273
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:33,620
to consolidate the territory, and to basically be able

1274
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:37,060
to develop socioeconomic relations that we take today

1275
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:40,780
very much for granted.

1276
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,620
This was absolutely crucial.

1277
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,780
I mean, the reason why I'm making this a bit of a digression

1278
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:47,820
and the departure from historic trajectories

1279
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:51,300
that this was absolutely crucial, this colonisation of space

1280
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,420
and colonization of what we consider to be

1281
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,940
a very much of a social or good consideration,

1282
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:59,140
social activity, movement and transport is,

1283
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,540
was absolutely crucial for the development of,

1284
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:03,340
again, what we take very much for granted,

1285
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:07,220
the global networks of YS, cables, railroads,

1286
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:08,420
highways in this particular case,

1287
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:12,300
I already showed you that map,

1288
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:17,300
allowing transport to lubricate the capitalist global system.

1289
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:22,060
And today, this colonization of space,

1290
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:25,140
if we can call it this way, it's no longer a national matter,

1291
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:27,340
it's no longer nation-states that are propelling this process.

1292
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:30,660
It's something that has happened very much on the global scale.

1293
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:36,860
What was very important in this very long trajectory

1294
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,860
started very quickly at the end of the 17th century.

1295
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:41,780
Now we are in 1950s.

1296
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:45,140
What was very important is that the whole science developed

1297
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:49,780
around this colonization of different measuring systems

1298
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:54,260
of different ways of living and interacting with space.

1299
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:58,060
And this size, on this scientific field,

1300
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,420
I think we can call it a set of neoclassical perspectives

1301
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:05,940
on not only transport, also on economics, on social life,

1302
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:09,420
which in transport itself is very much present,

1303
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,620
is very much dominated by, on the 100 transport engineers,

1304
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,820
on the other and the transcoli economists.

1305
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:20,420
What I'm talking about here is basically the main, say,

1306
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,460
and I will not talk a lot about this,

1307
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:27,060
but basically if you went to a master degree,

1308
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,340
which I'm very happy you did it,

1309
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:31,380
but if you went to a master degree in transport management

1310
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:34,220
or logistics at any technical university,

1311
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:36,020
this is very much what you would be learning today,

1312
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:38,620
which I guess at this time of the day or night,

1313
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,940
which we are a bit more boring, I hope,

1314
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:45,060
and what I have to offer, but hope there is no regrets here

1315
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,900
in the room today.

1316
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,780
But if you want to be an engineer,

1317
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:49,500
and if you want to be an economist to go rose,

1318
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,260
this is basically what you learn.

1319
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,540
Why is it called Neoplastico Transport?

1320
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:57,140
Well, very much it relates to Neoplastico Economics,

1321
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:01,380
which deals with a cold, blooded analysis,

1322
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,660
a study of distribution, production of goods,

1323
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:07,340
outputs, and income through.

1324
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:10,180
And that's absolutely crucial supply and demand.

1325
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:15,980
So a system which has to be an equivalent equilibrium,

1326
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:23,180
which essentially looks at transport as a part or a separate market in which transport

1327
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:33,700
is a good commodity which is offered in the market, passengers being its consumers.

1328
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:34,700
What is important here?

1329
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:39,700
There are two main principles, which very much today, again,

1330
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:42,540
in academia, but also very much in the world of practitioners.

1331
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:45,020
So the world of those who plan roads, who build roads,

1332
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:47,020
who claim that we need a new metro line,

1333
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:50,260
we need a more to way, or that this or that particular mode

1334
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,020
of transport is absolutely essential

1335
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:55,140
for contemporary cities to thrive.

1336
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:57,580
So these two dogmas say that on the one hand,

1337
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:01,180
transport is an essentially rational discipline.

1338
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:07,180
It's a discipline that is rational because it has to be developed by experts.

1339
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:12,580
It's a top-down discipline that requires it to top-down cartographic vision of space,

1340
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:17,180
which can reduce to its absolute universal measures.

1341
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:24,180
That also means that there is a science behind it, which means that it's not an issue that can be fully open to a public debate.

1342
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:37,180
It's a part of urban life that has to be developed by experts and only experts can have the final word in terms of decision-making, in terms of how transpose develops, why, and using what modes.

1343
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:43,180
There is a very strong prediction there in this field of knowledge,

1344
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:48,460
transport geography or transport economics and engineering are essentially objective sciences.

1345
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:53,180
They are much more on the side of science and sciences and humanities for example.

1346
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:56,180
They purpose being pursuing objectivity and truth.

1347
01:28:56,180 --> 01:29:01,500
It's a quote from another very important textbook on transport geography.

1348
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:06,820
The idea being that we can arrive some kind of absolute truth in terms of what is good transport

1349
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:13,140
and what is bad, which essentially are translatable, transferable from one locality to

1350
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:22,280
went out. So if we go back to the 1950s, if the US cities develop motorways and develop

1351
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:26,380
car infrastructure, which is efficient at rational, this is a solution that can also work

1352
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:32,100
in dense medieval European cities such as the ones in Belgium to just Brussels, for

1353
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,060
example.

1354
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:40,380
Crucially, this line of thinking and that maybe didn't develop in the end of the 17th

1355
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:46,120
in the 19th century, but was definitely a result of this process that I called the colonization

1356
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:53,700
of space. This field of thinking and producing transport is consolidated itself around the

1357
01:29:53,700 --> 01:30:01,460
1930s and 40s and that propelled measurements and engineering studies that allowed to construct

1358
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:08,420
these interurban and intraurban motorway systems. And this very much continues today following

1359
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:12,420
a rule of predicting demand for mobility,

1360
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:16,340
predicting passenger flows or traffic flows

1361
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:20,100
and providing necessary infrastructure for it.

1362
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,900
So basically most of transport,

1363
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:27,540
most of what transport models do is predict

1364
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:30,980
where would these flows go and provide

1365
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:35,140
essential infrastructure and extension of a road lane,

1366
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:36,740
a construction of a new motorway,

1367
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:41,140
construction of the new metro line, you name it.

1368
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:45,100
So that's one part of the rationality of transport.

1369
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:48,380
The other part is that the assumption is that the user itself

1370
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:54,780
and it's, yeah, the user itself is also a rational being.

1371
01:30:54,780 --> 01:31:01,020
It's a homo, economic, it's an economically minded being

1372
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:05,580
that almost on a regular basis, on a daily basis,

1373
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:11,300
conduct some kind of economic analysis in terms of what is an efficient way of reaching

1374
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:19,100
an destination B from point A in terms of time, in terms of cost, being, making pragmatic

1375
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:25,340
free and very much utility-based choices in terms of how to move and where to move.

1376
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:32,180
So in other words, a market, a market that is being governed by the laws of economics,

1377
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:38,340
very much in this line of thought are being compared to the loss of physics. A lot of these models

1378
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:44,660
would have, for example, illusions to gravity, so gravity, models that in a natural light way

1379
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:50,100
pulls, flows of passengers to some destinations rather than others because for example, economic

1380
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:58,100
and connectivity is present in an area. So that's principle of dogma number one. Number two is that

1381
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:06,340
But there is this very strong conviction and funny enough, still not fully proven, but the

1382
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:11,980
conviction is very much there, that investment in transport infrastructure, of course,

1383
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:13,860
that part is not controversial.

1384
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:19,140
Least of high speeds, leads to low and travel times, leads to lower transaction costs

1385
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:24,140
if you want to move from A to B or sell for some goods, it's basically cheaper, leads

1386
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,700
to economic development.

1387
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:30,080
So the better infrastructure we have, the higher or the better

1388
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,420
the growth of a locality.

1389
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:36,620
So if you want the city to be economically prosperous,

1390
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:42,580
wealthy, you need quality transport infrastructure.

1391
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:50,660
So that very much is underpinned by this quarter

1392
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:51,940
that I already mentioned earlier today,

1393
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:54,060
that the unique purpose of transport is, in fact,

1394
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:57,580
to limit, to reduce space and time that is needed

1395
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,900
to cover the space to zero,

1396
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:04,020
so that that is the unique purpose of movement in the city,

1397
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,580
which also means that the travel time itself

1398
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,660
is an unproductive activity,

1399
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,220
because from the monetary perspective,

1400
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,220
if you want to go from A to B,

1401
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:14,220
well, you want to get there as quickly as possible.

1402
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,700
The time of getting there itself

1403
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:18,100
is not a valuable activity.

1404
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:20,700
Now, there are, I mean, there was a flurry of problems here,

1405
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:23,140
starting from the fact that if you actually ask people

1406
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,940
through studies, what they do when they take the metro

1407
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:29,020
or where they cycle, which is such a complicated

1408
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,900
and multi-faceted activity.

1409
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:34,180
They often say that this is actually a very important part

1410
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:37,100
of the day, that commuting on public transport, for example,

1411
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,660
allows them to catch up with friends, to read,

1412
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:43,220
to relax, to meditate, cycling being,

1413
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:45,340
as I mentioned, multi-faceted activity

1414
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:48,100
that allows people to get relaxed, work out,

1415
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:52,380
get an endorphin kick and all that.

1416
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:57,380
And that's so much more than just moving from one place to another.

1417
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:04,500
But again, without trying to draw some kind of caricature,

1418
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:09,180
I think it's important to understand that this way of thinking about transport

1419
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:13,020
leads us to a formulation of an absolutely fundamental problem

1420
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:17,180
in inverted commons that a lot of engineers, transport engineers,

1421
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:18,780
and transport economists recognize.

1422
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:20,620
And that problem is congestion.

1423
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:25,620
if you focus on fluid flow of passengers, cars,

1424
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:28,820
whatever the transport mode is,

1425
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,380
any obstruction to that flow,

1426
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:34,540
any obstruction to that model is a problem that has to be solved.

1427
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:36,260
And that problem has to be solved

1428
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,540
because otherwise the system is irrational.

1429
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:40,060
So that's number one.

1430
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:43,220
And the second reason is that,

1431
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:46,660
unless you do that, you can

1432
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:53,700
the economic growth, economic development of the locality that you are in in in charge of.

1433
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:59,780
As I mentioned this this beneficial, supposed to be beneficial relationship between

1434
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:04,580
transport development and economic development. So better roads, I mean better transport,

1435
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:09,860
better exchange of goods and services. That of course works to some extent. I mean you can

1436
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:16,420
you can see that having theoretically at least from scratch in in many cities in many countries

1437
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:21,220
from the global south. But then this relation has never really been theorized, it's never

1438
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:27,300
really been proven. And it will be extremely difficult to make that claim in cities that

1439
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:31,860
are postmodern, such as Brussels or many other cities in the global north, but actually increasing

1440
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:37,060
the global south. So addition of infrastructure, especially road infrastructure, current

1441
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:43,700
infrastructure, and it's anticipated impact in terms of economic growth, economic development,

1442
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:49,160
It's a very controversial issue that, well, it's not really, we don't have any tangible

1443
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:55,400
proof or the tangible enough to say with certainty that this is the case.

1444
01:35:55,400 --> 01:36:01,380
But it's an argument that you can hear a lot, including in Brussels and Belgium.

1445
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,380
Is this clear?

1446
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:04,500
Do you have any questions?

1447
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:08,780
This is usually where people are scratching the hands a little bit, so I want to make

1448
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:11,820
sure that you are okay.

1449
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:19,260
nobody is running anything in a chat, no angry comments, I keep advancing here then.

1450
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:24,460
So what happens when you believe that what you do is rational and it's very important

1451
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:27,180
for society, for economy?

1452
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:34,660
Well, you essentially engage in developing more and more and more elaborate and complicated

1453
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:37,780
mathematical models that try to predict.

1454
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:39,820
not only to describe what's happening

1455
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:43,740
but actually trying to predict what is going to happen.

1456
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:46,060
What is now happening very much in the business

1457
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:48,300
of transport economics and transport engineering

1458
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,020
is modeling human behavior.

1459
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:53,540
So trying to predict where people will be interested

1460
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:55,140
in going and not anymore,

1461
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:57,420
where they are actually are heading

1462
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,380
and where these flows are being distributed

1463
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,540
in an urban environment.

1464
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:04,260
What's crucial here is that this field is extremely,

1465
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:06,140
not only extremely technical and quantitative,

1466
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:08,100
whether it's very descriptive,

1467
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:11,180
so this logic of transport supply and transport demands

1468
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:16,180
is devoid of any social, cultural, political relations.

1469
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:20,420
When I say that a transport user

1470
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,500
is homo-economic, is considered to be

1471
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:26,700
a this rational utility-based person or figure

1472
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:28,500
that makes these rational choices

1473
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,700
in terms of whether or how any issue of gender,

1474
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:36,700
an issue of class, of ethnicity, of age is at best mentioned,

1475
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:40,380
but given a very little weight,

1476
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:41,820
if we are talking about modeling,

1477
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,780
so these different aspects can be given

1478
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:46,540
different weights, given different importance,

1479
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:49,260
importance, different levels of importance.

1480
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:52,500
And these issues are quite simply not there.

1481
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,860
And of course, we will be discussing this a little bit.

1482
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:57,260
I mean, these different critical approaches,

1483
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:02,260
such as some anti-capitalist Marxist, feminist,

1484
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:06,780
and eranical theory, social theory,

1485
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:10,100
the exposure to those in engineering programs

1486
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:13,620
is close to none, which basically means

1487
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,180
that without trying to be too critical

1488
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:18,780
about their genius who are trying to do their job,

1489
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,700
basically they are really not aware

1490
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:23,340
of the complexity of social relations

1491
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,020
and spatial relations that are happening in cities.

1492
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:31,820
So everything that you've learned with David Barson Nick by now, this is simply not there.

1493
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:38,960
A city, according to this vision, is essentially a model that can be constructed,

1494
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:46,060
calculated and put in place, and you can predict what will happen tomorrow, the day after

1495
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:50,060
based on that, in any city in the world.

1496
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:58,460
Now that thinking has a very, yeah, very, very strange way of imagining the city.

1497
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:05,000
Essentially if a city is or any urban space is more of a field of application, then actually

1498
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:10,460
a site of any dynamics or conflicts or contradictions, different interests in terms of what

1499
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:13,300
should be happening in that space and that society.

1500
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,300
And I'm sure that you've all come across

1501
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:19,760
many even these drawings over similar ones

1502
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,740
from from the Go was here and his friends and allies,

1503
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:26,100
who basically imagined that this is exactly what should happen

1504
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,380
in a modern city, that these models,

1505
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:31,140
not only related to transport in this case

1506
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:33,780
also to housing or generally economic development

1507
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:36,580
should be literally applied in a city.

1508
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:39,100
So the idea there wouldn't be that

1509
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:42,220
in order to for that model to be as efficient as possible,

1510
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:45,340
everything in the city, especially its medieval,

1511
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:48,900
pre-industrial remnants would have to be raised.

1512
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,660
The city would have to become a black empty slate

1513
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:55,020
on which this model could be applied.

1514
01:39:55,020 --> 01:40:02,620
So even though this maybe wasn't its most extreme

1515
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:06,860
in the 1950s and the 1960s,

1516
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:09,700
when these urban motorways were being constructed

1517
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:13,460
when, as I showed you, urban trunks and Brussels were being put

1518
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:17,180
underground and a lot of heavy construction offers,

1519
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:19,380
destruction had to be done.

1520
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,260
This thinking is still very much applies.

1521
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:25,420
This, if you tune into engineers from construction offices

1522
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:29,980
in Brussels or elsewhere in Belgium or Northern Europe,

1523
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:35,940
the idea is that planning still has to follow some rational rules

1524
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:37,940
of solving congestion.

1525
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:40,500
in Brussels, for example, we have a Belgium-a-log stand

1526
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,000
and debate about what to do with the Ringo

1527
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,860
Brussels, the Ringo, who has to be expanded or not.

1528
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:46,820
Every single time there is an engineer talking

1529
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:50,100
on the radio and the news, what their solution would be

1530
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:51,540
is to answer to the infrastructure,

1531
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,540
because basically if you have traffic jams

1532
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:56,940
that generates lost time, that's the tremendous economy.

1533
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:58,340
You have to expand an infrastructure

1534
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:01,740
in order for the flows to be more fluid and unobstructed.

1535
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:07,260
This modern new classical thinking also,

1536
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:11,100
Well, you're thinking about fluidity of flows

1537
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:14,180
and removing barriers to these led

1538
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:16,220
to a separation of different modes of transport.

1539
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:21,220
So this is why we would have overpasses,

1540
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:23,740
food bridges that would allow

1541
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:27,180
or well separate pedestrians from cars, for example.

1542
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:32,180
So allow the cars to have a smooth space infrastructure

1543
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:35,340
for movement while pedestrians would have to

1544
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:39,200
across it over an ordinary.

1545
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:44,380
And that of course also that line of thought

1546
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,580
would be very much related or very much inspired

1547
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:49,500
also by the development of individual mobility

1548
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,980
via the car, right?

1549
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:54,780
So the car being not only this extremely free mode

1550
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,980
of transport also very rational and very fast

1551
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:58,100
while you're moving around.

1552
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:03,580
Now, we arrived to the 1970s, let's say,

1553
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:06,460
and something very important happened around that time

1554
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:09,180
Would anybody have an idea of being in the pictures?

1555
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:12,380
What, what I have in mind?

1556
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:16,260
Not change the way that we look at the car,

1557
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:19,460
the change the way we look at the transport.

1558
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:20,460
- Your prices?

1559
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:23,100
- The oil prices, I guess somebody already mentioned

1560
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,820
that in one of the classes.

1561
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:27,820
So the oil trucks in the 1970s,

1562
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,860
when first in the 1973,

1563
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:34,100
the organization of our petroleum exporting countries.

1564
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:38,000
So essentially the Persian Gulf countries in the United

1565
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,260
in Nolimbago and the 1979 Iranian revolution took place.

1566
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:45,180
That's not something that you can easily model.

1567
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,540
That's geopolitics for you.

1568
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,020
And what basically happened is that the global oil prices

1569
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:53,340
went through the roof, not maybe for a moment, for a longer time.

1570
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:56,860
And then they went down a little bit to a level

1571
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:59,500
that allowed, of course, for car-based mobility

1572
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:05,020
to continue, but what basically happened was that on a global

1573
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:09,980
scale decision makers, people who were in charge of designing

1574
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:13,740
transport infrastructure, realized that this limitless mobility

1575
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:18,980
by car has its economic cost, so all that fossil fuels might

1576
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:22,460
not be as available as they used to be.

1577
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:26,460
But also around that time began to begin some kind of,

1578
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:30,820
as moved to this slide already,

1579
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:35,660
reflection on different externalities

1580
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:38,220
are different also social and environmental costs

1581
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:41,500
that are related to carvests mobility.

1582
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:44,020
This environmental cost being, for example,

1583
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:48,140
predominantly noise, of course, accidents,

1584
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:51,940
health related issues, mostly related to pollution

1585
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:55,140
that is created by an individual cast.

1586
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:59,900
And at a run at that time,

1587
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,780
I mean, maybe it's also difficult for us to imagine,

1588
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:06,780
but until the 1970s, the idea that a car has to be efficient

1589
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,540
in terms of its fuel consumption,

1590
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:12,220
not has to be safe in terms of making sure that if it hits,

1591
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:14,860
other vehicles or if it hits pedestrians or cyclists

1592
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:17,820
it has to be more or less safe

1593
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:20,780
and there are these different areas of the car

1594
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:24,140
that absorb the energy of the impact.

1595
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:27,540
That was all essentially not the day

1596
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:29,260
with some exceptions.

1597
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:32,660
A car was the cars were not efficient

1598
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,980
from the economic perspective,

1599
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:36,860
from the environment of the perspective either.

1600
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:42,300
What changed is that, well,

1601
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:44,220
I'm again moving very fast

1602
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:46,900
in these developments.

1603
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:50,340
What changed is that there was first a reflection

1604
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:53,060
on the environmental impact of the car itself.

1605
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:56,340
And the general reflection on the questions

1606
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:58,100
to sustainable development of development

1607
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:02,460
that allows future generations to benefit

1608
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:04,620
from the same resources from the same opportunities

1609
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:07,660
that we are benefiting from today.

1610
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:10,940
So some kind of beginning of a reflection

1611
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:14,260
in terms of the planetary limits of the growth

1612
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:16,060
that our societies are,

1613
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,260
of the societies at the time where we're engaging in.

1614
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:25,140
And also an idea that cities are absolutely crucial

1615
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:28,980
for that in that process that in order

1616
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:32,340
to arrive with sustainability of the development

1617
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:36,620
of the planetary level, cities have to also be

1618
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:40,100
transformed in order to become more sustainable.

1619
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:47,140
Why is that important that we arrive to today

1620
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:49,100
to contemporary situation?

1621
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:54,100
Well, it's important, and this is, as also the title says,

1622
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:59,660
this is the, let's say, another set of also very dominant

1623
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:01,860
and very, very important,

1624
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:04,620
and I was hegemonic perspectives on transport,

1625
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:06,340
sustainable transport.

1626
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:08,860
This is because transport is recognized today.

1627
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:12,060
It's one of the most important sources of contributions

1628
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:12,900
to pollution here.

1629
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:17,620
We see that it's at least 14% of CO2 emissions

1630
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:21,260
on the global scale as the direct emissions.

1631
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:25,340
And also, while the graph, I would say that it's a little bit

1632
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:28,700
controversial because you also could add much more in terms of the

1633
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:32,620
different other related cost of construction and the way

1634
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:36,420
that housing is constructed as a function of availability of

1635
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:39,980
transport. But let's say we stick to the 40% of global emissions

1636
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:43,580
being related directly to transport, which makes transport one of

1637
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:46,820
Well, here I'm a little bit wrong.

1638
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:48,780
That is the largest single source of global transport

1639
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:52,620
emissions because you immediately see that industry is at 21%.

1640
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:55,260
We also boiled to different sectors and all that.

1641
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:57,060
But what's very important with transport

1642
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,460
is that this definitely one of the fastest,

1643
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:03,580
it's not the fastest rising contributor to emissions.

1644
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:05,820
So every year increases the highest among all

1645
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:07,460
the economic sectors globally.

1646
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:10,660
So global climate problems are essentially

1647
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:12,900
increasingly transport problems.

1648
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:16,580
This is, let's say, we may not point of departure,

1649
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:18,980
but one of the main reflections of this perspective

1650
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:20,020
on the issue.

1651
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:23,500
What also is very important is that,

1652
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,060
as you see on the left hand side,

1653
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:29,260
the global proportion of people living in urban communities

1654
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:30,180
is rising.

1655
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:35,180
So if in 2010, we were already after this magic

1656
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:39,020
threshold of 50% or more of people living in cities

1657
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:40,900
as opposed to the countryside.

1658
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:48,900
In 2030, the projection is that it will be 60% of people living in cities and that will go up to at least 67 in 2050.

1659
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:54,900
Of course, this is a mantra that I'm sure that at least those of you who follow the master in urban studies have already heard before.

1660
01:47:54,900 --> 01:48:03,900
We are living in urban society that's, you know, our planet is essentially an urban, an urban planet, planetary urbanization.

1661
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:07,900
There's a lot of concepts flying around.

1662
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:14,540
But it's important and it is a fact that increasingly the global population becoming more

1663
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:19,140
and more urban, it's in the cities that a lot of these problems will have to be addressed.

1664
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:23,340
So the urban mobility is not only that transport is crucial for solving the climate

1665
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:28,540
crisis, but it's the urban transport that constitutes definitely a very important challenge

1666
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:30,540
that has to be addressed.

1667
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:36,940
So we see that as the right-hand side-craft, that urban mobility, the Manfob, and mobility

1668
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:42,540
is rising almost exponentially. And that's expressed in trillions of kilometres per year here,

1669
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:54,860
it rose from 2010 to 2030 by 68%. Now we might think that with all the reflection on externalities

1670
01:48:54,860 --> 01:49:01,180
that cars have, and produce the environmental and social aspects that are very detrimental to

1671
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:09,580
to our lives, that we are moving away from the car. This is a perspective that we already had a short

1672
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:14,300
charge on that. There is a shift. We start to look at urban spaces a little bit differently. We

1673
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:20,540
want less cars to be present in it. But in fact on a global scale, if you look at the on the left

1674
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:28,380
hand side as a cumulative figure, so the global number of all registered cars, the rise is ongoing

1675
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:36,620
and it's huge. And that's also seen in the graph on the right hand side where we see

1676
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:43,660
non-commulative yearly amount of cars being sold on a global scale. So we see that every year

1677
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:49,500
the amount of cars being sold is rising 2019 being some sort of an exception. We have a little

1678
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:56,060
bit of a drop. But what the graph doesn't not show is the amount of SUV, so the sports utility

1679
01:49:56,060 --> 01:50:01,260
vehicles they are called, which went through the roof in 2018 and 2019.

1680
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:05,900
Their contribution environment is speaking much higher, a few times higher than regular

1681
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:07,060
vehicles.

1682
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:12,860
What also you can see over there is that in orange, if you see that the contribution, which

1683
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:17,820
can call it this way of the European Union countries in terms of the number of cars sold,

1684
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,060
is more or less stable.

1685
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:22,500
So here we don't see an important price.

1686
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:30,180
If you look at India in grey and in China in blue, here the difference between 2005 and

1687
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:32,780
2019 is significant.

1688
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:38,340
So there is a lot of economies, some call them developing economies, I'm not really a fan

1689
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:44,620
of the word, but a lot of nation states, a lot of societies where the levels of motorizations

1690
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:51,380
were relatively low and this commodity is definitely becoming more and more available.

1691
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:56,420
It's not exactly the same process that was happening in Northern Europe or North America,

1692
01:50:56,420 --> 01:51:02,940
or Western Europe or North America in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, but it's definitely a

1693
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:08,100
steep rise of modernization, of mobility levels, which raises a lot of environmental

1694
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:15,060
questions, but also ethical issues in terms of whether this is something that we now

1695
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:20,460
with our Western Northern ISA, looking at very critically, in fact, it's something that

1696
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:23,500
these people, these societies have the right to engage in it.

1697
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,300
As we did, it was our parents,

1698
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:28,780
our grandparents did some decades ago.

1699
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:31,180
But what is very important here,

1700
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:32,540
I'm going to skip this one slide,

1701
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:37,740
is that this debate, if we can put it this way, shifts its attention.

1702
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:41,180
So we're moving away from the problem of congestion,

1703
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:45,340
the problem of unobstructed flows,

1704
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:49,100
the problem of rationality, the problem of economic development.

1705
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:55,340
We see that this economic development has its environmental

1706
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:57,500
price, if we can put it this way.

1707
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:02,100
And a very important and very pertinent symbol of that mobility

1708
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,580
and transport is the car.

1709
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:09,980
As the important contributor to that cake, in terms

1710
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:16,100
of pollution, in terms of externalities of transport.

1711
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:21,300
And next time, so we still have a bit time for questions, maybe discussion,

1712
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:27,300
we're going to talk about specific examples of how transport develops along this line of thought.

1713
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:33,860
But, and I think it will be, well, it's definitely not the only thing we're going to do,

1714
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:40,820
because as I will also explain in a week, that perspective also is extremely limited in its lack of

1715
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:44,660
and social and also spatial understanding of the city.

1716
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:47,820
So a simple critique of the car as the problem

1717
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:51,380
is also leading us into a number of traps,

1718
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:56,380
which mean that our understanding of how people enjoy

1719
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:59,900
or do not enjoy mobility because of the class,

1720
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:02,700
the gender, the ethnicity, and many other factors

1721
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:04,780
is extremely limited.

1722
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:08,580
So I put a little bit of a car here.

1723
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:11,860
I wonder if you have any questions,

1724
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:14,340
any points of discussion.

1725
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:15,980
We still have 12 minutes,

1726
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,780
so we might as well use them.

1727
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:29,100
- I might try to initiate a little discussion here

1728
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:33,540
about popularity of cars and

1729
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:38,140
endless mess that we are now seeing

1730
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:43,140
of a lifestyle on high speed and etc.

1731
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:51,380
I observed a curious thing that on TV in Belgium,

1732
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:53,340
at least, I don't usually watch TV,

1733
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:58,340
but I happened to watch 41 night with my friend

1734
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:04,580
like a generic Belgium program.

1735
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:09,820
during the advertisement period, all the odds,

1736
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:14,300
a vast majority of them were about cars.

1737
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:19,300
And in all ways, they were trying to sell either lifestyle,

1738
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:26,500
a ecological idea that new cars can be in the green,

1739
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:33,020
et cetera, but I was wondering if we might ever arrive

1740
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:41,260
to this thinking that we should not be advertising this anymore,

1741
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:50,380
as we don't advertise cigarettes or alcohol on TV and media,

1742
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:54,780
in whether that makes sense or doesn't.

1743
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:57,940
It's an interesting thought.

1744
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,980
We will actually come back to it next time,

1745
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:02,780
but they wonder if somebody has already, you know,

1746
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:07,180
an opinion on this, should advertising cars

1747
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:09,860
or sale cars should be banned because it's

1748
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:11,300
but for society.

1749
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:22,860
And we're going to give an ad to this

1750
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:27,300
that I've been watching Belgian TV for a long time

1751
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:28,660
as I'm saying, Belgian.

1752
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:33,940
And there always used to be park commercials,

1753
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:38,100
but in the last two years, actually most of them

1754
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:45,580
have been for SUV cars, or like there's been a bit shift

1755
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:49,780
to making commercials for SUV cars, which I

1756
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:51,620
have found really strange.

1757
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:59,940
- Well, yeah, I think it's happening.

1758
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:01,380
I was considering to put another graph

1759
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:03,820
that shows the increase of SUV sales in the really,

1760
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:06,380
maybe before 2015, it was,

1761
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:07,940
this market hardly existed.

1762
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:11,820
It really became a thing in the last two years,

1763
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:14,260
at least in Western Europe.

1764
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:15,820
I think it was a little bit different

1765
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:18,660
in Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine,

1766
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:24,420
some cultural reasons also really bad roads

1767
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:26,180
and a lot of rich people.

1768
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:32,420
But, okay, but that seems that if you tune in

1769
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:34,700
to the mainstream culture, if you show TV

1770
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:37,340
and advertising in between programs,

1771
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:38,940
the cars are still very much there.

1772
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:42,340
Well, maybe not regular cars, but more SUVs, as you say.

1773
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:47,820
I think it's an interesting observation.

1774
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:51,340
Anybody else has some thoughts on this or another things?

1775
01:56:51,340 --> 01:57:06,140
I think it would be quite hard to prohibit the advertisements if there's no real alternative

1776
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:13,380
for the car, for example, in flanders, yeah, there's an extreme suburbanization and its

1777
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:24,100
mobility is not that good to get to different places such as work or leisure. So yeah, I think first

1778
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:30,340
a better alternative for the car needs to be installed. And what is that alternative?

1779
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:42,340
Yeah, maybe better public transport, safer also in cities, but also in just down safer bicycle

1780
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:44,820
lanes or, yeah.

1781
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:51,260
And yes, like car sharing more,

1782
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:53,700
if not really an alternative for cars,

1783
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:58,460
it may be less having each household having two cars

1784
01:57:58,460 --> 01:57:59,460
or three.

1785
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:02,540
And in Belgium, there's also the big problem

1786
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:07,540
of the companies having giving cars to their employees,

1787
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:12,780
which has sparked the bait.

1788
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:16,180
- Yes, in Belgium in fact,

1789
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:18,500
most of new cars being sold,

1790
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:20,140
a so-called company cars, which are

1791
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:22,660
paid for by the,

1792
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:23,900
I mean, for those who do not know

1793
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:25,140
who are not from Belgium,

1794
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:28,580
it's a system that allows you to get a free car

1795
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:29,900
from your employer,

1796
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:33,020
and it's basically a way of giving somebody a salary bump

1797
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:37,420
because a tax free bonus,

1798
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:39,180
if you increase somebody's salary,

1799
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:46,860
would have to pay tax on this. You don't pay tax on the company car. But then why do you think

1800
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:53,980
people, well, because it seems that I described some kind of a shift of thinking and some

1801
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:58,300
reflection on these environmental problems that the corporate uses and all the new

1802
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:03,260
senses that it causes, but it seems that people still drive. Why do you think they still do it?

1803
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:07,660
Why is it still so popular?

1804
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:14,220
Maybe I can refer to this. I think there's like

1805
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:19,260
exactly what you were talking about before like certain

1806
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:23,260
yeah certain

1807
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:27,420
factors which which cannot be

1808
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:38,060
somehow persist before like like our planners cannot um sorry um like you

1809
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:42,300
certain things you cannot plan and like it's an individual approach that

1810
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:47,340
the symbol of the car is still like deep in the mind of a lot of people that they

1811
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:55,740
it's like a day routine that you get into your car and drive to the to your

1812
01:59:55,740 --> 02:00:03,180
working place. And I think that's exactly the problem that it's certain changes in the transportation

1813
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:10,940
system cannot be made by planners or transport transportation planners, but have to be made in

1814
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:19,660
in the society or in the symbolism of a car. So it's a mindset, it's some cultural

1815
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:28,540
How do we choose sociologists would say that's a way of imagining how we interact with the world or how we move through it?

1816
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:35,540
But I think the example of the company power also shows it something else. It's not exclusive. That is also a policy.

1817
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:39,540
That there are a number of political instruments that make it.

1818
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:48,540
I mean, if we go with that simplified logic of making a rational economic choice,

1819
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:51,180
How do I go and what do I go?

1820
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:55,100
It simply makes this decision more simple, more rational.

1821
02:00:55,100 --> 02:01:01,180
It makes sense to have a car from an economic perspective as well, in many cities still.

1822
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:12,460
If I could maybe add to that also that's structurally, there is a lot of government as well,

1823
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:18,300
policy support not just like the company cars, but as we saw these days with the crisis,

1824
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:24,940
I think to try to boost, not to allow our automobile manufacturing, automobile companies,

1825
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:29,660
crumble because of the employment opportunities that they provide. So,

1826
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:35,580
strangely enough, actually some of the financial loss or some of the new

1827
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:42,540
funds for the stimulate the economy have been directly towards individual car owners

1828
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:49,100
purchase of different people. So I think when you when you see that it's

1829
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:55,100
being imperative a big push if you can have access to that as well.

1830
02:01:55,100 --> 02:02:00,460
Yeah. I think singles with aviation, I don't know if you follow the London news, but

1831
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:05,500
one of the first, maybe not first, but one of the only discussions in terms of some economic

1832
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:11,660
package for stimulating the economy in Belgium was towards the aviation companies.

1833
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:17,020
The argument being is that these industries create jobs and these jobs are valuable.

1834
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:21,740
Well, I'm not saying whether this is right or wrong,

1835
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:27,900
but the argument is there that these modes of mobility also produce employment.

1836
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:33,100
I think that relates a little bit to this aspect of economic development, this anticipation,

1837
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:39,980
that this way of moving around our cities or societies in general is very important for the economy

1838
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:43,020
to keep growing, to keep persisting.

1839
02:02:43,020 --> 02:02:49,260
Are there any other comments? We're from some people who haven't spoken yet.

1840
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:51,580
Do you have some thoughts?

1841
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:53,500
Some comments?

1842
02:02:53,500 --> 02:03:00,300
I was also thinking about security. The use of the car is still

1843
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:08,460
Like, yeah, done by many because maybe it's the most secure way of moving around in some cities.

1844
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:14,380
And also, like, as I'm thinking, like, as a woman, as a girl, like, moving around the city at night,

1845
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:19,500
usually like, I mean, not here in Brussels because I don't have a car here in Brussels, like, back home.

1846
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:28,700
I would go by car at night. Just because like, yeah, it's not very secure to move around with,

1847
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:34,300
like probably transport or even by bike. So I would say like yeah it's a matter of security as well.

1848
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:43,260
And it's more like a structure problem to change so I guess more steps have to be taken in that sense.

1849
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:51,660
Yeah it's a very good point. It's existed before the pandemic and now it's become even more

1850
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:59,020
more of an issue. So any data shows us that, especially the upper middle class or upper class

1851
02:03:59,020 --> 02:04:06,060
people have bought themselves a new car to separate themselves from the danger of interacting with

1852
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:11,820
others. And this danger would be related to maybe criminality or general lack of safety, especially

1853
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:17,820
at night, especially for women perhaps. But now this sense of danger and the car is this kind of

1854
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:24,540
bubble that allows you to separate yourself from whatever danger society holds, it's even stronger.

1855
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:34,060
I think what's important also, we will talk about this a lot next time, is that this goes

1856
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:40,140
very differently for different people. I mean it sounds very obvious, but whether you look at

1857
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:44,140
the situation from a class perspective or from a gender perspective or from a racial perspective,

1858
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:49,660
I think all these three also ages very important. All these four then

1859
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:55,580
the blind person is very much. The way that people arrive through a decision in terms of

1860
02:04:55,580 --> 02:05:00,940
why they go where they go and how they go, it's very different from cluster class from

1861
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:08,460
gendered gender etc etc. So this homo-economic paradigm is extremely problematic there.

1862
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:17,100
But so is, I hope I will convince you of that, this direct critique of the car,

1863
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:23,340
because different people use the car for different reasons. And not always, it's an individual choice,

1864
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:30,540
but also there are some structural issues that play, also indeed, some cultural inertia,

1865
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:38,780
some ways of being that were installed and promoted for decades, which now we are of some of us.

1866
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:46,140
living in city centres, critical of things are quite different if you're from a

1867
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:51,460
different class and living in different areas of the city. I don't mind taking one

1868
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:55,500
more or two more questions but it's age already so we are very free to leave

1869
02:05:55,500 --> 02:06:00,180
if you want to. I don't want to take too much of your time.

1870
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:05,540
Well, great.

1871
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:09,540
I'm glad this is working from the technical perspective at least.

1872
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:13,540
Yeah, I will see you next week.

1873
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:16,540
Can I add a last question?

1874
02:06:16,540 --> 02:06:17,540
Yeah, yeah.

1875
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:21,540
The last question about the excursion that we have program.

1876
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:25,540
I know that in COVID times, well, it's not happening.

1877
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:28,540
No, no, I was told that, yeah,

1878
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:33,180
was trying to do it, but it's not possible, unfortunately.

1879
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:34,740
I wish we could do it.

1880
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:37,620
The idea is for those of you who are in Brussels next semester,

1881
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:39,380
but all of you will be, right?

1882
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:49,620
Well, I mean, let's say, well, we don't know, of course,

1883
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:50,460
what happens in a few months.

1884
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:54,300
But the idea is that if in spring, we are more or less

1885
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:57,060
to more into face-to-face meetings,

1886
02:06:57,060 --> 02:07:02,340
we do the excursion then. We imagined with David Bas another is what would happen if we meet with

1887
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:07,620
40 people and tried to keep distance. I think this would you know we would hit YouTube very quickly

1888
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:14,660
I think trying to walk through the city in this arrangement. So no and also in December I mean it

1889
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:20,180
would be very strange. From ice greens in the end we would definitely try to keep together

1890
02:07:20,180 --> 02:07:26,820
just to keep warm. It's cold right? So we will do that in spring I hope. It's a nice excursion.

1891
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:33,060
from what I've heard. People usually enjoy it. Even though it's only about transport.

1892
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:41,300
But yeah, I'm sorry about that. I wish we could do it. Yeah, this is the reality we're living in.

1893
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:49,380
I hope you've got a great rest of the week. I'll see you all next week. The links are there,

1894
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:53,220
So it seems that everything is clear and working. So that's brilliant.

1895
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:58,260
Enjoy and have a good, have a good week.

1896
02:07:58,260 --> 02:08:00,740
Thank you for the lecture.

1897
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:04,100

# 9 Critical perspectives on urban transport

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
to be recording automatically, but it is now.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,080
Thanks for reminding me.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
So double rationality, the rationality of the discipline,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,640
which is taken as some kind of field

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,680
deriving from natural sciences, alluding to laws of physics,

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,280
which apparently help to understand where people go,

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,480
how they move around the city.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,680
and the rationality of the people themselves,

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,280
of the users, of passengers, drivers,

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,360
who make rational, economic choices

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,800
in terms of where they go, how they go.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,360
How does this apply to the city?

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,160
Well, basically the city's approach as a clean slate.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,040
So it's social, political, spatial complexity.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,800
It's seen, if it is seen, it's seen as an obstacle

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,160
to these principles of rational planning.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,200
If it's not seen, then basically, well,

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,440
this planning is applied as if on a clean slate,

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,840
which in this particular slide,

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,440
maybe this is a bit of an exaggeration.

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,800
He's a plant from the Copusia,

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,240
who was really very back then,

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,720
and was called the Boul, the courageous,

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,440
in terms of proposing to actually

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,400
demolish all the neighborhoods

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,320
or all cities to give way to this rational modern planning.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,560
But a lot of these planning principles have been applied,

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,120
I'm sure that you've been to, maybe even lived in cities

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,040
where whole neighborhoods, if not whole cities,

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,720
have been designed according to this principle

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,520
of rationality, speed, modernity.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,240
That of course focused on, or framed the car,

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,240
the private vehicle as the ultimate,

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,840
most rational, most liberating mode of mobility,

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
mode of transport.

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,960
We also arrived last time to this growing reflection,

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,680
starting from the 1970s and then through the 1980s and 1990s,

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,920
on many different problems related to car

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
and automobileities.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,000
So there's wider social phenomenon related

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,520
to a classification and commodification of private cars.

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,600
So a lot of social issues have been raised

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,480
and primarily environmental issues,

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,160
second-rate with regards to automobileity

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,760
with regard to the car.

46
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,440
And to be frank,

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:31,200
I think in a lot of transport debates, whether in academia or on activism or in policy,

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,800
you in Brussels I think is quite apparent in many other Belgian cities too.

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
This is where we are.

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,720
This is still very much the dominant paradigm in terms of how policy is being framed and

51
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
how research is being done.

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,440
Paris considered to be something detrimental to the quality of urban space, to living,

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,840
because of its environmental effects,

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,680
the pollution, noise, accidents, that it causes,

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,000
it's a very dangerous mode of transport.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,080
For those, of course, who are outside of the car

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,800
and clash, collide with it.

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,480
Or it's spatial footprints, right?

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,360
So the spatial impact of the infrastructure,

60
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,200
the amount of square meters that have to be devoted

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,560
to this particular mode of transport,

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,080
nor the for it, to be able to move around the city.

63
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,000
So I'm thinking here,

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,600
but all there have been multiple ways, the parking lots,

65
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,640
junctions and all that that has to be present

66
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,640
in the city for the car to be a valid,

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,200
useful of moving around.

68
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,960
So this is what we did last time.

69
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,760
A bit of an, I'm not an introvert,

70
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
but what happened also,

71
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,480
throughout the 1970s and '80s,

72
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,240
is that in the global north, at least,

73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,920
in so-called developed countries,

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,760
such as Belgium, but also across the point in North America.

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,480
Cities have entered into a post-40s era,

76
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,520
and I'm sure this has been covered a lot by David

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,400
and probably a little bit by Nick.

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,120
And here I'm going to focus much more

79
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,560
on the transport related impact of that shift.

80
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,200
Of course, it was not something that happened over a day

81
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,280
and it's difficult to tell or to pinpoint

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,280
when did 40 cities conclude the existence,

83
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,240
and we moved to post-40 and there's more of a longer process

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,920
that happened over a long period of time,

85
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,640
at least a couple of years, if not decades.

86
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,320
But what's very important there is that if you go back

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,000
to these curves and that are somewhat similar

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,160
to the contractives, waves of different innovation waves.

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,680
1960s, '70s and '80s brought first the innovation

90
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,560
and then the massification, the spread of ICT technology.

91
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,240
So different modes of different instruments

92
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,960
of telecommunication, and also a big development

93
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,200
of aviation of air, which was used both.

94
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,800
I mean, of course, it existed already in 1930s,

95
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,480
40s and 50s, but it's in the 1970s

96
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,320
that it really became a common or more common than ever

97
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,760
way for people to move around to travel, of course,

98
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,200
not within the city, but between cities and countries,

99
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,240
and also to move goods.

100
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,440
So this really propelled or gave constitute

101
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,440
a really big step in terms of globalizing both traffic of people as an of goods or trade.

102
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,160
And that's coincided with a general shift from industrial to service economy,

103
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,720
ongoing sub-organization of not only housing but also a number of other economic functions that

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,840
were traditionally related to them because also moved to the suburbs, which created

105
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,320
polycentric mosaic-like patterns of suburbanization. So the suburbs were no longer

106
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,960
these residential areas from which people committed to the city center, but actually a lot of jobs,

107
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,280
a lot of productive activity and service economy would start being located in the suburbs themselves.

108
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,480
So creating all kinds of constellations, which for example could be called the suburban downtown,

109
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,000
so H-Cities that comes from the work of a famous job of a soldier,

110
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,960
analyzing the development of Los Angeles in the 1980s and the 1990s.

111
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:17,080
The paradigm of this could be seen, I mean, or the symbol, not a paradigm of this transformation

112
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,560
could be seen in the particular space or a type of space of an airport. If back in the 1970s,

113
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,760
as you can see in this image, the airport would be a very functional place, a place of arrival,

114
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:36,760
the departure and around the small area would be devoted to the airport. This over, of course,

115
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,240
a number of decades has completely changed. So you see that development of one of the most

116
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,040
important efforts in the world's people, which is the airport of Amsterdam. What's very important

117
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:54,280
here is that the airport is no longer in addition to the city but actually increasingly a central

118
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,160
space around which or in relation to which the city develops.

119
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,320
So what kind of a city has, what kind of an upwards city has,

120
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,680
has repercussions in terms of what kind of class of investors

121
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,040
and productive activities it can attract.

122
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,820
To have an important airport hub is increasingly

123
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,040
only, well, it's already a well-established point

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,960
of the agenda of open marketing of open development.

125
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,200
And airports are no longer just airports.

126
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,480
when you can see here in the slide that around C-pop,

127
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,000
we've got a number of other activities.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So business district, office spaces, residential hotel.

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,640
So it is sort of neighborhood in itself

130
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,760
that is built around the airport itself.

131
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,840
This is important, why is it important?

132
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,120
Well, there is a number of things at stake here,

133
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,240
but the most important thing here is that this change

134
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,640
of typology of different spaces and relation to these different modes of travel.

135
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,240
So, coming into telecommunications, aviation means that travel patterns are becoming more

136
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,880
and more complex.

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,000
The globalization of world economy and the centrality of the city and global economy means

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,120
that there is a number of productive activities jobs basically that have in 24/7.

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,440
It's the paradigm of going to, I mean, of most people going to work at eight o'clock,

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,600
in the morning and then going back in the afternoon, of course, it's a lot of people still

141
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,880
do that, but there is plenty of jobs that happen overnight that require transporting

142
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,040
infrastructure that is provided in places and at times that were not needed, there was no

143
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:44,760
demand for in the past. So in other words, this making of the urban economy more flexible

144
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,720
and more precarious has repercussions in terms of making transport and mobility also much

145
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,040
much more flexible or the demand for, much more flexible,

146
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,720
way of moving, which of course means that it's way more complicated and way more difficult

147
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,640
to design transport systems than before.

148
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,520
Since people move, if we can put it in a very blunt way, in much more complicated ways than

149
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,080
ever before, at very different times, in different spaces.

150
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,120
Just to give you an example, I mean, traditionally, there's haven't been, so the

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,840
airport of Brussels will be considered, of course, as a very important space that had to

152
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,520
be connected to the city, primarily to receive passengers

153
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,560
there and from.

154
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,000
And increasingly, around that area of the city--

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,120
and I think you covered that with David, quite in detail--

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
there is a whole hub of business and productive activity,

157
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,360
which of course attracts a lot of middle class workers

158
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,360
who would go to that area daytime.

159
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,440
But then the development of the city--

160
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,840
sorry, of the airport--

161
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,440
means that there is a high demand for workers

162
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,640
and logistics, for example.

163
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,240
I have to arrive at the airport at 3 o'clock in the morning, which raises questions in terms of provision of public transport to the area.

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,240
A lot of these people would, for example, reside in working-class neighborhoods of Brussels.

165
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,940
So there is a question where the night-time public transport should be provided to the area,

166
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,140
but then get the current paradigm of public transport by nighttime in Brussels.

167
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,640
This mode of transport is mostly provided for leisure activities.

168
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,000
So for people who go out and enjoy cultural activities

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
or socializing and want to go back home

170
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,560
and do a clock three o'clock in the night.

171
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,520
But not for people who actually need to reach

172
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,240
they jobs at that time of the night.

173
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,440
In very, let's say weird or previously

174
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,880
not so present areas such as the sub-item area

175
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,720
or other locala fees around that and that's not that hard.

176
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,040
Okay.

177
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,000
So having said this,

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,960
So a quick reminder of what we did last time

179
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,920
and a quick cover of this shift from four this to post four

180
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,120
is the paradigm of urban development

181
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,840
and its repercussions for the cities

182
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,400
and transport in them.

183
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,520
Here's what we are going to do today.

184
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,040
So we will discuss perhaps have a little discussion.

185
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,280
Actually, I'll be trying to ask you some questions

186
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,040
and engage in some exchange here.

187
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,320
What is the sustainable urban transport

188
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,760
different sustainable perspectives on imagining transport and developing it.

189
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,360
And then we will engage in a progressive deconstructing of the paradigm and analyze what we

190
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,080
can identify as critical approaches to transport it, mobility that built on a number of

191
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,480
perspectives that you already heard from David and Bass and Nick about.

192
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,680
All right.

193
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,400
Last week, what you had to do, and many other things that are done out of you had to do

194
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,280
with students of Master of Nursing Studies and Geography,

195
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,840
is to read paper by David Bannister on Sustainable Mobility

196
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,120
Partly.

197
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,840
I wonder whether you still remember anything from that paper.

198
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,080
This is not an exam, so don't worry if you remember things

199
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,040
that were not exactly what you remember,

200
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
but it's exactly clear, maybe things a little bit fuzzy.

201
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,560
But does something ring a bell from that piece?

202
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,880
If somebody asked you today before this particular lecture,

203
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,320
what is sustainable urban transport?

204
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,480
What comes to mind?

205
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,680
Does anybody want to share the thoughts on this with us?

206
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:19,240
That's a cool look with silence.

207
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,040
Come on, does anybody remember what

208
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,440
a banister says in this paper?

209
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,000
That's all right.

210
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,640
Okay, well, it's not how to put it.

211
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,280
It's not the most fascinating paper I've ever read,

212
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,040
but for transport geography, it's absolutely fundamental.

213
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,000
So this is really something that you see being referred

214
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,440
to for what was it written 2011, right?

215
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,440
So nine years in this is still a very, very important piece

216
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,960
of writing that really defined almost a whole field

217
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,880
of research and transport in mobility.

218
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,040
What's important here-- and this is important when

219
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,760
we keep thinking about the last lecture

220
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,280
in the neoclassical paradigm of developing transport--

221
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,760
is, well, could be summarized in the number of parts.

222
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,880
So if you think about this image that I showed you

223
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,160
from the corpus year, and this modernist rational approach

224
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,560
to planning cities around transport,

225
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,180
Here, the assumption is that we have to ultimately break with the small

226
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,700
function of planning, separation of functions, keeping residential areas on the one side,

227
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,100
and productive activity jobs, offices, industrial activity,

228
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,540
on the other side, and then leisure somewhere in between these three,

229
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,660
in between these two. Here, the idea is that we really have to

230
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,980
engage in planning cities that are much more mixed, which different functions are

231
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,660
allocated much more closely to each other. Why do we have to do that? Well, because this increases

232
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:13,260
a possibility of engaging less in mobility, of basically moving less in the city, which has of course

233
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,420
very good implications or potentially good implications in terms of the environmental impact of

234
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,940
transport. So the idea is that if we make cities more mixed, in terms of the functions, and on

235
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,460
top of that more dense, we might arrive at a situation in which people don't have to travel such

236
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,500
for our distances, all they don't have to travel that often.

237
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,820
And potentially, and that's the second point,

238
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,780
we can also facilitate some kind of a shift

239
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,580
from the mode that we all want to disappear.

240
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,380
I'm thinking as a sustainable urban transport plan

241
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,820
right now.

242
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,900
So the car towards public transport, collective mobility,

243
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,380
on the one hand, and on the other hand,

244
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,980
so-called soft transport mode.

245
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,660
So walking, cycling, to profoundly challenge

246
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,660
and hopefully end the domination of class in cities.

247
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,660
So this is, it goes beyond the critique of the car.

248
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,660
How do we, maybe not get rid of the car,

249
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,660
but how do we limit its presence?

250
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
Well, we make cities more dense, more mixed,

251
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,660
and we make public transport

252
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,660
and other different modes of moving around more attractive.

253
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,660
Well, of course, there are important cultural

254
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,660
and social barriers to this.

255
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,660
So there is some kind of social inertia

256
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,760
and you mentioned it in our discussion at the end of the last lecture,

257
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,140
people are used to driving.

258
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,580
They, of course, had been also told for a couple of decades.

259
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,380
Now that I mean buying a car is something not only perfectly normal,

260
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,100
but maybe in context such as Belgium or Brussels,

261
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,180
a perfectly rational choice.

262
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,780
Also, well, if we follow the neoclassical line,

263
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,260
I mean people make rational economic choices.

264
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:53,100
It's been simply quite profitable and economically reasonable to have a car.

265
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,260
So to instigate some kind of a social transformation,

266
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,780
we need to pay more attention to how people make these choices.

267
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,500
And this perspective starts adding a number of psychological analysis, for example,

268
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:12,220
in fact, to this equation. So it's not only an economic choice in some kind of an economic

269
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,300
decision that people make when they take a car or some other amount of transport,

270
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:23,260
But there's also different social aspects, psychological aspects that impact,

271
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,540
that make an impact on this. And this means that sustainable urban transport scholars, planners,

272
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,220
activists are much more attentive than the neoclassical colleagues in terms of how people

273
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,940
engage in different lifestyles, why do they practice certain travel behaviors that is called,

274
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,500
which also leads to a lot of studies on inclusion and transport or exclusion from it on accessibility,

275
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,860
the two different transport modes or accessibility

276
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,380
through transport to different urban functions,

277
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,180
which progressively over the 1990s, 2000s,

278
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,620
and after today, questions this paradigm of seems

279
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,420
to question this paradigm of top down planning and policy.

280
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,780
So this figure of some neoclassical rational expert

281
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,980
is not necessarily what it's still there,

282
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,940
but it's not the only god-like figure

283
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,860
that made these liquor who see a life decisions

284
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,060
in terms of, here we will go the motorway,

285
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,260
and here we will build some residential neighborhood

286
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,100
et cetera et cetera.

287
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,980
Where is the city in this paradigm or in this perspective?

288
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Well, the city is an outcome of the sustainable

289
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,540
transport paradigm.

290
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,060
It's a sustainable transport in sustainable city

291
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:46,060
is an integral component of what Jacob's calls good city

292
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,820
or what David Bannister in the article he had to read,

293
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,820
identifies as urban viability, vibrancy, vitality.

294
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,340
There is a lot of words about a lot of writing about

295
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,460
the attractiveness of the city or its livability

296
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,900
or its resilience, that's a bit more recent.

297
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,900
So there's a lot of keywords which identify a city as

298
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,180
ultimate benefactor of this shift

299
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,700
towards sustainable transport.

300
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,060
So there is talk about maintaining economic performance

301
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,140
of the city since, well, we remember that

302
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,860
new classical scholars have essentially tried

303
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,700
to theorize this relationship between economic growth

304
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,180
and development of transport.

305
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,020
So it's still there.

306
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,220
We move away from the carbon.

307
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,660
So the cities still continue to develop.

308
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,620
The economy is continue to thrive.

309
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,380
which you've social cohesion so presumably everybody is on board,

310
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,220
there is no loses of this process.

311
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,340
It's all, of course, environmentally friendly.

312
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,940
We arrive at urban environments which provide better health

313
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,540
environments or not facilities, but basically more healthy

314
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,260
for the residents.

315
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,940
And all this in the spirit of participation,

316
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,980
so everybody is on board and this political process

317
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,060
does not exclude anybody.

318
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,340
Well, if you think about this, I mean,

319
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,020
I'm, no, my intention is not to be ironic here.

320
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,300
I think that, by the way, the slide,

321
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,620
I mean, the image here is from this visualization

322
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,220
of Boula Varnspak in Brussels,

323
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,180
so the central avenue that crosses the Pentagon

324
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,620
from North to South.

325
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,740
And if you remember how this street looked like

326
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,820
some years ago, this kind of vision is something

327
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,660
that we might all want to subscribe to.

328
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,100
I mean, who doesn't want to live in a city that is all these things economically performing

329
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,000
and socially cohesive environment friendly?

330
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,020
I mean, it's a perfect city to see.

331
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:47,220
The problem is, well, before we move to the problem, there are a few.

332
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,580
I'm sure that this rings a bell, and I'm sure that you know a lot of different practices

333
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,860
which are trying to policies, practices that are trying to achieve these things to make

334
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,300
the city more environmentally friendly in terms of its transport, economic performance,

335
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:06,940
inclusive, cohesive and whatnot. I am curious what examples you know. So this is maybe an

336
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,340
easy question to answer compared to the previous one. Does anybody know any practices of sustainable

337
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,260
transport, basically? Is it my question?

338
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:24,060
Could you consider the construction of bike lanes, for example?

339
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:32,220
Yes, very much so. I mean, it's promoting a different mode of transport than the cars, right?

340
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,340
One of the soft modes cycling. So we absolutely yes.

341
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,860
What else?

342
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:45,820
I see it, Antwerp. I'm leaving

343
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,500
here next to it, about 1 kilometer of the opera in Antwerp.

344
00:20:52,460 --> 00:21:01,700
And two years ago, it was for passengers.

345
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,780
Very difficult to cross the roads.

346
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,220
And now they made a tunnel.

347
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,980
And they made a huge space for COVID transport and passengers.

348
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:19,060
So you can see now, and then a big difference,

349
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,660
a clear division from what's what's unusual until the 90s.

350
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:30,420
So you mean that there was less space of well, the current

351
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,460
for starting to be a

352
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,300
is now the human life by public transport to the world.

353
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,580
Yeah.

354
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,780
The the car was still

355
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,740
like they said it was the boss.

356
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,100
Right.

357
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,100
of the car was very important.

358
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,100
We see now we shift there.

359
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,100
And the shift basically consists of creating some infrastructure for pedestrians

360
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,100
and public transport to somehow buy.

361
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,100
Now for a meeting place for the opera.

362
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Okay, okay.

363
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Okay, very often.

364
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Just to this.

365
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Can you hear him?

366
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,220
Yeah, I just just right before the lecture I read about Paris with a more

367
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,180
restrictive policy about banning

368
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:27,180
There are parking spots in cities in in order to achieve the 50 minutes city the so-called

369
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Human city air right so restricting

370
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:39,500
Restructing current infrastructure or transforming it into different type of infrastructure for either either different modes or for pedestrians

371
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,500
So creating some urban space, okay.

372
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
What else?

373
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Maybe developing bus rapid transit.

374
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
That's not all that in America.

375
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Yeah. Does everybody, or is this somebody who doesn't know what bus rapid transit is?

376
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:01,500
It's a funny question to ask to a screen, but, oh, you know,

377
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,500
we don't tell me that it's switched again.

378
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
I have to stop sharing this screen, but perhaps you want to explain what bus rapid transit is,

379
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I'm sure that there is somebody who doesn't know.

380
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,500
I can help in case your definition is not perfect.

381
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Well, what it has.

382
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Yeah, you know, what I have as an example is this lanes that they're just for bosses.

383
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,500
So they're developed a rapid lane that it will only go for bosses.

384
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,500
It's supposed to work better around the city.

385
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:53,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's essentially creating separate lanes for buses, but what's quite specific about this or quite particular is that it kind of imitates or replaces an underground system, so a metro system, which is of course very expensive to build.

386
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:03,300
So the idea is that instead of engaging in all this digging and creating this very costly and invasive infrastructure, you can just create some separate lanes for the buses and have an efficient.

387
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,260
public transport system which is metro like.

388
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,300
And that's, I want to say common, but well, a lot of cases first emerge in the global

389
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
south, right?

390
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,380
So in South America and in South Africa, but there are also cases in global, in

391
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,820
the global north and western European.

392
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:29,140
Okay, there is a lot of these different policies and a lot of different, a lot of different

393
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,420
practices and ideas.

394
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,740
It seems.

395
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,420
So let's quickly go over, let's try to put them together

396
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,100
into some kind of coherent typology of different things

397
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,100
that cities can do in order to make this transport

398
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,260
more sustainable.

399
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,660
So the first thing is to tackle the problem, right?

400
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,100
So if the problem is the car, then how do we deal with the car?

401
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,140
Well, we can either improve the technology of the car.

402
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,420
And this means reducing emissions,

403
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,860
making it contaminate the little bit less.

404
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,180
So cleaning the engine technology,

405
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,900
substituting for of petrol,

406
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,820
these are vehicles by electric vehicles or biogas,

407
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,380
or whatnot.

408
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,260
Creating the construction of cars

409
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,980
so that they cause less casualties in case of accidents.

410
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,260
So this is something that today we take for granted

411
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,100
that cars have these crash zones

412
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,420
and crashes are being done in safety tests.

413
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,740
But this was virtually non-existent in the 1970s or '80s.

414
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,660
So that's one thing.

415
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,100
So basically it's trying to make the car

416
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,460
a better vehicle for the city.

417
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,460
Well, here, the immediate problem is that I mentioned

418
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,980
that last time among the type of vehicles

419
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,180
that see the number of sales go up.

420
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,180
Most, I mean, most rapidly in the last two or three years,

421
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,580
our SUVs, the sports utility vehicles,

422
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,540
which are basically these massive Jeep-like cars

423
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,620
which are extremely dangerous for pedestrians.

424
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,940
And if you also turn to one of the most important

425
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,500
or marketised inventors of transport technology, Elon Musk.

426
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,420
I mean, it's a guy who does electric cars, but also if you paid attention to that,

427
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,300
I don't know if you noticed that in the news.

428
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,300
I think it was early this year or last year that he produced this massive truck,

429
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:21,260
like American style pickup truck, which has not been tested in terms of its impact on

430
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,300
pedestrians in case it actually clashes with one. But there is, on the one hand, the industry

431
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,020
tries to reinvent the vehicles to make them more safe and very many friendly. On the other hand,

432
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:37,020
there is still a push for creating gigantic vehicles which simply cannot achieve that with the size

433
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:43,420
and the you know it's audience or the audience not simply looking for this. Okay so that's the car.

434
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,900
And the other thing that of course can be done is to restrict the accessibility for the car

435
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:55,900
to the city as a whole or to its different area specific zones right. So we can

436
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,460
And for example, imposed these destructive pricing instruments,

437
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,580
such as congestion charging or perage,

438
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,980
which was a more stud stolen and Dutch,

439
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,940
which was very recently announced in Brussels,

440
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,700
but it existed in several other Belgian cities

441
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,140
in one form or another for quite a while now.

442
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,900
We can think of reducing physically the space for the car,

443
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,820
so basically making roads more narrow,

444
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,100
so cutting some lanes,

445
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,580
reducing the number of parking areas.

446
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,140
And then, as it was mentioned earlier,

447
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,540
replacing this infrastructure,

448
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,540
replacing this space with other uses.

449
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,620
So opening this space, too, for example,

450
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,860
pedestrians will non-motorize traffic,

451
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,980
creating these so-called pedestrian zones,

452
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,340
or shared spaces.

453
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,980
And here have one from London in this slide.

454
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,740
And also, the famous congestion charging steam in London,

455
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,340
which means that in a specific central area of London,

456
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,660
you pay 12 pounds to enter every time you do that, right?

457
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,140
Okay, what other things can be done

458
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,380
to tackle a lot of mobility?

459
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,780
Well, of course, if we want the presence of the car to go down,

460
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,460
we need to propose some alternative to the car.

461
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,180
Our obvious alternative is public transport,

462
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,220
and here's sustainable perspectives on transport basically

463
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,620
keep emphasizing the importance of increasing the quality

464
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,460
of public transport,

465
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,980
increasing the accessibility of public transport across the urban or suburban space.

466
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:30,260
And indeed, faster rapid transit is one common example of how this can be done actually

467
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:36,580
quite inexpensively. Also, the reinstallational urban trumps in many cities in the global north

468
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:42,740
that got rid of the tram to create space for the car. If you remember my slides from last

469
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:48,660
time, that's what partly happened in Brussels in the 1970s. It's a very common way. It was a very

470
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,980
common phenomenon, common phenomenon, sorry. In France where a lot of cities,

471
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,580
tramphet work was quite simply dismantled. So here, since the 1990s, 2000s,

472
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,180
we see the return of the tramp. Urban for the finicular, so gradient,

473
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,580
skable cars, plenty of other modes, basically, of public transport. And also

474
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,460
promoting the notion of multi-modality, right? So creating different options for

475
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,780
users so that they don't have to simply choose between the car and something else,

476
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,820
but there's something else is a variety of different options from which one can choose,

477
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:27,300
depending on where they go with whom, what they feel like using in a particular moment of time,

478
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:33,300
what corresponds better to the behavior to the lifestyle, right? If the lifestyle and behavior

479
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:42,100
is what we pay attention to much more than before. And then finally, what's important in this

480
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,500
and port volume of different solutions or tools,

481
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,180
if you will, is reducing the need to travel.

482
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,420
So I mentioned already that here the idea

483
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,100
is that we make cities more dense, more mixed.

484
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,860
So perhaps we don't have to travel so often and so far.

485
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,660
And in planning for geography,

486
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,620
the idea here is to progressively

487
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,420
linked urban development with transport development.

488
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,500
So the idea of transit oriented or transport

489
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,060
the development emerged within this paradigm.

490
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,900
So for example, fostering some activities

491
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,460
and development around the development

492
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,780
of new metro stations or railway stations

493
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,780
or whole transport corridors.

494
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,580
A little bit like what I showed you last time

495
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,420
with COVID-19, right?

496
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,380
The finger, the five finger plan,

497
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,780
which was one of the first ideas

498
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,700
of linking transport development

499
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,380
at urban development.

500
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,980
And many other things that, well, quite frankly,

501
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,300
I'm much more interested in sharing with you

502
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,740
the critique of all this, then this itself.

503
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,060
Because this is very easy to find this plenty

504
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,500
of different publications on this.

505
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,780
I mean, basically, if you follow any of these websites

506
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,100
which deal with, well, these are called magazine

507
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,620
these days, follow urban policy, city lab,

508
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,020
the Atlantic, Fox, or whatnot, sure that you know

509
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,900
more than I do.

510
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,060
I mean, this is what they say.

511
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,380
I mean, this is what they promote a lot, right?

512
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,060
So the car is the problem.

513
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,060
So any time a big northern, also in the global south,

514
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,580
this is picked up a little bit.

515
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,500
But any time any city,

516
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,140
an important city does something in terms of curving

517
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,260
or vulnerability,

518
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,180
this is very often picked up at this kind of media

519
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,180
and hailed as a radical intervention,

520
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,340
as a radical step to reinvent the ability

521
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,420
to give cities back to the people,

522
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,100
to make cities more sustainable green attractive,

523
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,660
et cetera, et cetera.

524
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,500
Now, I'm not saying that this is all bad

525
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,860
and that this is problematic in itself.

526
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,900
But there is a number of critical questions

527
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,460
that ask us critical geographers

528
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,580
really need to be asking about these practices,

529
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,180
because they're quite simply, well,

530
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,660
they are not really taking full stock

531
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,820
of the complexity of cities that they're being applied

532
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,260
for one.

533
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,500
So, well, the first immediate problem

534
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,700
is that the word sustainability

535
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,900
or the term sustainability has already been picked up

536
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,900
by the industry, the paradigm, that sustainability,

537
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,980
in principle, wanted to criticize

538
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,620
and to have some critical cutting edge over.

539
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,740
So for instance, the oil industry

540
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,460
and the current industry, both claim to be extremely sustainable

541
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,100
these days, in terms of how they produce soil,

542
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,740
and in terms of how they produce vehicles.

543
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,900
I mentioned already this idea of reinventing the car,

544
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,020
which is a more sustainable mode of travel in cities.

545
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,860
But the deeper problem is that, and I will show that in a moment,

546
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:44,500
that the kind of questions that sustainable urban paradigm asks about the city

547
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,100
and the solutions that it tries to bring are essentially,

548
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:53,180
I mean, they can only reveal some transport reality to a point.

549
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,380
So it's very quick, I think, that we can read some kind of a wall.

550
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,340
And this debate between, let's say, the neoclassical engineers

551
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,940
and economists and the anti-car proponents

552
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,340
of sustainable uponities is not a very productive one.

553
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,340
And very importantly for this course said, for you,

554
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,900
as I don't know, I've been geographers

555
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,660
for a certain planet of the future,

556
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,420
the relation between transport and the urban in this debate

557
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,980
is very weak.

558
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,060
So conceptually, but also empirically,

559
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,420
this kind of thinking about transport and mobility

560
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,060
simply does not tell us a lot, I think, about the city,

561
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,220
which is why we're here tonight.

562
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,660
Right, so, though let's be constructed

563
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,420
and explore some critical stuff about it basically.

564
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,340
So, I wonder whether you can already pick up

565
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,700
some critique of this from Elena Vania

566
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,940
in her colleague, T. Riebrenak.

567
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,380
I'll be stubborn with the readings today.

568
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,340
Does anybody remember something from the reading for today?

569
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,340
I do.

570
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:12,340
It's been, since I read it, but I know that she has like identified two main principles

571
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:21,860
of critique, which is first that the alternatives that are being proposed by the automobile

572
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:29,060
industry and no specific plans, they are not very like sufficient and reducing the

573
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:40,340
out to mobile impact in certain cases. You can say something wrong and then secondly,

574
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:50,900
well it's sort of a very exclusive sometimes discussion I think, but yeah,

575
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:58,100
I it's not very present anymore, but I would like to pose another question for that paper. It kind of upset me anyway.

576
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,900
Oh yeah.

577
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,300
You can do it right now.

578
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,900
Okay.

579
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,900
Well, go ahead.

580
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:16,100
Yeah, if we're at it, like I basically I liked her way of like introducing her thoughts and like structuring the paper, but I was a bit like put off just

581
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:30,500
methodologically in the way that she links empirical evidence that she produced herself to theory

582
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:44,340
that is oftentimes very theoretical and based on very personal beliefs and attitudes which I

583
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,500
like also support in a way, but sometimes I found that did make her arguments less striking,

584
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,180
and I was just wondering because we are like still in the beginning of all of our

585
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:03,300
like urban critical research careers, how that is to be done.

586
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,700
If you have an answer to that.

587
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,380
I don't know. I mean, I don't have an answer to that question.

588
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,380
Well, I would agree with you that maybe methodologically this is not the strongest paper.

589
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,340
It's an analysis of plans and it's not very clear exactly what she's made with this.

590
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,580
Maybe it's true that her convictions are a little bit stronger than her in periods. In this

591
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:33,380
particular paper, I picked it because it's summarises a few things a little bit better than others.

592
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:40,420
But I really like what she does, even though the best work that she's done in French,

593
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,420
I think which makes it not accessible to everybody here.

594
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,420
But yeah, I think your first point in terms of what's in the article,

595
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,420
it's spot on. It's also there in the title. I mean, she maybe,

596
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,420
again, she risks being maybe a little bit

597
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,420
and engaging in some kind of exaggeration, right?

598
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,420
It's not every single sustainable urban transparency

599
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,420
that leads to the processes that she describes.

600
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:15,820
But there is a tendency for these policies to create some inequalities and for deep politicizing the debate

601
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,780
so

602
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:23,060
It's not exactly clear who these policies are supposed to be for they are these

603
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,380
Obvious a little bit again in this kind of neoclassical

604
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,060
Direction rational tools of now dealing with

605
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,740
With the car is the problem, right?

606
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:39,020
So in fact, the power relations in transport or in transport policy have not really changed.

607
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:45,660
It's just that the focus has shifted significantly and now this is what the planets are doing,

608
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,220
as opposed to what they were doing in the 1970s and '80s.

609
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,060
Let's dive into this.

610
00:37:52,060 --> 00:38:00,140
Whoops. Great. So what are the, and that's my individual, how to put it.

611
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:06,780
my personal top five of the reasons why sustainable urban transport paradigm is not exactly the

612
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,460
you know doesn't give you a complete view of the relationship between transport and the city.

613
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:20,700
And also with some I think quite practical theoretical, empirical recipes for how to get out of this

614
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:29,180
roadblock pan unintended. So the first issue with a lot of the writing on sustainability is that it's

615
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,500
it's still very much focused on technology.

616
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,860
So there is a lot of attention given to technological solutions,

617
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
where social and political innovations

618
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,780
and some brought about political activity,

619
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,940
organization, engagement of people as political agents,

620
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,660
not just the consumers and customers that have to be now

621
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,660
convinced to shift from one mode to another,

622
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,300
from the car to something else.

623
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,060
This is not so present.

624
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,300
And well, this comes from the guru himself.

625
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,940
Elon Musk, who is, despite, of course,

626
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,540
some obvious critique, was his personality

627
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,420
and how he carries himself in media,

628
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,980
he still is very much the hope for many

629
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,620
in terms of transitioning from carbon heavy

630
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,780
modes of mobility to electric vehicles,

631
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,380
which according to the industry

632
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,860
are the thing of the future.

633
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,100
So according to Elon Musk, as he says,

634
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,180
I think public transport is painful, it sucks.

635
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,900
Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other

636
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,820
that doesn't leave where you want it to leave,

637
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,860
doesn't start where you want it to start,

638
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,620
doesn't end where you want it to end.

639
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,980
It's a pain in the ass.

640
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,620
And so that's why people like individualized transport

641
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,020
that goes where you want and when you want.

642
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,100
So the idea here is not to engage in

643
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,740
collectivizing transport, for example,

644
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,780
and making this a more common service

645
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,860
or a more common experience to break

646
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,980
not only the paradigm of dependency on fossil fuels

647
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:00,060
the car, but the tendency on the visual transport, making this basically a less individual

648
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:04,900
activity, which is a social political activity as well.

649
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,660
Now to the contrary, here the idea is to develop a better technology within the power

650
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,980
and a more than a visual transport.

651
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:15,100
And you don't mask, I mean, he's doing a lot of things, but one of the other things

652
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:21,700
in Tesla and the production of electric vehicles that he does is boring tunnels on the Los

653
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:27,780
Angeles to basically create some parallel motorway system if we can call it this way, that bypasses

654
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:35,220
congestion. So actually the focus here while might apparently be on making transport sustainable,

655
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:40,260
it is essentially to solve congestion, which is an extremely, as I explained last time, new

656
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:49,060
classical formulation of the problem. Another issue, and that's from an envious paper, but I think

657
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:54,980
It's not from the one that you had to read for today, but from another thing that I that I like from here is this

658
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,940
focus on

659
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,940
the individual as

660
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,260
not only well

661
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:09,420
I'm to put it not only is the source of a number of transport problems, but also as a solution to to address these problems, right?

662
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,900
So

663
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,900
the idea here is that

664
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,220
Essentially, we can convince people to change the habits,

665
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,620
to change the lifestyle related to transport and mobility.

666
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,500
And in this way, we can solve a number of issues related

667
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,900
to this field of urban planning or urban policies,

668
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:36,260
which means that within the sustainable paradigm,

669
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,700
a lot of policymakers, a lot of trans-foods, they hold us,

670
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,780
would rather than engage in the politics of transport,

671
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,220
they would engage on the pedagogy gets related to it.

672
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:50,420
So it's suddenly the challenge is to make sure

673
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,100
that people engage less in behavior

674
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,540
that is identified as bad behavior, for example,

675
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,820
driving or living in the suburbs, flying around,

676
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,020
and switching to what is considered to be good

677
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,980
type of behavior, positive behavior.

678
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,020
So, cycling around, walking,

679
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,140
living in a city center, living in these dense,

680
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,380
mixed urban areas that don't require

681
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,300
that you engage in mobility so much.

682
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,740
And while this, of course, is not a problem in itself,

683
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,420
I mean, it's good to think of why would people

684
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,820
stick to particular ways of moving?

685
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,740
What's very detrimental, I think, to the debate

686
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,900
and to ultimately solving some issues related to transport

687
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,580
is putting these different ways of moving

688
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,780
and different behaviors related to movement in a hierarchy

689
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,940
where clearly there is a moral component.

690
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,900
So this good and bad behavior, I think this is something

691
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,380
that can actually antagonize people against one another

692
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,660
rather than try to think of transfer problems

693
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,500
as common societal problems.

694
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,860
That's issue number one.

695
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,420
And issue number two is that in this discussion

696
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,220
about individual behavior, engagement with analyzing

697
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,380
and anonymity addressing structural causes

698
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,780
behind transport and mobility is not so present.

699
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,500
So if we focus on the question, why would people drive?

700
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:17,020
and why would people, for example, even in specific ethnicity or gender or class,

701
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,580
trying more than others, it is very important to also understand what is the structure

702
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:29,020
behind this, what is the general policy that allows people to obtain access to a vehicle

703
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:34,140
that allows a parallel or occurring structure which very often, and that's the case definitely in

704
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:41,420
Belgium, it's often absolutely free to use with no taxes to use motorways,

705
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:48,300
or with cheap parking, etcetera, etcetera. So this perspective is in itself not a problem

706
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,380
to look at you know why people engage in particular, the type of behavior and other,

707
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,820
but it's very important to also understand structures behind this.

708
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:04,060
What Alejandro and Nia also writes a lot about and many others as well, but as I said I'm really

709
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:13,020
quite convinced by writing is the uneven geography that is being produced by these different

710
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:22,940
sustainable solutions. Some of these asking a question in the chat, so let me read that.

711
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,020
So maybe there's something in between. For example, self-driving cars and apps like Uber

712
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:32,860
would be able to create smaller vehicles that can be shared as public transport. So in a sense,

713
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:40,540
in between but in between of in between what and between private I mean in

714
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,820
really individual transport and and collective transport you mean

715
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:50,220
Rudy do you want to explain whoever you are?

716
00:44:50,220 --> 00:45:00,780
Hello Rudy are you with us? I hope you didn't just write the comment left

717
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,220
Maybe the connection is not very good on your end.

718
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:11,100
Well, yeah, I mean, clearly in recent years, there's

719
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,020
been a rise of expectations towards this, shared mobility

720
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:15,660
laws, right?

721
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,740
So a number of practices which allow you to get access to

722
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,980
seemingly collectivize transport like Uber.

723
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,180
I mean, essentially you don't own the vehicle, but it's just

724
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,060
not even a phone call with a tap on your phone away.

725
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,780
But there is a number of issues with this.

726
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,300
So there's a question whether this actually replaces individual transport.

727
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,220
So do people have less cars because Uber is expanding in this city

728
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,260
if we're focusing on Uber industries?

729
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,020
There is also a lot of studies that show that Uber actually adds to congestion.

730
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:56,220
So there are more Uber develops in the city or it's counterparts

731
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,620
are different, are the competitive platforms left in China.

732
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,260
There was a huge company called DDE that essentially does what

733
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,660
it was with us.

734
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,460
So there are more of these companies developed in your city.

735
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:14,140
There are more, what the total number of vehicles, the car stock,

736
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,700
increases, which means, and that's a problem in a lot of Chinese cities,

737
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,140
you basically have more traffic jams.

738
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,660
So these cars are in traffic all the time.

739
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,860
They keep looking for customers.

740
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:30,700
they have a mobile, which means that you add to the problem that you try to solve, which

741
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,860
when you try to solve again adding more to these shared platforms.

742
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:40,140
And also the big issue with Uber, if we are focusing on this for a moment, is that the

743
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,580
working conditions of course are quite terrible.

744
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:48,420
So the idea there is that essentially there are exceptions to this, but in most cities where

745
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,420
Uber operates.

746
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:55,740
We workers are not really workers, they're contractors, which means that they very often

747
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,140
go in debt to actually get the vehicle that they're driving, that they have to pay back

748
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,020
to Uber, because it's offering also these services.

749
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,820
This means that they work for a long hours.

750
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:11,100
Unlike regular taxi drivers that have to actually clock in and out, this is much more

751
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,860
regulated in terms of how they work for a lot amount of time and also what knowledge

752
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,140
of the city they have. I don't know how often you've taken Uber in your life, but it's

753
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:25,980
often the case that these drivers are exploring the city along. I mean, they just learn

754
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:31,260
as they drive, which I understand they might come from a very difficult situation that

755
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:37,260
this is the only way for them to get access to a more or less decent way of making money.

756
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:43,540
But there's a question of safety, there's a question of ethics in terms of inviting such

757
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:49,300
your practice in our cities. So there are a lot of expectations for these platforms and indeed

758
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,020
there is a question, does this maybe set between public transport, collective transport and

759
00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:00,020
individual transport but I would say that these hopes are still not really fulfilled.

760
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:05,860
Okay, that was a bit of a delay question. Let's go back to an even geography of sustainable transport.

761
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:14,500
So what is the problem here? More often than not, the application of the sustainable tools,

762
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,860
different policies, infrastructural measures to deal with mobility,

763
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:27,940
especially quite exclusive. What does it mean? Well, on the one hand, it often happens that

764
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,380
a lot of these measures are applied in a specific area of the city and more often than not,

765
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:40,180
This is the central urban core, which has to be saved from the car, which the car has to limit its presence,

766
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:46,900
which in no way contradicts or prevents further maintenance at least, if not development or further

767
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:52,500
infrastructure for the cars in more peripheral areas. So you can think of cities in which in the city

768
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,260
centre you've got restrictive parking regulations, you've got a lot of pedestrian areas.

769
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,820
It's simply not easy to drive around.

770
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:05,620
I think transport is definitely a more logical thing to do and to use to get into.

771
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,620
But the farther you go to the suburbs, the more

772
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:14,740
month I lay in streets or highways you see, or actual proper highways, a lot of parking lots,

773
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:19,220
all the infrastructure that actually well belongs to the 1970s and 1980s.

774
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:25,860
And that is, I think, situation not only in Belgium or in Brussels specifically,

775
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:42,860
But in a lot of these cities that are supposedly have achieved a great level of policy in terms of dealing with with with cuts of Copenhagen, Vienna, a lot of French cities that boast these tram renewal programs.

776
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:48,820
As long as you are in the central part of the city, this old looks very coherent and very

777
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:53,140
well inverted, common, good from the sustainable transport perspective.

778
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,620
But the farther you go from the city centre, the more actually the more cars you see, the

779
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:02,220
more it actually resembles the problem that these policies try to solve.

780
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:09,860
Another inequality is of the vertical kind, meaning that it often happens that the investment

781
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:15,780
in these kind of sustainable tools comes at the cost of putting the current infrastructure underground.

782
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:22,340
So you can think of any case in which the specialization of an urban avenue or pull-over,

783
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,900
that means that the cars have to be put underground parking lots or the highways.

784
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:34,500
And this is often the problem in the so-called Car-Free Cities. The cities that are often picked up

785
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,540
by international media and praised for having addressed head-on the domination of the

786
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:49,620
cars and dealt with the problem of opportunity. A specific tool that I think we can see this

787
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:56,020
uneven geography in is a question in the chat. An example for Rudy's question from Berlin,

788
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,740
great. Let me go on with the congestion charging while you're discussing Uber in the chat.

789
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:07,220
this is perfectly allowed. So an example of this uneven geography can be found in

790
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:15,540
congestion charging, which is one of the let's say one of the most classical tools of sustainable

791
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:21,700
transport paradigm in terms of limiting the presence of the cars. The idea is simple. It came from

792
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:26,900
Singapore in the 1970s, which was developed as a very new classical tool of planning,

793
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,020
basically the problem was congestion and the idea was to convince to encourage drivers to use the

794
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:40,820
car off peak, so to minimize the traffic, the traffic jams in morning and afternoon or evening peak hours.

795
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:47,620
And progressively this tool, or perhaps with a shift of velocity behind transmit from the

796
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:55,380
neoclassical sustainable perspectives, this tool was picked up by the sustainable narrative. And now

797
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,540
It not only allows to solve congestion, but actually it allows to limit the presence of the

798
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:04,500
current city, which of course supposedly makes a positive impact on the urban environment.

799
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,900
And this tool has been put in place in the number of cities in Europe.

800
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:14,580
So you hear sea pictures from Oslo, but actually this exists in pretty much all

801
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:22,580
Norwegian cities and towns. So a system of tolling gates in London, which is probably the most

802
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:28,820
important or the most known case in Europe, in Milan, but you also have similar policies and

803
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:34,580
instruments in Stockholm and Sweden. And then recently also in Brussels announced with a lot of

804
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:41,540
pump and circumstance this idea that now it will cost the user the end-user money to enter with

805
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:50,900
a car to the Brussels capital region. So while this gets a lot of attention and this policy is

806
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:57,140
is discussed as a very efficient tool

807
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,340
in terms of limiting the presence of the current in cities.

808
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,860
There is questionable evidence.

809
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,380
I'm not saying that this policy is a bad policy,

810
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,340
but it never works.

811
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:13,220
But basically, it's supposed productive results

812
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,580
in terms of limiting the car are not exactly

813
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,180
there in the evidence.

814
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,940
So the results are quite mixed.

815
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,780
On the one hand, we see that in a number of cities,

816
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,220
traffic, of course, diminishes.

817
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,220
But since it's the delimited zone,

818
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,260
it's quite particular.

819
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:33,420
So it's not a whole agglomeration that actually

820
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,780
has the access to the car limited.

821
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:39,380
We see that the traffic often moves from, of course,

822
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,940
the zone in which the congestion challenge

823
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,300
is applied to the outer areas.

824
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,380
In London, for instance, it's quite clear

825
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,220
that there is significantly more traffic around that zone.

826
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,540
It's the same case in Madrid, which essentially

827
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,020
followed a very similar principle.

828
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,700
There is also very questionable evidence

829
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,980
about what happens with the funds that are being raised

830
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,100
through these systems.

831
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,700
So while very often, these policies

832
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,180
are put in place with this narrative of saving the city

833
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,060
from the car, of making some kind of societal transition

834
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:14,180
to post-car society, in cities like Oslo or London,

835
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,540
funds from these schemes.

836
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,780
And in all that's very clear, in London,

837
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,540
maybe a little bit less transparent.

838
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,140
But at least part of these funds goes to actually maintenance

839
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,940
and construction of current construction.

840
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,340
In all it's very common practice

841
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,620
to put these congestion charging areas

842
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,900
or booths, if you will,

843
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,260
to actually subsidize the construction of specific

844
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,420
transport infrastructure, road tunnel or bridge.

845
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,660
It's done in a very transparent way.

846
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,580
So in a sense, it's basically asking the transport

847
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,860
the car user to contribute a little bit more,

848
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,900
because of course, this contribution is already there

849
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,940
through tax system, to the construction,

850
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,460
to the financing of the construction

851
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,820
of transport infrastructure of current infrastructure.

852
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,460
And finally, the impact of these schemes

853
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,540
on overall quality of the city,

854
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,100
not just on a quality in a specific area,

855
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,060
is quite limited.

856
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:13,220
So, yeah, I said it basically.

857
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,320
So despite the narrative of these practices

858
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,140
saving urban environment,

859
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:21,020
it's not exactly clear that this is the most obvious thing

860
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,900
to do to limit the smog in a city,

861
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,100
especially when these areas are quite,

862
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,340
especially limited.

863
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,260
The problems that immediately emerge

864
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,020
from policies like congestion charging is that,

865
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,020
well, it leads to some social segregation.

866
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:44,060
And so we expect that all people react to this policy in a similar way.

867
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,540
They will reconsider whether they want to try or not, whether they want to enter,

868
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,380
into the zone by current or not.

869
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:53,340
But in fact, of course, those who do not pay from the vehicle,

870
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:57,380
and in particular in Belgium, this is a policy that is very widespread.

871
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,260
Half of new vehicles sold in Belgium are so-called company cars,

872
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,380
which are received for free by employees from the company

873
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,620
as a way of giving them tax-free salary bonus basically.

874
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,700
So for these people who do not pay for the vehicle itself

875
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,620
and often whose consumption of the vehicle will gas,

876
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,020
or any kind of fuel they put in the car insurance,

877
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,100
this is all paid by the company very often.

878
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,060
This very often basically is included in the package.

879
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,860
So the congestion charging is actually not covered

880
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,660
by the individual, it's covered by the structure

881
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,340
that provides the vehicle in the first place.

882
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:36,460
While of course those who do not have a job who might be seeking one,

883
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:44,140
those who are from lower working class background who might also be doing very difficult,

884
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:49,900
complicated irregular trips that require entering and leaving in different times of day,

885
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,940
because they need to get to a job that quite simply requires getting by current.

886
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,100
Going back here to this example of somebody working logistics,

887
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,340
public transport between Mollenberg or Savantam, for example,

888
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,860
at three o'clock in the morning being simply not there,

889
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,540
you have to have a card to reach this kind of activity

890
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:13,220
to be able to access the kind of urban function.

891
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,340
And then ultimately, what it does to mobility

892
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,660
is commodified.

893
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:22,420
So it's an essentially neoliberal service.

894
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,180
You pay as much as you use.

895
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,100
It's not a common system anymore.

896
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,720
The idea is that everybody pays not according to the means

897
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,720
but according to the ultimately the price decided by the market.

898
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:41,000
So again, not to say that this is a part of good idea

899
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,260
but to say that there is quite simply a lot of questions

900
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,760
a lot of them quite clearly related to critical geography

901
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,920
that should be asked about these policies.

902
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,840
It's already passed seven.

903
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,000
So it's just we take at least 500 break

904
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,120
before we can continue.

905
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,920
So get a little bit of a drink.

906
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,240
whatever it is that you are you sipping to make through this lecture.

907
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,080
And I'll see you back in in for five minutes, all right.

908
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:26,880
Perfect.

[ Silence ]

963
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:42,340
Okay, let's try to resume.

964
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:49,340
I'm going to share my screen once again.

965
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:59,340
All right.

966
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,340
Where are we?

967
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:04,700
All right

968
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:11,980
I suppose you hear me and you see me

969
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:15,780
Great perfect so

970
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:22,140
Continuing with the uneven geography of sustainable transport measures

971
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:27,180
Here you have a very simple

972
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:35,980
or even a map or a scheme that shows a little bit how this limitation plays out in space.

973
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,380
So also, I don't know if you've heard about that, but also is one of the most

974
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:44,700
-marketised cities in terms of its alleged fight against the car.

975
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:50,660
It's leading some kind of a war against the petrol fuel vehicles.

976
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:55,980
And basically there is this area in the city in which to which access is not only restricted

977
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,740
in terms of extra payment, right?

978
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,860
So there was a cube.

979
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,140
At several layers of this congestion charging,

980
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:07,220
and then the final one is this ultra inner city

981
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:12,220
in which cars propelled by gas or fuel.

982
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,460
I'm not allowed, there's only electric vehicles.

983
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,420
But then when you look at the whole

984
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,740
of the migration of the city is quite clear that,

985
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:20,420
I mean, this is a very small area.

986
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,820
So we are actually talking about quite specific zones

987
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,460
of the city, which as I mentioned,

988
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:32,820
supposedly saved from the car and as opposed to be made more pedestrian or people friendly.

989
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:44,260
Same idea or same limitation can be seen in Madrid which, until recently, had also quite a restrictive mobility area.

990
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:50,020
This has changed with a change of political majority, it does not matter, but this area still exists over the rules.

991
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,380
have changed to some extent.

992
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:58,740
The idea is that Madrid, which was called in worldwide media,

993
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,100
as an anti-car municipality, a municipality that takes

994
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,820
some radical measures to limit the presence of the car.

995
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:08,140
In fact, well, it does serve, but it does so

996
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:13,380
within quite limited designated area,

997
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,660
whereas you see that in a general map.

998
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,060
There is a whole current structure around it,

999
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:23,660
multiple motorways both around and from that central area.

1000
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,900
So there's a question with the automability

1001
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:31,460
is actually being properly challenged

1002
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:34,060
or is this more of an urban policy that focuses

1003
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:37,260
on valorization of specific areas of the city.

1004
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:41,980
And here it's you don't have to be a smart critical geography

1005
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:45,980
to ask if this is not part of some revitalization strategies

1006
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:49,900
that try to increase rent and profits

1007
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,820
to gentify quite simply a specific areas of the city,

1008
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:57,620
the limitation of car traffic being part of that policy,

1009
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:01,660
to beautify the area, to make it more attractive to tourists,

1010
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:06,660
to specific type of investors, while limiting mobility

1011
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,460
of this kind.

1012
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,940
This we've covered.

1013
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:17,460
And here we arrive to the well, to a case of such a policy,

1014
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,060
limiting presence of the car, the Pietonier in Brussels,

1015
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,900
which I'm quite sure.

1016
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:28,420
All of you have already experienced and seen.

1017
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,780
So, well, this map you've seen quite a lot before

1018
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:36,300
and show Brussels with its zone 30,

1019
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,460
so the limitation of speed there.

1020
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:46,580
the Petonier marked in red at the moment of installation, the biggest pedestrian area in Europe.

1021
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:54,100
I wonder whether you've got any impressions of this place before I show you my take on

1022
01:07:54,100 --> 01:08:00,260
or share with you my take on what happened over there. I imagine you have been to Lippetonia,

1023
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:06,500
but do you have any any interesting thoughts about this? Do you like this place? Do you think

1024
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:17,460
It's not so great. I don't know. I don't have a very deep thought about it. I don't think

1025
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:25,860
but it's definitely nicer than it was. I mean, I lived in the center for like five years ago

1026
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:31,460
or like five years ago, like long ago, but like it was really horrible. Like when you cycle

1027
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:38,740
through like downtown it was really awful because like the road was just disgusting like

1028
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:45,860
you don't you didn't really want to be there. I mean it's a bit I don't know I don't have

1029
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:54,580
the feeling it's very much it's it's very true for what it is you know like for like I don't

1030
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:59,940
know it doesn't really feel like a downtown it feels a little bit provincial but like at least

1031
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:04,940
I'm definitely happy with that it's much better than it used to be.

1032
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:11,940
It's definitely an improvement, but it feels the big city vibe a bit.

1033
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:12,940
Okay.

1034
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:17,940
But those of you who didn't see it before it was changing to a village scenario,

1035
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:24,940
I think it's the slice you see in the top image how this street could look like on a Friday afternoon,

1036
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:25,940
quite regularly.

1037
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:28,940
So full of cars for full lanes.

1038
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:33,940
And then, well, the situation, that's of course pre-covid.

1039
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:34,940
Well, I don't know.

1040
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:37,260
I probably right now, if you took that picture,

1041
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,540
would be quite similar.

1042
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,340
Anybody else who has some impressions

1043
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,900
of how this transformation looked like?

1044
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:49,900
Somebody who loves this, somebody who hates this,

1045
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:51,300
and for whatever reason?

1046
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:55,940
- I agree with you, everyone,

1047
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:58,700
because it was a place.

1048
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,260
And when I passed, when I studied in Brussels,

1049
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,540
I would have passed with my girlfriends.

1050
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,260
I don't want my girlfriend to let alone,

1051
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:09,900
or they had to place some years ago.

1052
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,620
But one frustration, I guess from,

1053
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:16,820
I followed the top process.

1054
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:21,820
And what I know was it was very difficult for transportation,

1055
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:26,740
like like M.E.B. and the steep public transport,

1056
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:30,260
to pass because the lane was cut.

1057
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,940
- Yeah.

1058
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:36,380
- So they waited for four, four, two hours to go to another place

1059
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,700
when it set to us, five minutes was two hours.

1060
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:43,180
- So you need to affect it the other modes of,

1061
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,460
of trying to not only the car,

1062
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,060
but also public transport.

1063
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,060
- Yeah.

1064
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:47,900
- Yeah.

1065
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:50,740
The victim was public transport and I guess in,

1066
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,300
in Brussels, it's very important to,

1067
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,740
when you have a prestige project like that,

1068
01:10:55,740 --> 01:11:00,740
You need to consider all of transport modes and not only pedestrians.

1069
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,100
- Praise each project.

1070
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,740
- I think also it's an important thing.

1071
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:10,060
Also like an element to add maybe is that it's terrible

1072
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,260
if you go by bike.

1073
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,060
It's really not made for bicycles.

1074
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,340
Like I tried cycling through it and I mean, right now

1075
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,820
it's not so busy and it's all right.

1076
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:22,820
But like on days when there's lots of tourists,

1077
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,420
of course lots of people use the area.

1078
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:28,380
So then it's really not nice to cycle there.

1079
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,780
- Yes, I share these impressions.

1080
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,460
I mean, these are not only impressions

1081
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,300
and the fact is that this area was redeveloped

1082
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,900
but without any bicycle policy in mind.

1083
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,220
So there is basically, I'm not,

1084
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,060
I'm the last person to say that what was there before

1085
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:45,660
was great, but you can vaguely see it

1086
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,260
on the right hand side of the top picture

1087
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,900
that there is actually a bicycle lane.

1088
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,260
Not a great one, but there was one.

1089
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:54,340
Now it's simply not there.

1090
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:57,100
somebody's writing something in the chat.

1091
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,940
Why did they take down the larger trees

1092
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,620
to be a traditionalization of Boulevardless?

1093
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:03,020
But I find the landscaping quite poor.

1094
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:06,740
Well, so there was a number of things at stake.

1095
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:09,820
I mean, let's cover that first.

1096
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,180
It was announced in January 2014,

1097
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,180
the municipal authorities of the city of Brussels.

1098
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:17,460
So we said, "Meel, Brussels 1000,

1099
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,140
"and ours that they want to expand

1100
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,460
"and existing pedestrians."

1101
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,140
So you already had some streets,

1102
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,260
especially towards the Commonwealth of London,

1103
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:26,340
were not open for the class.

1104
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,580
And the context of that-- and that's quite an important thing--

1105
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:31,260
is that there was a series of protests

1106
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,900
called Under the Slogon of Picnic the Streets,

1107
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,780
a movement of some spontaneous civil disobedience.

1108
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:40,620
Basically, people would occupy space that would normally

1109
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,540
be taken by cars.

1110
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:45,500
You see that in the top picture, normally a lot of cars.

1111
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,900
So right in front of books, there

1112
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,100
would be basically some kind of an action.

1113
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:56,300
people would just sit down and enjoy their son and manifest that they want allegedly

1114
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:01,820
this space to be for people, taken away from the cars. This space should be freed from

1115
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:05,900
the cars to make the city centre of Brussels for sustainable, more attractive and more

1116
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:10,240
livable. The project is launched in June 2015, so that's one of the

1117
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:15,340
three is closed. And there is an eight-man test phase without any infrastructural change.

1118
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:19,980
So at first, to go a little bit to the question of design, there is no design change. Basically,

1119
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:25,020
the street is closed and there is as many people call it a sea of asphalt.

1120
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,260
I mean suddenly you can walk on this on the street, which place a little bit,

1121
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:33,260
of course, on people's imaginary that suddenly you realize how, how huge this

1122
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:38,780
infrastructure given to the car is and what could happen in place of this infrastructure.

1123
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:44,780
Well, and then progressively after this eight-month phase, we see some kind of

1124
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:50,060
infrastructure development, so an actual change of the built environment.

1125
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:54,980
The problem there is, is that, well, there was a quality of design that has been put in

1126
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:55,980
the question.

1127
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:59,540
I'm not a designer or landscape, but a lot of people have criticized the way that this

1128
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,540
looks like.

1129
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:06,120
The immediate limitation is that, right underground, we've got a canal towards the end

1130
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,860
of the bits of the year, and we also have a metro line, of pre-metroline, which runs

1131
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,180
right under the surface of the street.

1132
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:15,100
So it's not, for example, possible apparently

1133
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,200
to put large trees over there, which already

1134
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:23,020
starts making an impact in terms of how the space is done.

1135
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:28,660
Well, there were very high aspirations

1136
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,260
when Pitunio was announced.

1137
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,620
It was not only supposed to be a transport project,

1138
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:36,380
or according to some scholars in Brussels,

1139
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:39,100
or even politicians, it was not a transport project,

1140
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,060
or a mobility project.

1141
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:47,980
was an urban renewal project which by closing this Paris like Boulevard because actually

1142
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:56,060
it is in its architecture very much an inspiration of Parisian boulevards. A closing of it to

1143
01:14:56,060 --> 01:15:01,980
motorized traffic was supposedly a step towards getting the city center or the city as such

1144
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:09,340
out of the climb to put as the mayor of a moistel mill of the particular moistel

1145
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:14,700
said that Brussels, the Belgian and European capital would finally enjoy a truly dynamic,

1146
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:20,060
pedestrian, attractive and friendly inner city, like many other international metropolists.

1147
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:25,660
The Plas de Guacare, which is located in the northern part of the Piedtagnier,

1148
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:30,620
and that's the famous square famous I'm not sure, but the characteristic one with the Coca-Cola

1149
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:38,620
and signed that lights up. It was compared to Times Square, so the idea was to make this project

1150
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:43,260
It allowed Brussels to become an international city

1151
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,220
to create this prestige project,

1152
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,420
as it was, I think, very rightly said,

1153
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,220
that would put Brussels on the international map.

1154
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:53,820
It was not just a question of getting rid of some

1155
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,860
correlated new senses.

1156
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:58,020
And of course, the moment that plan was unearthed,

1157
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,020
there were a number of critics.

1158
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,180
So there were shopkeepers that were upset,

1159
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,620
claiming that they would use customers

1160
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:05,100
because people could not drive into the shop,

1161
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,060
residents, a number of citizen organizations.

1162
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:11,300
What were the issues that they would mention,

1163
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,900
and even the problems that they would note about the project?

1164
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,420
Well, they very much relate to this

1165
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,060
and the geography that I was talking about.

1166
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:22,460
So if you look at the map of the Pizzo here,

1167
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:27,260
in red UCDs, at that time Europe's largest

1168
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,700
pedestrian zone, I think now it's been surpassed by Ghent

1169
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,140
and other cities.

1170
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,780
Brussels is certainly not the only city in Europe

1171
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:37,540
or in the world that engages in these policies.

1172
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:48,140
It is, of course, the main central axis is cut, but you see that you can actually drive around the city center.

1173
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:56,340
So you've got this area which is pedestrian friendly if we can put it this way, where cars mobility is extremely limited.

1174
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:01,340
But in fact, you can quite easily drive into the Pentagon, as we call it, and drive around.

1175
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:06,340
On top of that was also very clear is that a particularity of Brussels,

1176
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:10,340
which is a very high presence of underground or multi-story parking lots,

1177
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,340
is largely unquestioned.

1178
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:19,340
So actually this day, today, there is about 19,000 parking spots within the

1179
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,340
pendant, within the Struk City Centre of Brussels.

1180
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:26,340
The original plan of pedestrianising will advance.

1181
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:32,420
a lot included the creation of additional 1,600 parking spots.

1182
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:38,900
So the idea would be that, of course, we give this space to the pedestrian and we allow this

1183
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,100
space to be somehow reclaimed from the car.

1184
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:46,580
But in fact, the cost of this, or the price of this, I don't know how to call it, is that

1185
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:48,300
we actually add to the current infrastructure.

1186
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:55,260
So we definitely do not want to make this be less accessible as it was called by the cars.

1187
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:00,220
And then as one of you mentioned, there was an immediate conflict with a public transport

1188
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:05,420
operator, the most important one in Brussels, Stephen McAvill, who basically saw their

1189
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,460
lines pushed out of the zone.

1190
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:14,660
So suddenly the buses that would cross that area have to have to have these stops relocated,

1191
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:23,380
which means the accessibility for people who rely on public transport is somewhat reduced

1192
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:24,380
right.

1193
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:31,100
Well, that's some years later. I think that picture is from 2018, as I remember checking on Google.

1194
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:35,180
Well, those are kind of a pushback, right? So the cars that were at first,

1195
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:40,380
definitely not allowed in Petonier now in some circumstances, in some situations, can actually

1196
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:45,660
enter. So you can actually see, and that's taken directly from Google, I didn't have to go to the

1197
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:51,740
Petonier and wait for a track to enter. You actually see, of course, the delivery vehicles,

1198
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:56,380
but also public transport you see over there in the back of the picture as she does a bus

1199
01:18:56,380 --> 01:19:01,100
making a turn and entering a petrion. And whenever I'm there with friends who are not from

1200
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:06,460
Brussels, I mean they are really surprised to be on the pedestrian area with public transport

1201
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:11,820
buses and trucks and taxi drivers and other vehicles who in exceptional circumstances actually can

1202
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:17,820
enter. Which question is a little bit this, I mean is this a pedestrian area or is this a pedestrian

1203
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:21,820
area but without really getting rid of all the costs.

1204
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:30,820
The question of making this a prestige project and putting Brussels on the map,

1205
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:35,820
I mean there is an argument there to be made and some local critical

1206
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:39,820
geographers have made it myself included that this in fact indeed is not a

1207
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:42,820
transport project in the mobility project. It's clearly a project of

1208
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:49,180
of re-valorizing this particular part of the city, it's quite clear that as you go down

1209
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:54,820
southwards down Boulevard of Stau and Boulevard of Le Monier towards the South Station

1210
01:19:54,820 --> 01:20:00,220
Government of Medi, those of you who have been there, I'm sure, I'm sure noticed it,

1211
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:05,220
those of you who haven't, that's where we will go on the excursion that I hope we will

1212
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,220
do.

1213
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:10,740
In spring, you see that this is one of the poorest neighborhoods in Brussels, one with

1214
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:17,820
very high youth unemployment, especially when there was a very precarious, tightly knit,

1215
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,900
but very vulnerable local economy.

1216
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:27,780
And any kind of change in built environments puts this economy under huge pressure, especially

1217
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:35,380
when the narrative around Kaitanya clearly includes this idea of bringing big grants, tourism,

1218
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:42,100
to the pedestrian area making this a place of facilities, of consumption, of continuous festival.

1219
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:49,460
So for example, the ultimate for comments of the city of Brussels famously said that

1220
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:54,740
the objective here is not to change mobility. The objective is to create a commercial

1221
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:59,940
promenade, new brands which are not yet present in Brussels are coming. There is a real craze

1222
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:07,620
and you can feel it. For the current Brussels 1000 May not the one that had to step down because

1223
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:14,020
of some corruption scandal, the aim of the project is to keep or bring the middle-class

1224
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:20,820
to Brussels to increase its tax base. So suddenly the idea is not just to or not at all to actually

1225
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:26,580
get rid of the cars or allow pedestrians to enjoy in some kind of newly created area,

1226
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:29,860
It's a very urban project in a very twisted way.

1227
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:35,460
So the idea really is to create a new space and your neighborhood perhaps of consumption,

1228
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:44,980
of leisure, of 24/7 shopping, which also, of course, uses or engages with the narrative

1229
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:51,060
of sustainability and livability, and is somewhat related to mobility and transport, but to a limited

1230
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:52,980
extent. Okay.

1231
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:56,980
Can I still add something to that?

1232
01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:03,580
If you go back to that slide, you see that there is almost only white people there.

1233
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:10,180
So the people that you talked about that you see on the lower slide, like the owners

1234
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:17,820
of the PC market, owners of the 5.50, basically all people with a color, they don't

1235
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:21,300
feature in the marketing of the city about the project.

1236
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:26,060
It's a very good point, of course. That's a very common issue with these visualizations

1237
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:28,260
and imagining of future.

1238
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:33,780
Everyone's super white. But there's one black man on the right.

1239
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:40,100
But there's also no people with disabilities, very few old people.

1240
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:48,260
Yes, it's not a very diverse image. It's a good point. And also in no way does it correspond

1241
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:51,380
the actual reality of that neighborhood and the kind of services.

1242
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,140
Absolutely not.

1243
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:56,100
Well, I mean, yeah.

1244
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,340
Well, I'm really just teed it up.

1245
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:02,740
So we cover some important stuff until we finish.

1246
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:03,460
No, no, but thank you.

1247
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:04,900
It's a good comment.

1248
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,780
There is, of course, all issues related to participation

1249
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:13,320
and no actual change of power in the P

1250
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,740
is a very good example of how these sustainable ideas

1251
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:22,580
can be applied without changing at all questions of who actually decides and for whom transport

1252
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:28,660
policies are being made. So very often the sustainable discourse focuses when a

1253
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:35,460
demandance participation of users of the of the of the of the projects. It basically

1254
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:41,140
imagines that the main idea is that it will consensus to inform people of the decisions that

1255
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:46,180
are rational, that are good practices, best practices in terms of achieving sustainable

1256
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:49,420
mobility, protecting the environment and whatnot.

1257
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:54,420
So as a Flamish actually scholar once wrote it in 2000

1258
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:57,220
about the problems of sustainable transport policies.

1259
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:59,100
That's the last bullet point.

1260
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,060
These policies include a harmonious and conflict

1261
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:04,780
of only vocabulary that ignores and silences

1262
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:07,460
the deeply contested ways through which the transport system

1263
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,740
is continuously shaped and transformed,

1264
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,980
and which inevitably results in a variety of winning

1265
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,140
and losing interest groups.

1266
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,420
in the case of the Kit-Wun-Ye, but that's, I think,

1267
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:19,180
the case in many other sustainable transport projects.

1268
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:22,380
This idea of winners and losers is swept under the carpet.

1269
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:25,260
So in theory, everybody gains,

1270
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,540
but those who are clearly upset are not heard,

1271
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:30,940
are not really listened to and often are mocked.

1272
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,740
So again, we go back to this moral geography

1273
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,340
of bad behavior and good behavior,

1274
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,780
of silly shopkeepers who don't understand

1275
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,900
that this is a project that they will benefit from,

1276
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,420
bad car drivers, they want to access the city,

1277
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,940
versus good consuming middle class pedestrians

1278
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:49,980
or cyclists, not so much on the case of duplicating method.

1279
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:52,140
Cyclists are also part of the vision.

1280
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:58,580
And in all this, to make this point quite short,

1281
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,900
there is much more impact,

1282
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,100
no, not impact, much more focus,

1283
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:07,820
much more emphasis on the success of these practices,

1284
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:12,500
rather than on the interaction with complex social,

1285
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,820
spatial phenomena that are there in the city.

1286
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:18,180
So there was much more focus on the transport part

1287
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,580
of transport project rather than on the urban part

1288
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,540
of the purchase.

1289
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,580
Well, we don't have a lot of time to deal with,

1290
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:26,700
okay, what could be done with this hegemony

1291
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:30,180
of neo-Neoclassical on the one hand, that's last week,

1292
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:32,300
and sustainable on the other.

1293
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,220
That's today, perspective on transport, but let's try.

1294
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,580
So what would diverse critical approaches

1295
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:42,260
to transport and mobility be?

1296
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:45,340
On the one hand, the new mobility paradigm.

1297
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,900
So that's another reading for today,

1298
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,660
if you manage to read it, that's great.

1299
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:52,220
If not, I encourage you to have a look

1300
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,340
because that's an absolutely fundamental reading

1301
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,220
for mobility scholars these days.

1302
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,260
I mean, many shallering John Aria

1303
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:03,100
to very important figures in this field of geography

1304
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:07,260
or any kind of discipline that deals with mobility and transport.

1305
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:10,500
So here, we've got a bit of a shift of attention,

1306
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:14,820
shift of focus, and it's really putting,

1307
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:18,380
it's shifting away from transport as an infrastructural phenomenon,

1308
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:21,740
for example, to a mobility as a social and political phenomenon

1309
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:25,180
that's an respective built on diverse disciplines

1310
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,340
from sociology and political studies to a geography

1311
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:30,140
and anthropology.

1312
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,700
And it really explores a lot of issues

1313
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:36,420
cultural studies scholars for example, would deal with looking at a number of phenomena happening in

1314
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:41,380
cities. So different representations and meanings of mobility, sensations, experiencing

1315
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:46,180
experiences of mobility. Everything that happens on this might for level of what people,

1316
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:53,220
what kind of practices and norms are being observable, being practiced in mobility related spaces

1317
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:58,820
in public transport for example, in these pedestrian areas. What cultural codes and norms are related

1318
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:07,380
to optimability. The problem with this particular approach is that well it looks very much at the

1319
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:13,140
micro level and whenever it engages with structural issues around mobility it runs the risk of

1320
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:18,180
being quite descriptive. So it mentions a number of issues, race, class, inequality but there is not

1321
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:23,060
so much over methodological depth in terms of exploring these issues. And also it's a constant that

1322
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:25,660
that is quite Western in a sense that they developed

1323
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:29,180
in the global north and in rather specific areas of it.

1324
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:33,220
And it only now starts engaging with situations

1325
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:36,220
with empirical context, indigo global stuff.

1326
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:43,260
Another approach, another avenue for doing critical research

1327
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:48,260
by the trust of mobility is building on the traditions

1328
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:50,420
of urban political economy of transport, right?

1329
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:54,020
So looking at the city as a social and political construct,

1330
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:57,180
which by no means, by in no way,

1331
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:01,140
is governed by some rational laws of supply and demand,

1332
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,060
like in the new classical paradigm,

1333
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:07,740
or which does not really look at people as consumers

1334
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:11,380
that have to be convinced to drop or to disengage

1335
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:15,300
from unwelcome or bad type of behavior

1336
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,860
and standing engaging in good type of behavior.

1337
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:25,860
But rather looking at people at urban inhabitants as political agents who do not make just rational decisions in terms of how they move,

1338
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:34,860
but have a political potential to shape the urban reality, to change how transport and mobility is organized in the locality in this city.

1339
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:43,860
And when you look at critical urban geography and a lot of names that I'm sure you've already heard or maybe even read from before,

1340
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:47,060
David Harvey, Neil Smith, Edward Sarger,

1341
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:51,380
Dave all contributed to conceptualizing

1342
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:53,340
to exploring this lane between

1343
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:54,820
and for structural development

1344
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:57,700
and social spatial distribution of public services.

1345
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:02,700
So transport has been there to analyze

1346
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,020
the critical development of the city.

1347
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:09,940
But absolutely foundational readings there

1348
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:13,140
or the first step towards critically exploring

1349
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,620
the relationship between the transport and density,

1350
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:18,180
come from feminist geographers who would arrive

1351
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,380
and that's the reading that you also,

1352
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:23,060
I think was assigned for today.

1353
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:27,060
Susan Hansen's work on deconstructing this

1354
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:29,780
behind the divide between the home and work

1355
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:34,780
and attaching women with domestic situations

1356
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:41,540
and apparently imagining them as less mobile beings

1357
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:50,700
while attaching this mobility potential to predominantly male subjects and male situations.

1358
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:59,180
And also, well, a very important part of that is to understand the homework

1359
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:04,620
relationship in the homework commute, which I mentioned last week is absolutely the most

1360
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:10,780
well, it's a foundational focus of transport geographers, analyzing these mobility

1361
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:17,020
patterns related to the move from work to home. The feminist geographers already in 1980s

1362
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:24,060
demonstrated that this way of looking at transport and also this way of engaging mobility is

1363
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:29,900
fundamental for maintaining capital. This is something that is the cornerstone of the

1364
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:37,260
of the capitalist system in cities or outside of them. What emerges from this is understanding

1365
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:42,140
Transport and mobility is not just an infrastructural phenomenon or something that has some

1366
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:46,860
environmental repercussions and some social ones and here I'm thinking about sustainable approach

1367
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:56,300
to mobility, but as essentially a form of capital, mobility is a potential that is unevenly

1368
01:30:56,300 --> 01:31:03,100
distributed as any form of capital around a cross-society across its different spaces and across

1369
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:09,660
it's classes, which leads to understanding and challenging different structures, social, political,

1370
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:15,820
economic, that stand behind what makes transport unsustainable in the first place. So it's really

1371
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:21,020
asking you a question why are people moving in particular ways not because they are used to a

1372
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:25,100
particular lifestyle because they have some cultural norms but understanding a political and

1373
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:30,860
economic system that enables, for instance, the domination of the car and trying to address the

1374
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:35,620
the system as a result rather than looking at how people can be convinced and

1375
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:39,740
all how situation in terms of mobility can be changed in specific areas of the city.

1376
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:43,580
It's looking at things much more, much more broadly, much more structural always.

1377
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:52,220
Right. So, and here I attached the geography to the end of this, to this slide.

1378
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:54,980
So you can look at these different studies if you, if you're interested in

1379
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,420
transport and mobility.

1380
01:31:56,420 --> 01:32:00,340
There is a line of research that is looked at the transport

1381
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:05,660
and mobility as a way of reproducing existing social,

1382
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:09,500
political, economic interests, regulatory frameworks,

1383
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,500
power relations regulated by the market on the one hand

1384
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,540
and by the state, and very often contested by from the bottom

1385
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,660
up.

1386
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:21,020
There is a lot of research, for some reason,

1387
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:22,620
the references are not showing up.

1388
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,980
But if you're interested, I'm more than happy to send you

1389
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:27,620
that something is stranded with my slightly.

1390
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:31,900
But there isn't ongoing work already going back to the 1990s

1391
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:37,060
that shows how neoliberal policies that affect urban culture,

1392
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,460
provision of housing, urban environment,

1393
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:41,780
are also extremely present in provision of transport

1394
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:45,180
and mobility, how in a natural transport

1395
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:46,980
is increasingly commodified.

1396
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:48,860
And for example, congestion charging,

1397
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:50,460
and as I mentioned today, it's part of that.

1398
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:54,020
It's turning, and we could think public space

1399
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,320
that an urban motorway or an urban street

1400
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,700
is, it to a commodity that has an additional price

1401
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,780
that I can touch to it, which as we consume,

1402
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:05,180
we have to additionally pay for, depending,

1403
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,140
as I mentioned, not on our means, but basically

1404
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,700
on our demand.

1405
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:15,820
There is also a fundamental issue that many geographers dealt

1406
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:19,460
with, that is of transport related inequality

1407
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,940
and exclusion, so basically trying to understand,

1408
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:27,820
to what extent transport enables movement of some people

1409
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:30,780
while restricting that of others.

1410
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:33,020
This will skip.

1411
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:36,660
And of course, well, it might seem very obvious today,

1412
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:39,980
but if you look at what was being done in geography,

1413
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:42,500
now in geography or transport geography in the '80s,

1414
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,580
the '90s was definitely not the case.

1415
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:47,100
There is now a rise of research, which

1416
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:50,820
looks at the questions of class and the questions of race

1417
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:53,620
and the question of gender is absolutely fundamental

1418
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:58,420
for understanding transport systems in cities and beyond them.

1419
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:01,900
And one of them is this, well,

1420
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,620
maybe not such a foundational reading,

1421
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:06,500
but still something that is very important

1422
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,740
and really define the agenda of research

1423
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:13,300
into transport for at least this decade.

1424
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,140
Of course, there's more recent stuff

1425
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,180
that also has been written,

1426
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:18,900
but I think this is quite a nice introduction

1427
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:23,140
with the question of gender and mobility.

1428
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:27,540
And here, we see that as with the questions of race

1429
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:28,740
and the question with class, but this

1430
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,900
is something that was already quite established

1431
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:35,140
and if you'll already, there is an inseparable relationship

1432
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:37,220
between gender and mobility.

1433
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:40,340
That, on the one hand, transfer of mobility

1434
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,220
mean development or some kind of opening

1435
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,620
of accessibility to different opportunities,

1436
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:50,300
breaking this supposed paradigm of the domestic female

1437
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:53,380
and the work-related male, but actually mobility

1438
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:56,300
is something that opens this paradigm,

1439
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:59,780
that gender on the other hand affects travel reasons

1440
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:01,780
and patterns in terms of the complexity,

1441
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:04,300
in terms of the frequency and regularity,

1442
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:08,020
and in terms of why actually people engage in movement,

1443
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:10,180
why is they actually move around the city?

1444
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:13,860
And perhaps one critique that could be made

1445
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:19,860
the paper that I ask you to read for today is that the approaches women as a rather unified category

1446
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:28,020
that can be maybe not reduced but summarized in terms of particular mobility patterns that

1447
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:35,940
half of humanity engages. I think that's a little bit risky always. But what clearly I think is

1448
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:42,020
interesting in this kind of line of work, as I said, there is a definite follow-up and work that

1449
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:45,860
explore these questions in much more detail and it's much more fine to you to

1450
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:51,540
sophisticated. But we see that without considering the agenda component we

1451
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:56,660
basically missed the fact that in many urban contexts women engaged in a

1452
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:00,660
completely different way with mobility. They conduct trips which are

1453
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:05,940
much more complex, regular because they quite simply are related to

1454
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:09,940
diverse, care-related activities. They would be much more inclined or

1455
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:18,740
or perhaps forced to bring other people along to act as drivers for other passengers,

1456
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:26,260
and because they engage in quite simply more activities than male subjects.

1457
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:29,300
In this way, I'm simplifying here, of course, a whole lot,

1458
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,660
but this way of approaching transport and mobility,

1459
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:35,660
uncovers not only differences in terms of how people move,

1460
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:39,500
but differences in terms of power relations that are there behind movement

1461
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:45,580
and transport, which in my humble opinion is maybe a little bit there in sustainable

1462
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:50,220
approaches to mobility, but it's quite simply not pronounced enough or it does not really show us

1463
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:57,820
in full depth the the multi-level structure of power relations that are there behind

1464
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:07,980
behind transport and mobility. Now what's left, we are running out of time so I don't

1465
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:13,420
don't want to talk about everything, but what's also important to remember is that, well,

1466
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:19,820
besides questions of transport workers, because so far we've basically talked mostly, if not

1467
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:25,820
only about passenger transport users, people who use transport. There's a question of transport

1468
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:31,900
labour, but also very importantly, a lot of research done on transport and mobility is a vehicle

1469
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:35,980
for some contestation, discontent and struggle.

1470
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:40,100
And I started these two sessions with Greta Tundberg,

1471
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:43,100
with protests in Chile and other places.

1472
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:47,500
And year in, year out, sometimes month in month out,

1473
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:51,900
you see that transport is used as a very important subject

1474
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:55,900
for a lot of very diverse movements and social groups

1475
01:37:55,900 --> 01:38:00,140
to express the discontent with whatever it is.

1476
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:02,900
sometimes quite directly capitalist system,

1477
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,780
and that's the case with Gilles-Jon,

1478
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:08,000
who quite symbolically would occupy

1479
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,300
roundabouts across rural or suburban France,

1480
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:15,300
and sometimes symbolically,

1481
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,940
and that's an East Jerusalem,

1482
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:21,580
Palestinian activists attacking the light rail,

1483
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:22,940
and kind of traumway stations,

1484
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:26,300
as a symbol of Israeli colonization in East Jerusalem.

1485
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,660
Sometimes this would be protest against

1486
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:35,100
some kind of the surface level policy, like the increase of public transport fares or policing

1487
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:40,860
and that's the case in New York City, or the construction of one of these underground parkings

1488
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:45,980
related to the Piotonier that would add to the number of parking spots in the city while

1489
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:53,260
supposedly actually opening the city for the for the people. This we will have to skip.

1490
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:59,180
The very last point that I want to make today, I mean I still would like to give us maybe

1491
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:03,020
10 minutes for your questions and maybe some comments.

1492
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:06,060
If you still have energy to do that,

1493
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:08,700
is that, and that's perhaps related a little bit

1494
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:11,060
to this question of neoliberalization of transpose

1495
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:14,380
and mobility, is that what we see is that

1496
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:18,300
despite these different theoretical approaches

1497
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:21,060
and critical questions that people,

1498
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:23,660
critical geographers are asking,

1499
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:27,580
we see a process of standardization

1500
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:29,100
of transport policies.

1501
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,540
So if you are a transport engineer and transport economist today,

1502
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:37,300
there is really distancing towards unifying experiences

1503
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:40,340
of different cities into a portfolio of best practices,

1504
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:43,420
which are then transferable from one or currently

1505
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:44,260
to another.

1506
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:45,900
There's a huge business behind it,

1507
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:51,060
and not only in terms of think towns and big consultancy firms,

1508
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,620
but a whole flurry of events,

1509
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:56,020
which you can learn from experiences of others,

1510
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:59,060
which you can learn about what your city should be doing.

1511
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:03,060
And some scholars have engaged with that,

1512
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:05,560
studying specifically the policy mobility

1513
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:08,020
of these best practices and recipes

1514
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:10,720
in the field of urban transport.

1515
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:14,160
But what's perhaps quite important to be to be added to this

1516
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:19,160
is that, well, the story of policy transfer is quite long.

1517
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:22,300
I mean, the tradition of deploying Western worldviews,

1518
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:25,780
Eurocentric concepts and theories and methods

1519
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:27,820
in a more or less unchanged way

1520
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:32,300
in some other geographical contexts in Africa, Asia, Latin America,

1521
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:38,220
is a very long story and the story as a name and its colonisation of coloniality.

1522
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:47,420
And this is something that really is there to be done by the future generation of critical geographers,

1523
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:52,300
or the transport geographers, or urban geographers. Is that of decolonising this body of knowledge

1524
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:59,100
which pretty much everything that I have referred to in these two sessions comes very much

1525
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:05,820
from the global north that reflects my own education, that's something that I think I still have

1526
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:11,820
to do myself, is to really start looking at transport reality and start defining,

1527
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:17,740
formulating questions about this reality in terms of transit mobility, not from our global

1528
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:20,500
will know them perspective, but also that of the South.

1529
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:24,940
And just again, it's just a simple example

1530
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:27,340
of what this could mean in practice,

1531
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:32,060
is looking at the question of informality in transport,

1532
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:34,380
which traditionally, that's a slide from one

1533
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:38,100
of these classic reports commissioned,

1534
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,340
I think either by UN or the World Bank

1535
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:44,660
on informal transport, looks at informality in transport

1536
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:47,100
as something that means bad quality,

1537
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:51,380
in terms of safety of passengers, speeding, environmental impact,

1538
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:54,420
basically some alt-ricutty vehicles,

1539
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:59,260
which are a way to be transformed into modern, Western,

1540
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:03,020
formal public transport system.

1541
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:06,140
The kind of we know from northern cities, like Brussels

1542
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:11,140
or many others in Belgium, France or Germany, whatnot.

1543
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:14,740
But, and that's something that has been done quite recently

1544
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:22,580
is in process, is actually understanding our experience of transport and mobility in our formal

1545
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:27,140
environments is very much something that can be informed by these informal experiences of the

1546
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:34,420
Google South. An example, well, if you ever are at Garlic Media these days unfortunately this practice

1547
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:41,700
is on hold because of you know what, there is a flurry maybe not but at least a few informal

1548
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:48,100
transport practices that you can find in the Galdimi area, these informal taxis, vans that bring

1549
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:55,380
passengers informally somewhat illegally from the south station to Sharlowar Airport to the

1550
01:42:55,380 --> 01:43:02,260
Brussels south Sharlowar Airport and to Paris, which exhibit very strong similarity with

1551
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:08,820
many other informal practices that you can find in cities across South Asia, Africa and Latin America.

1552
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:14,500
And then finally, while these practices of course attract whenever they do, they attract very negative

1553
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:19,940
attention of the media, of the police, they have treated as something that is illegal and be unfair

1554
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:27,380
to formal regulators that pay taxes and have to operate within the legal framework of, in this case,

1555
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:34,900
the Brussels capital region, there is, and here we go back to the beginning of the first session,

1556
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:38,660
A number of practices which are proposed by the transport industry,

1557
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:42,820
transfer the mobility industry, Uber and many other app-based practices,

1558
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:49,060
which are essentially informal practices, which try to operate in the insertices of the system,

1559
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:55,780
somewhat legal, but also not to the full extent. If you think, for example, about what Uber does

1560
01:43:55,780 --> 01:44:01,860
to its workers or what is the spatial impact, if we can put this way or these

1561
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:08,260
East Kudos, which operate in public space, but very often literally occupy the space, the paving

1562
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:15,540
and whatnot, without necessarily making this system officially legal or recognised.

1563
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:24,420
Well, here we pause our little write of two sessions. I apologise for this bit of a fast

1564
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:29,540
pace ending to the second session, but I realise that we run out of time for discussing

1565
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:34,260
things a little bit more detailed way, but we still have eight minutes for some

1566
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:38,900
questions if you have them, maybe some points that you you have in your in your

1567
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:44,580
head right now something that you want to share. This is the moment.

1568
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:48,860
And maybe I'll stop sharing my slides.

1569
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:59,100
Do you have some questions, some comments?

1570
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:18,100
Well, it's perfectly fine if you don't, of course.

1571
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:21,100
I mean, it's quite late in the day I understand it.

1572
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:29,100
And it's definitely a suboptimal experience to do that through Zoom or any of these platforms.

1573
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:35,100
Oh, right.

1574
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:40,100
Vitaly is asking about transport labour.

1575
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:42,100
There's also one more technical question.

1576
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:50,100
Well, quite simply the concept of transport labour looks at labour relations and conditions in transport.

1577
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:54,860
is trying to change the emphasis a little bit.

1578
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:56,220
I mean, if you look at the literature

1579
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:59,340
on the neoclassical or sustainable side,

1580
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:04,340
and the dominant focus of, I would really say,

1581
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:07,700
99% of the studies is on the passenger

1582
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:11,140
or the driver or the consumer.

1583
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:15,780
The question of what working conditions

1584
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:18,140
are shift to sustainable transport intervals, for example,

1585
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:20,420
It's very rarely asked.

1586
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:26,860
And that I think can lead us into some dead end situations,

1587
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:30,180
in which, for example, we really give a lot of hope

1588
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:32,180
and we build a lot of expectations

1589
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:34,180
towards some ability practices like Uber,

1590
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:37,660
like the electric scooters or whatnot,

1591
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:39,980
without really understanding that,

1592
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:42,860
and that comes from transport-level literature,

1593
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:45,140
that the main innovation that Uber brings to the table

1594
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:49,380
perhaps is not connecting drivers and users,

1595
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,500
because it existed before.

1596
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:54,540
And I mean, informal transport without the app, of course.

1597
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:58,780
But it exists in most cities in the world,

1598
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:00,180
in a global, some global nodes

1599
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,740
and cities being an exception rather than rule.

1600
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:06,420
But the actual innovation is degrading

1601
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,860
transport, degrading working relations

1602
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:11,300
to end of the 19th century.

1603
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,900
Basically, a worker has very few rights.

1604
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:17,140
doesn't have to write the unionized collectively bargain.

1605
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:19,300
And it's not even recognized as a worker.

1606
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:23,660
It's basically some kind of free atom contractor

1607
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:28,660
who in spare leisure time engages in driving people

1608
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:32,660
around the city, which we all know from now

1609
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:35,500
the whole body of work on Uber is definitely not the case.

1610
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:38,340
And these people are full-time workers,

1611
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:41,340
not just hubists who try to make some spare money

1612
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:42,340
on the side.

1613
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:45,340
So yes.

1614
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:48,340
That's what's transport labor is about.

1615
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:50,340
Some technical questions.

1616
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,340
Let's address those.

1617
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:52,340
For the next discussion,

1618
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:56,340
Seminar is at the same way of working with PowerPoint and voice over.

1619
01:47:56,340 --> 01:48:01,340
Well, the way I understand you did it in other discussion

1620
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:04,340
Seminuses that you basically recorded your presentation,

1621
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:06,340
which then either you sent to me,

1622
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:09,340
I think that's probably a better solution.

1623
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:14,840
solution and we basically listen to and then we have a discussion in which you facilitate

1624
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:20,340
it, right, as those who discuss the paper. So it's not exactly a voiceover. I mean,

1625
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:25,380
so you don't present the PowerPoint's life, the ideas that you pre-record the presentation

1626
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:33,220
with your fellow students. And will the exam be online as well? Yes, the exam will be

1627
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:38,260
online and we are meeting with Basnik and David to discuss exactly how this will be

1628
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:44,380
down most likely will be in well obviously since we will not be in your rooms it

1629
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:49,020
will be an open book exam so you will have access to the slides and all that so

1630
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:53,260
but since we haven't done that before it will be a classic exam we are

1631
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:57,460
discussing how to do this so that it's challenging enough for you and also

1632
01:48:57,460 --> 01:49:05,900
not too difficult right so it's with the voice of an indeed. Has the Belgian

1633
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:09,900
Brussels government have taken any action to prevent informal transportation. Do you know how

1634
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:14,460
relaxed they are towards this? Well actually I researched these navets as they quote.

1635
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:21,660
"Nelgo from midi to the shallower airport and no, the Brussels government is definitely not happy

1636
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:30,220
about these informal tax, the situation there is that these men, all of them are are are are

1637
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:37,180
Cameo, official taxi drivers, so they have a taxi license, but what they basically do is that

1638
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:44,300
make more money, they offer individual seats in the vans and they taxi. And that's precisely what's

1639
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:50,780
illegal. So you cannot, as a taxi driver in Brussels, you cannot basically stand there on the street

1640
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:56,780
and try to approach potential passengers, offering them individual places in the car.

1641
01:49:56,780 --> 01:49:58,780
It has to be the whole car that is rented.

1642
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:05,580
Well, it's a bit ironic, but what happened a few years after this practice

1643
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:10,140
got into the focus of, I don't want to say, public debate, but basically these drivers

1644
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:13,260
started being harassed by police and there was a legal procedure against them.

1645
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:19,660
Flitco, I don't know if that name rings a bell. It's a company that runs the official bus

1646
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:25,980
from me to Shalawa Airport, started exactly that. So they're basically now

1647
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:31,420
offer well now it's standard but they started offering a van service which goes door to gate

1648
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:36,460
as it's called and it picks individual passengers and individual seats are offered. And for

1649
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:44,540
some reason this is perfectly legal whereas the taxi drivers are partly engaging in an illegal activity.

1650
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:55,820
So just as a rebound you know why Flipkuh implemented this in a non-competitive way

1651
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:59,820
why I mean is that they're actually more expensive than the Navet,

1652
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:06,460
they're like informal and a bit. Because I think they have a very different customer target.

1653
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:11,980
So people who would take a Navet, that's also from my own work, they would be very often

1654
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:16,140
of immigrant backgrounds, so there's a lot of people from Eastern Europe, from Maccribe,

1655
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:21,420
who are quite simply used to do this mode of transport for them. This is a very common thing to see

1656
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:26,300
and use in the country of origin.

1657
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:29,380
And also, the drivers of the Navet

1658
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:32,340
would basically find the customers on the spot itself.

1659
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:33,780
So you walked towards the bus.

1660
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:35,380
I don't know if you've ever had that experience.

1661
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:41,380
But whenever I had to walk to the bus of Flikko,

1662
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:45,180
they would try to approach you and convince you to write with them.

1663
01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:48,460
Whereas I think people who use the internet

1664
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:52,340
with access to a website who can know how to book a ride,

1665
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:57,340
with a credit card to book a right, that's a different target group.

1666
01:51:57,340 --> 01:52:02,580
So maybe that's why if people can offer prices

1667
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:05,580
which are not exactly competitive on the economic front.

1668
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:11,980
Well, what it means that's the last sentence about an event

1669
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:14,580
is that informality in this case,

1670
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:17,100
it's some kind of a front for, in this case,

1671
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:20,180
state institutions to define what's legal or not.

1672
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:23,300
I mean, for them to decide that the naviet,

1673
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:26,700
this informal drivers are informal and therefore legal.

1674
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,340
I mean, it's an arbitrary decision

1675
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:31,980
to decide that this is informal, whereas Uber is formal.

1676
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:35,500
Or actually in the case of Uber,

1677
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,380
and Brussels authorities,

1678
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:41,140
the regional authorities pretend that Uber does not exist.

1679
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:42,900
So they don't chase it away,

1680
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:44,060
but they also don't promote it,

1681
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:46,900
which is a perfect playground for Uber.

1682
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:49,620
They are, they, that's exactly what they want.

1683
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:55,740
They are not interested in being recognized as an official public transport service, for

1684
01:52:55,740 --> 01:53:00,540
example, because that would mean having to comply with a lot of regulations, which they

1685
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:05,020
are of course not interested in complying with.

1686
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:11,820
In your research about this, do you know if like Uber drivers partner up with the like

1687
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:18,180
informal Navet drivers to actually try convince clients to use the informal Navet rather

1688
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:20,260
than the Flipkop for example.

1689
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:22,180
No, I don't know.

1690
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:23,860
In this particular case, they definitely not.

1691
01:53:23,860 --> 01:53:27,660
I mean, the event drivers, as most taxi traffic

1692
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,940
and bus will be hate over, they really

1693
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:32,340
don't like that it exists because it basically

1694
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:34,980
eats into the market.

1695
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:39,300
I'm not saying that taxi drivers here are some angels

1696
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:47,220
and most, I don't know, fun people to work with or on,

1697
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:53,660
But they can also offer services which are overpriced

1698
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:57,260
and try to rip off tourists and all of our young people

1699
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:01,140
who come back home intoxicated by taking a very long route

1700
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:01,780
or whatever.

1701
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:03,340
With Uber, of course, the advantages

1702
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,900
that you know the price before you get into the car,

1703
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,580
more or less.

1704
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:10,380
But in this case, no, there's definitely no collaboration.

1705
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:15,140
I've said that there is some conflict even.

1706
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:17,140
You've probably heard about not already

1707
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:19,700
happened at least three times massive strikes

1708
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:23,500
of taxi drivers against some kind of effort

1709
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:26,940
towards regularizing Uber by the Russell's

1710
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:28,780
and capital region authorities.

1711
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:36,740
Any more questions, comments?

1712
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:40,780
Well, it also goes without saying that at some point

1713
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:44,980
will be picking topics for your master thesis.

1714
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:47,740
And you are very welcome to pick some related

1715
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:50,460
to transport and mobility, either supervised by me

1716
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:51,180
or by other people.

1717
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:54,860
There is some more in our team and in different departments

1718
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:55,220
as well.

1719
01:54:55,220 --> 01:55:01,340
But I don't know if I succeeded, probably to some extent,

1720
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:03,540
but not fully.

1721
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:06,580
But if there was one thing that I really wanted you

1722
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:08,620
to understand about transport and mobility

1723
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:11,860
is that at least from the critical geographical perspective,

1724
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:13,740
it's a really, really diverse field.

1725
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,740
There's plenty of things to do.

1726
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:19,100
And there's plenty of interesting things to do.

1727
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:24,100
So I really look forward to seeing your research topics

1728
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:26,980
and hope that at least some of them will be related

1729
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:28,260
to transport availability.

1730
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:32,060
If you need some little push or some encouragement,

1731
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:34,060
we are always there to help you with finding

1732
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:37,540
some interesting literature for inspiration or whatnot.

1733
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:42,340
So, I really, really hope we meet in person one day.

1734
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:45,540
I hope it's not too far in the future.

1735
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:47,980
I really hope that we can do an excursion,

1736
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:50,620
even though it's on the transport, it's interesting.

1737
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:55,620
People say, so voila, I really hope that we can do that

1738
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:58,860
in March, April, May, the latest.

1739
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:03,860
So, until then, I wish you all the best with everything

1740
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:05,780
and with the exam.

1741
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:13,940
Good luck. Don't get discouraged by this online paradigm. It will be away soon. I hope.

1742
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:20,180
So we will be in touch with you about the exam. Don't worry about it.

1743
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:23,060
Enjoy. See you later.

1744
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:32,180
