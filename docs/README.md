00:00:48
All right, welcome everybody to

00:00:52
Urban Geography Urban Social Geography.

00:00:56
I had to work a little bit to make the live stream work.

00:00:57
I hope it does work.

00:01:02
Does anybody mind if I take off my mask?

00:01:04
Is that okay?

00:01:09
If anybody's uncomfortable, just let me know.

00:01:14
But I rely on my facial expressions for content.

00:01:17
How do you say that to transfer content, if you will?

00:01:22
So hi, I'm David for your lecture.

00:01:24
And welcome to the course.

00:01:31
I'm very glad that we can teach and have this in real life

00:01:32
in person.

00:01:37
We'll tell you more about the kind of hybrid character,

00:01:40
because we'll also be recording the sessions

00:01:42
and live streaming the session.

00:01:46
So I think the pandemic conditions are still

00:01:51
ongoing to allow if you would doubt

00:01:56
about any infection, et cetera, to follow the course remotely.

00:02:03
I think this can be more evident for the regular lectures like we have today.

00:02:06
There is also a number of discussions seminars.

00:02:11
There will be less evidence and there's also excursions for some there.

00:02:18
I mean, I can't stream an excursion, but for the lectures it will be now turned.

00:02:23
And you also have the recording at the end of the lecture series.

00:02:27
and this could be an interesting instrument to study.

00:02:32
So yeah, that also has students have used it last year.

00:02:37
Okay, so what are the objectives of the entire course,

00:02:39
urban geography, urban social geography?

00:02:41
Well, just summed up there.

00:02:45
I won't go too deep into this just here and now.

00:02:48
But just that you know what you're signing up for,

00:02:52
for the people that are still shopping around,

00:02:54
around, I would say.

00:02:57
The objective of the course is to give an introduction

00:03:00
to key theoretical debates in urban studies,

00:03:06
nor specifically focusing on spatial and geographical dimensions,

00:03:09
hence it's not introduction to urban studies

00:03:13
but introduction to urban geography.

00:03:16
And this is kind of signaling what

00:03:21
we find important as lecturers to adopt a theoretically

00:03:24
It's your list of approach to work urban studies.

00:03:26
You'll see that, and I'll get to that in a second,

00:03:29
that we work with different teachers, lectures.

00:03:31
We all have their own backgrounds,

00:03:32
and they may be slightly different.

00:03:34
Some people work more on political economy,

00:03:39
perspective, others start from adopting a perspective

00:03:41
from diversity and ethnicity,

00:03:46
yet others are interested in issues of culture,

00:03:50
in the broad sense, and always work in a kind of mobility framework.

00:03:55
I'm going to try to bring those things together in one course.

00:03:57
But what is kind of uniting the course,

00:04:00
I think a spatial social spatial understanding

00:04:03
of contemporary cities.

00:04:05
So that's what you're signing up for.

00:04:10
If you hate 50s, this is the moment to leave the room.

00:04:12
I told you so.

00:04:17
So this is the old male panel that we present to my

00:04:23
in serious apologies, but I think that hopefully diversity, of course the curriculum is a bit

00:04:32
better than within this course, but we're selecting from the people that can teach so please accept

00:04:39
my apologies for that, but still we hope that we can inform you from the range of perspectives.

00:04:45
Also, including I would say feminist perspectives, and they will pop up here and there,

00:04:52
especially when we start talking about issues of culture and issues of mobility and

00:05:05
trans

00:05:09
Bosom Hörf, he's an expert, you could say,

00:05:12
creative industries, cultural geographies of the cities,

00:05:17
of the city, Poitek Geblowski, he wrote a PhD

00:05:20
on fair free public transportation,

00:05:25
and he's an expert in urban studies, slash transportation

00:05:29
geographies, and recently he's really pushing

00:05:34
for a kind of decolonial agenda in transport geographies.

00:05:36
And finally, there's me.

00:05:38
I won't say I'm an expert in editing.

00:05:42
I'm an expert in coordinating this course by now.

00:05:46
And I come from a background of world and global cities.

00:05:50
So what happens to cities, a mid-globalization,

00:05:53
how should we study that, analyze that,

00:05:55
well, I mean, debate.

00:05:58
Conversely, I've been looking a lot into the geographies

00:06:03
of Islamic finance as a way to understand,

00:06:07
I would say Middle Eastern processes of urbanization.

00:06:08
But that was my PhD.

00:06:10
Currently, I'm more working in teams

00:06:14
around financial companies, more widely thinking about

00:06:18
what typifies global cities as command and controls.

00:06:21
There's all kinds of things that I'll be killing you with

00:06:22
in the next few sessions.

00:06:25
So I won't say anything more about that.

00:06:27
So that's the teaching team.

00:06:31
And so there's plural voices to some extent.

00:06:36
And also there's also a plural audience.

00:06:40
So I was already referring to group students

00:06:43
by pointing to that this is the urban social geography course,

00:06:46
but also it's also the urban geography course.

00:06:49
And there's slight differences between both courses,

00:06:53
but especially for the lectures that

00:06:57
makes complete sense to bring you together in the room.

00:06:59
So we have the master in urban studies.

00:07:01
It will be master.

00:07:03
Please raise your hands and voices.

00:07:07
Okay, thanks for the hands.

00:07:10
This for citizens.

00:07:14
Yeah, so that's even more exotic.

00:07:17
These people travel around Europe in the next two years.

00:07:22
Then we have our own exotic species

00:07:24
from the Bachelor of Geography.

00:07:26
Maybe raise your hand.

00:07:29
Welcome.

00:07:33
And we also have urbanists in the room.

00:07:36
So please show me where you are.

00:07:40
These people also combine us with an actual job.

00:07:45
So that's also why we teach at night to accommodate that.

00:07:48
And these are people that have quite a bit of professional expertise.

00:07:56
So I would say this is already a global urban map here confined in this room.

00:08:03
I would say enjoy this mix and try to pick each other's brains as much as possible.

00:08:08
They're just by comparing urban experiences, concasal conversation.

00:08:12
You can already learn quite a bit.

00:08:21
So similarities, all students have lectures and discussion seminars.

00:08:24
This discussion seminar for capacity reasons will be split.

00:08:26
I'll tell you more about that.

00:08:29
For urban social geographers, so that's

00:08:32
for the mouse and urban cities and for citizens,

00:08:35
we're kind of new to Belgium.

00:08:38
We also offer kinds of excursions.

00:08:40
And I'll say more about that as well.

00:08:42
And these are mandatory.

00:08:44
And, follow.

00:08:50
So how does the course look like there's nine lectures,

00:08:54
which we will try to make as interactive as possible.

00:08:58
but there will be a degree of me and us telling you stuff.

00:09:02
The discussion seminars will be way more flipped,

00:09:06
if you will, where the content is prepared by you

00:09:09
and then we discussed this in the classroom.

00:09:13
So it's a bit of a give and take there.

00:09:17
We organized the lectures in modules.

00:09:20
So you can say this for modules.

00:09:24
One organized by me, which deals with

00:09:31
general introduction as you note today and then we'll delve into theories of world

00:09:36
and global cities looking at what explains their genesis what their

00:09:43
characteristics are, why matters and what kind of the main processes are that

00:09:48
characterize urban societies in world and global cities and one of the main

00:09:57
the base there is to what extent are these places polarized, either in terms of ethnicity,

00:10:06
income levels, professional levels, etc. With that sensitivity, I would say to an evenness

00:10:13
within cities, I'll pass on the word to Nick Schuirmont, who focus more on processes of urban

00:10:19
segregation, we're looking at the spatial processes behind that and one of the main debates

00:10:27
I would say in issues of diversity and ethnicity is to what extent there are neighborhood effects.

00:10:35
It is the fact that you live within a neighborhood affecting your future trajectories,

00:10:41
like chances, etc. So that's one of the main debates there and this

00:10:46
pros and cons, there's arguments for and against the existence of neighborhood effects.

00:10:54
Then we pass on to Bosch von Hüd, who will be talking about, you could say, the cultural approach,

00:11:02
thinking about different cultures of urban research. And so this deals with various methods,

00:11:09
and mostly what you could say, an older cultural turn within geography and social sciences,

00:11:12
more widely, which was took place after Second World War.

00:11:15
And then more recently in the 80s and 90s,

00:11:17
to the real cultural turn where

00:11:22
was all about a turn towards more qualitative research methods,

00:11:25
other sources that could be studied

00:11:27
and that could serve the study

00:11:29
of urban societies.

00:11:32
And then this is also mobilized in the study

00:11:35
of urban culture, where it's about creative industries,

00:11:37
the lives of artists, et cetera,

00:11:40
which is a big element in a lot of,

00:11:42
say, this course is on the creative city.

00:11:45
As you may know, the work of Richard Florida,

00:11:48
it was a whole hype, I would say, 20 years ago

00:11:52
that all cities should be geared toward becoming creative

00:11:53
in one way or another.

00:11:57
So hence, also, a large focus and literature

00:12:00
on issues of ISP culture,

00:12:03
as it is connected to the shoes of urban development.

00:12:09
And then the final part is with Voigtek Blobsky,

00:12:14
looking into the lens of transport and mobility

00:12:17
at what we can learn about cities.

00:12:21
And he will be talking about different kinds of agendas

00:12:24
that typify, I would say,

00:12:28
transpities all the way from your classical views

00:12:33
that connected to urban growth development

00:12:37
to sustainability issues, which is a paradigm in an open zone.

00:12:41
And then he'll be drawing on his own research,

00:12:44
looking more into what he calls critical perspectives

00:12:47
on urban transport, where it's all about, yeah,

00:12:51
who actually benefits from the current transportation regime,

00:12:56
what are issues of inequality, who makes decisions

00:12:58
about in transport systems, I'd say.

00:13:02
So I think by the end, you should have a kind of

00:13:12
360 degree overview of debates in urban geography obviously. We don't know everything far from that.

00:13:19
So it's a selection of debates. We could generate another curriculum based with other forms of

00:13:27
expertise. But it's also an exercise in trying to critically try and relate different perspectives

00:13:33
on the city to different kind of teams which come with your own methodologies etc. So that's the

00:13:41
setup of the course and these take place here. You're just about fit in this room so I'm extremely

00:13:50
happy and pleased and we'll take place on Mondays between five and seven. Let's see what the quality

00:13:56
of the streaming is. If I would open for nocto which is my program I could expect a stream of

00:14:02
comments about that. But so I'll evaluate that but the idea is that everything is

00:14:08
streamed as well. People that come make it because of conflicts with work or

00:14:14
well they might have time but can't reach VB because it's immediately after

00:14:20
the working day I mean I would understand that you would yeah follow

00:14:27
remotely and sessions will also be recorded. On the other hand, it's a kind of

00:14:33
strict recommendation to try to be here as much as possible because I mean one of

00:14:39
the insights from the corona crisis, yeah, when you watch remotely, sometimes it's

00:14:45
hard to maintain discipline. I also recognize that with all kinds of Zoom meetings

00:14:53
and Zoom. I don't know, seven hours. So having a habit of coming to VDB, coming to class,

00:14:58
I think it's also a way to stay connected, but I don't know to the course content, but also to one

00:15:07
another. So you could fall back on this, but I would not recommend a full digital semester in any case.

00:15:10
So, but it's there and it will be your resource.

00:15:13
It all goes well at the very end.

00:15:16
So, yeah, we're here.

00:15:20
A bit more on the discussion seminar.

00:15:22
So, yes, please, there was a question.

00:15:28
(indistinct)

00:15:32
Yeah, it's to have some slack in this room.

00:15:34
We'll aim for two hours,

00:15:38
But we already started like five minutes late today.

00:15:44
So don't be upset if we take until 10 past seven.

00:15:47
But the idea is that it would be two hours.

00:15:49
Yeah, depends if the tone on what happens.

00:15:50
Yes?

00:15:53
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:54
Excuse me?

00:15:54
Sorry.

00:15:56
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:02
Yes, I'll post them online after each session.

00:16:07
Yeah, and if you go to the GUMVA stage and I guess some of you are not yet

00:16:15
be able to access convos that should be resorted quite soon. You'll see at the starting page

00:16:22
I made all kinds of modules as a kind of an outline module and there's a module per session

00:16:25
where you'll see

00:16:28
the required readings, some additional readings,

00:16:33
I'll post a link to, you know, I won't do it there.

00:16:36
I'll post a link to the recordings and the announcements.

00:16:41
There will be session slides linked to each of these modules.

00:16:46
So, I mean, I think it's neatly organized so you should find your way there.

00:16:52
Basically, all content will be provided online for people that cannot access

00:17:02
convos yet. Please find somebody who has access and try to share, I would say the course outline.

00:17:09
So please be aware that some of you don't have access yet. I think by next week it should be

00:17:19
okay. So yeah, let's see. So yeah, next in the lectures there's discussion seminars where we

00:17:27
basically use the reader to advance our insight into these discussions around urban geography.

00:17:32
And we take the various modules, so four modules, and we organize that in one block,

00:17:38
where we'll have a discussion which is basically prepared by you all in different kind of

00:17:44
smaller presentations, and then we have a collective discussion about that. It's also in the

00:17:49
an outline. So it's a different kind of series of discussion seminars because you can't

00:17:56
have a debate with 200 people in the room. So it's more like a classroom format, one

00:18:02
for the master in urban studies, one track for four cities, and then also one for geography

00:18:09
first and urbanists in one go. For must and for cities, it won't be on Mondays, it's

00:18:11
some different times during the week.

00:18:14
It's in your time schedule.

00:18:18
Please check if you've already identified

00:18:20
where the time schedule is.

00:18:23
Also where the week information is.

00:18:25
And try to notice down in your agenda,

00:18:28
because there will be an assignment later that, a small one.

00:18:31
But I would say an important one.

00:18:32
Please note that down in your agenda.

00:18:49
Also note that the lectures at some point will have three lectures now, but then we will skip one week before we go to the next module, then two classes, then we skip one week, etc, etc.

00:19:02
And it is because on certain Mondays after module will have a discussion seminar with geographers and urbanists because it's, we can't expect work students to be here during the day.

00:19:07
So we will take these Mondays and also please take notes for

00:19:13
most enforcities that you don't have to show up for, I would say, four sessions

00:19:19
on Mondays. I mean you're welcome to join, but there will be no lectures, there

00:19:23
will be discussion seminars for a not a group, okay? Just so you know, it could be a

00:19:27
week also to prepare another bit more for the discussion seminar that you

00:19:33
you may have yourself. Okay, I'll say more about the assignment linked to that in

00:19:39
seconds. Then urban social geography excursions, there's a lot of administration here apparently.

00:19:46
We offer four excursions but because of the size of the group this is for must and for cities

00:19:56
will have to, yeah, force you to make a choice. So there's four excursions, one led by me,

00:19:59
and here in Brussels which the with Brussels has a global city.

00:20:05
Nick Schuetman takes you to enter to deal with issues of social and ethnic segregation.

00:20:07
Mind that this is a bike trip.

00:20:14
So maybe some of you are less comfortable with biking, just taking to account.

00:20:18
Others may be extremely experienced and fight the rates to slow and also don't want to join.

00:20:31
then there's an excursion to Shellrva again by Nick and then Voitek will take you on an excursion in Brussels around the team of everyday mobility.

00:20:36
So for excursions you have to choose to.

00:20:44
This is also something that I mentioned in this Google Sheets or Spectsheets.

00:20:51
try to go for one Brussels excursion and one other excursion because you want to kind of

00:20:57
give everybody opportunity to go beyond Brussels otherwise your remains stuck in the Brussels bubble.

00:21:04
So there's please select either and to a I would say or either shall it run. Yes.

00:21:12
The answer by trade is actually right how about the Wilfern-Rössen pointer? No. No.

00:21:15
Okay, thank you, I'm gonna go by train.

00:21:19
And then I don't think it's even the entire day,

00:21:22
but at some point I'll go to the luck ball,

00:21:26
which is kind of a social housing product project

00:21:30
from I think the 60s, if I'm not mistaken,

00:21:33
and to reach that, you'll go by bike.

00:21:38
Yeah, some people feel less comfortable doing that.

00:21:43
You could also say we have one month to get trained.

00:21:47
And in the case, it could be an opportunity.

00:21:49
But take this into account.

00:21:50
Yes.

00:21:50
What was the question?

00:21:54
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:56
No, no, no, no.

00:21:57
Yeah.

00:21:58
Well, there's a bike rental.

00:21:59
Yeah.

00:22:01
Nick has arranged bikes.

00:22:02
Are there any other questions about this?

00:22:09
Not yet.

00:22:12
No, but typically, I mean, this would be communicated.

00:22:17
They started in the early morning and the end at the end of the day.

00:22:20
Yeah, but it's a full day.

00:22:21
Same.

00:22:24
OK.

00:22:30
So please go to this spreadsheet and project

00:22:47
preferences. All right. Okay, I hope this the skills it. So fill out your preferences as soon as

00:22:54
possible and no later than next week. Okay, so there's limited capacity for each of these

00:23:03
versions so please take care of it. All right a bit more about the course materials

00:23:13
as you will see on Kungvas there's a reader which what I call required readings so I expect

00:23:20
everybody reads this at least once and preferably in advance of an advance of each lecture

00:23:23
It's kind of way to keep track of the discussion.

00:23:26
And there will also be additional readings.

00:23:30
And these additional readings will kind of be the resource that we will use in the discussion

00:23:31
so please.

00:23:42
Yeah, the rest I've said already, session slides and recordings available for each session.

00:23:43
And then this is weird.

00:23:47
And then you have access via conference.

00:23:52
A bit more about evaluation and great distribution.

00:23:57
So this assignment in this question seminar

00:24:05
is a critical summary and it accounts for one fifth of your total grade.

00:24:12
So it's a kind of a way to be remunerated if you will for your efforts during the semester.

00:24:18
But the whole idea is that we digest our way through the literature and through the

00:24:23
reader, that we do this in a collective way.

00:24:25
So what is the assignment?

00:24:29
All students have to read the required readings.

00:24:37
But then I have no idea what to do actually.

00:24:44
Let me just check this is off.

00:25:06
Okay, let's just try to continue.

00:25:12
So per two, you'll be invited to critically summarize one additional reading, so it could be

00:25:19
a paper on Baywood, for instance, when we're talking about global cities.

00:25:24
And yeah, I'll announce a schedule for that.

00:25:27
You'll have a ten minutes of presentation.

00:25:34
And what you're asked to do is that you focus on a core quote or passage or excerpt from

00:25:39
the text that you kind of use this as an introduction to the text that you tell us all about

00:25:46
the main argument of the authors, that you connect this to the wider debate or the literature

00:25:50
that we've been discussing, yeah, we've been talking about women in local cities.

00:25:51
Yeah.

00:25:56
How do you connect this particular study that we're reading about?

00:26:01
And then toward the end, you want to give some kind of a critical reflection.

00:26:03
So you can also start with the critical reflection

00:26:06
and weave that through the entire presentation,

00:26:09
but you should end with a number of discussion questions

00:26:12
which we can then use to kickstart the debate.

00:26:17
So 10 minutes, you give kind of a crash or summary

00:26:20
of what the paper is about, why matters,

00:26:24
what we learn from it, and how we connect that

00:26:26
to the discussions that we're ready to have.

00:26:28
So that's the critical summary,

00:26:30
a bit more on that in a second.

00:26:33
We do have a presentation at home.

00:26:34
Yes.

00:26:35
OK.

00:26:39
Because otherwise it will be endless through a presentation.

00:26:42
It's something that you can do with too.

00:26:47
So yeah, it's both of you should take the floor at some point.

00:26:51
So there's a different balance exercise.

00:26:54
And also try to make this an integrated exercise,

00:26:57
not somebody, one person saying, OK,

00:27:14
Okay, this is the argument, but then the other person not knowing the argument, but having come up with the neural fresh. So to give a stupid example, that's not the idea. So to really try to discuss and text together and come to some kind of a shared understanding there and already debating this amongst the two of you.

00:27:18
We will really be something worked while I think.

00:27:24
Yeah, and then the largest part of the evaluation is a written exam.

00:27:31
And this is basically a way to test, you could say, your knowledge of urban,

00:27:36
of the urban theories and concepts that we've been discussing throughout the semester,

00:27:38
throughout different modules.

00:27:44
There's no particular focus on memorizing things by heart,

00:27:53
But it's about mobilizing your knowledge to study empirical examples cases, etc.

00:27:58
And I think we'll give examples of that throughout the course.

00:28:09
For instance, when you think about culture as an essay, say, urban development strategy,

00:28:14
We may get a question about this in you, santra, don't be due.

00:28:19
Santra can now be due next to the Brussels Canal Zone.

00:28:25
To what extent is this a case of cultural regeneration?

00:28:26
Discuss.

00:28:31
And then you would have to interpret the case on that base.

00:28:33
So it's not just about reproduction.

00:28:35
That's about applying what you've learned,

00:28:39
critically reflecting on the different concepts, etc.

00:28:47
And you'll use the readings, the slides, the recordings, personal notes from seminars and lectures.

00:28:59
And yeah, those who write on a disc of my excursion can also always refer to the filters to actually get a bit of more inspiration.

00:29:05
So that's the setup of the great distribution.

00:29:09
And yeah, a bit more still about this critical summary.

00:29:17
Just a number of questions that you could use as a source of inter-age inspiration or a template.

00:29:21
So what is the key message from the paper?

00:29:26
Why is it important? What is the key argument? What have you learned?

00:29:29
And really try to be as nuanced as possible.

00:29:37
Can you compare the argument being made with other perspectives or perspective from the required readings or anything

00:29:47
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:29:50
>> You have found important?

00:29:54
>> Yeah, this is going to be a real sound.

00:29:56
>> Yeah, I have no idea.

00:30:02
>> When I move, I have you pressure.

00:30:09
Okay, let's try to continue.

00:30:16
Yeah?

00:30:17
Yeah.

00:30:18
Okay.

00:30:23
I wonder what was happening.

00:30:26
I wonder what was happening.

00:30:29
We're seeing out in the background.

00:30:34
I think maybe, you know, it might sink in some of the stuff.

00:30:35
Okay.

00:30:40
You're everything that would be the case?

00:30:41
And the appearance.

00:30:43
Good everybody's supposed to have the phones.

00:30:45
It's definitely option.

00:30:49
It's like 100 phones being switched off. Is that possible to try?

00:30:55
Yeah, but I don't really find it. I think it's necessary.

00:31:03
But yeah, I think that's what I can do actually.

00:31:12
Maybe yeah, let's try. Okay, maybe you'll have to lift it or I can sort it out later.

00:31:26
later. What happens to break? Go this one.

00:31:55
[Music]

00:31:58
Let's see.

00:31:59
Excuse me.

00:32:02
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:04
And knowingly.

00:32:05
OK, I'm not a genius.

00:32:09
This is clear right now.

00:32:10
All right.

00:32:12
And then, yeah, final point that I already

00:32:16
said is try to think the debate.

00:32:19
That's what it's all about in the end.

00:32:20
OK?

00:32:22
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:24
No, you have to do this once.

00:32:31
Yeah, so what I'll do is as soon as I have the full overview is who are actually taking this course, make a schedule.

00:32:36
And then you'll have to present once with somebody else.

00:32:37
Yeah.

00:32:54
It's not on canvas. It's a different kind of Google sheets, but you can click the link in the slides that I just showed.

00:32:57
So, when you're a little bit different.

00:32:59
Yeah.

00:33:04
But that, those who don't have access to come

00:33:09
for us may be asked somebody who has to share this link

00:33:13
or just ask somebody to sign you up via this link.

00:33:15
OK.

00:33:17
Is that clear?

00:33:19
Was there a whole lot of administration

00:33:21
sorry for that?

00:33:24
But that's how it goes, I guess.

00:33:26
So I hope everything is clear. Yes, please.

00:33:37
Yeah, but I'll make the distribution.

00:33:41
Yeah, because otherwise if we do this bottom up, then

00:33:44
it will be very, very difficult.

00:33:49
So well, yeah, but all texts are interesting, I would say.

00:33:52
So that's the idea.

00:33:57
But it might take a while because I think for most enforceities

00:33:58
quite clear.

00:34:00
So that could go fast.

00:34:02
Maybe for geographers and staff, it

00:34:06
could last a little bit longer because sometimes it's unclear

00:34:07
who is actually in the course.

00:34:08
But for most enforceities, I think this

00:34:10
can go actually quite fast.

00:34:14
And then you can also plan a little bit working semester.

00:34:15
OK.

00:34:19
All right.

00:34:24
So let's turn to some content then.

00:34:26
And let's start a trip.

00:34:30
What we'll be discussing in earnest today

00:34:35
is basically what we'll do is we'll deconstruct the title

00:34:40
course and ask for questions.

00:34:43
What is the urban?

00:34:45
What is the city?

00:34:47
What is geography?

00:34:52
And what does it mean when I say I'm critical?

00:34:54
Arguably critical is not in the title,

00:34:56
but it could have been.

00:35:02
It may seem nonsensical, but I think asking these very

00:35:05
blue sky questions perhaps could get us

00:35:08
closer to what understanding what urban geography is about.

00:35:10
So you can also start already starting

00:35:13
a little bit about what we would mean

00:35:18
in the term the urban and the city.

00:35:22
And maybe as I take you to a number of exhibits,

00:35:25
you can draw some inspiration for that,

00:35:26
and you can make a list.

00:35:28
And then in a few minutes, you'll

00:35:31
be invited to write a very short, one-minute paper.

00:35:34
It doesn't have to be pros, where you collect

00:35:39
a little bit of ideas on what those two terms put me.

00:35:41
Let's get started a bit.

00:35:44
You probably, and one of the reasons,

00:35:46
why some of you have studies,

00:35:50
was selected the Muslim urban studies or four cities,

00:35:55
is because you have been seduced by a discourse

00:35:58
or a frame of relief in the urban age,

00:36:01
processes occur increasingly in cities,

00:36:03
therefore we need to understand cities

00:36:05
if we want to make sense of our futures,

00:36:07
or something like that.

00:36:10
And this would be some kind of a framework or repertoire

00:36:14
That's the world that the United Nations

00:36:18
sorry calls a framework of the urban age.

00:36:21
And it's a kind of frame that says,

00:36:24
well, we've long been a, you could say,

00:36:28
rural global population or rural species.

00:36:30
But at some point,

00:36:32
and someday in 2005,

00:36:36
we became an urban species and ever since,

00:36:39
basically rural population growth

00:36:41
will be urban growth.

00:36:44
So increasingly, we're undergoing

00:36:48
as a global society of growth, of urbanization,

00:36:52
where more and more people become urban.

00:36:55
So this kind of mantra of the urban age

00:36:58
has been around since about 2007,

00:37:02
so immediately after this historical urban transition.

00:37:06
And it has been repeated as a kind of a motivation

00:37:09
for increased attention to cities.

00:37:18
So, and there's something behind that obviously because there is indeed a transition to the urban and it's observable here in Berkeley.

00:37:30
Roughly in the 1950s, about 70% of the population global population lived in rural areas and only 30% in urban areas.

00:37:39
It was 50/50 apparently around 2005 and now it's reversed or it's going to be reversed by 2050.

00:37:44
Expectation is that 70% of the global population will live in cities.

00:37:53
So that's kind of the framework of the urban age that is very much projected by

00:37:58
by United Nations, by all kinds of world reports,

00:38:02
and that is kind of taken over by both critical

00:38:06
and more uncritical voices and debate.

00:38:11
McKinsey would also use this to argue for more consultancy

00:38:13
into urban governance.

00:38:19
But just as much like Davis, when it talks about cities

00:38:28
slums, it uses as a critical framework to make his work in court.

00:38:36
So what is behind this is an assumed process or an identifiable process of globalized urbanization.

00:38:44
So the process by which the urban condition, if you will, is becoming a global phenomenon.

00:38:49
urbanization used to be something that was not global at all.

00:38:59
And if you look at a few maps by Michael Pachoning, has a great handbook on cities.

00:39:06
You see that it was very much, say, a Western European or Northern American affair.

00:39:16
So UK was extremely urbanized, European continent, also quite and US as well.

00:39:21
Apparently, a lost color is also extremely urbanized.

00:39:27
The rest of the world was on the map, but not really on the map of urbanization.

00:39:29
It didn't occur there.

00:39:30
Bam.

00:39:37
forward to the 1950s you see that this process is spreading, especially you could say throughout

00:39:44
your being continents, throughout the Commonwealth, you see Australia and kind of popping up

00:39:56
also you could say more developed mentalists say in Latin America, USSR and to a very very limited extent

00:40:06
Africa and then especially the market. Not so much in Asia as you can see. We're moving forward

00:40:16
in 1990s. We see that this process is both extending geographically and intensified. So a lot of

00:40:23
countries or quite a few countries in Europe have now an urbanization rate, apparently between 80

00:40:30
and 100%, which is kind of the ratio between population that lives in cities on the total population.

00:40:36
So between 80 and 100% of people live in cities according to these definitions.

00:40:45
Again, note Australia, it's a tremendously organized continent, if you will.

00:40:50
Obviously this is a projection of the ratio on the entire territory.

00:40:55
Okay, so almost all Australians live in cities,

00:40:58
but that doesn't mean that the entirety of Australia is a city.

00:41:03
Maps could lie, some extent.

00:41:07
So we may be exaggerating some things when we think about

00:41:13
the use of natural resources or environmental impact.

00:41:15
That's something that we could think about.

00:41:21
What is also important is kind of a different kind of figure,

00:41:23
is that there's some kind of a decoupling

00:41:27
between processes of one of the better words,

00:41:30
economic growth or what some people call

00:41:35
more problematic development and urbanization.

00:41:38
When you go back to say the history of urbanization

00:41:43
in the 19th century, it was a process that was intimately

00:41:47
linked to industrialization, economic growth,

00:41:51
But also obviously as we know, uneven development within West

00:41:53
New York being cities.

00:41:57
There was a lot of economic development in the UK.

00:42:01
Cities like Manchester, because there was a group of the textile

00:42:04
industry that led to economic growth.

00:42:07
But it also led to huge urban inequalities.

00:42:09
But in any case, at the aggregate level,

00:42:12
you could say, at the level of the country,

00:42:16
or the city, there wasn't an economic improvement.

00:42:19
and that's connected to the growth of these cities.

00:42:23
What you find in, you could say, the last 20 years

00:42:25
and this has something to do with all kinds

00:42:29
of neoliberal policies that work at the global scale,

00:42:33
especially when you talk about Asia and Africa.

00:42:37
You could say the strategic adjustment plans

00:42:42
that have been rolled out there by organizations such as

00:42:44
the International Monetary Fund

00:42:47
and it's a sister of brother, the World Bank,

00:42:50
which has basically opened up the borders

00:42:53
of these countries before an investment

00:42:57
as this which kickstart growth, okay?

00:43:00
In reality, one could argue that this has produced

00:43:03
a dependent form of growth,

00:43:06
or it's an exploitative relation

00:43:11
between the global periphery and the global core, okay?

00:43:13
But at the same time has initiated

00:43:16
and this is kind of the argument by my Davis,

00:43:20
an implosion of the countryside, rural living

00:43:24
in these places became untenable

00:43:27
because a lot of, say, subsidized activities

00:43:30
or state controlled activities were rolled back,

00:43:32
for instance, in agriculture.

00:43:35
This led to huge deprivation on the countryside

00:43:39
and in varying degrees, a search to grow

00:43:43
for the better life and a lot of African neutrides.

00:43:48
So if we told that it could be a sign of economic development,

00:43:51
you could say in the 19th century, and even if we take up

00:43:56
with a pinch of salt, that's still not possible to say in when you talk

00:44:01
about urbanization rates, for instance, in Africa, or parts of Asia.

00:44:02
Okay.

00:44:08
Now, so, and if you look at the rates of urbanization,

00:44:15
We're talking about 7% to 8% in some sub-Saharan African countries, whereas if you look at

00:44:23
older industrial areas or urbanized areas, it's somewhere between 1% and 2% still growth.

00:44:30
So with doubling, I would say in 36 years, if it's 2%, but far far less.

00:44:37
So yes, globalized urbanization that also shows, and then you look at the

00:44:47
list of largest cities. It was very much Euro-American if you will. The industrial

00:44:57
hard-life, hard-lands, some exceptions Shanghai for instance, Japan, 1950s. But then it

00:45:07
It starts to really diversify and become actually a matter of not Euro-America, but Asia, Latin

00:45:14
America, and a number of leading cities in terms of population in the 1950s, and now well

00:45:17
down the list, take New York, for instance, others.

00:45:23
So this kind of thesis that urbanization is now a globalized phenomenon.

00:45:27
There are still different kinds of patterns behind that.

00:45:34
Just you can look into this at home because it may be a bit small to actually read here.

00:45:41
Some places when you look at Europe, we're talking about 80% urbanization.

00:45:47
Still in Africa despite its large urbanization rate,

00:45:51
still for most rural society.

00:45:57
So even despite the kind of a global transition toward globalized urbanization,

00:46:01
there's quite a bit of regional differences that we need to take into account.

00:46:04
And that brings me to the next slide.

00:46:09
This famous image that I stole it from Neil Brenner,

00:46:18
where Batman beats the crap out of Robin because he begins to talk about this urban age again.

00:46:26
I think it's a moment to really question critically what is meant by the urban ancient, to

00:46:31
what extent we should really believe and go along in this urban age frame.

00:46:35
And a very nice paper I haven't put it in the reader because there's already quite a

00:46:39
bit of things in there.

00:46:47
Is the paper by Neil Brenner and Christian Smith from 2014 and they really deconstruct this

00:46:55
narrative and they pointed to elements. One is the notion or the idea or the

00:46:59
observation that we're living in the urban age could be a statistical

00:47:06
artifact. So it's a matter of how we measure things and there's actually quite a

00:47:14
bit of divergence over time but also across countries as to how a city is

00:47:24
actually measured. In some contexts there's a city, something counts as a city as of 1 inhabitants.

00:47:33
In other countries it would be 10 and it would have a tremendous impact on how we calculate the urbanization.

00:47:43
So this is more fundamentally what an argument is that there's a huge nationalist bias in how the urban

00:47:44
is defined.

00:47:46
I'm not saying that there's 200 definitions,

00:47:53
but for instance, when you look at the work of organizations

00:47:56
like United Nations, they have been struggling

00:48:01
to set a standard definition of what the urban is.

00:48:03
There's still quite a bit of diversity.

00:48:06
And when you look at the work of urban geographers

00:48:10
for the past 50 or 60 years, this is a kind of recurring issue.

00:48:15
So what they say is that, yes, there are real empirical caps

00:48:20
knowledge here of the rate of urbanization.

00:48:24
And therefore, it's almost meaningless to say

00:48:29
in some day, in 2005, we became more urban,

00:48:31
I'll repine now our urban species.

00:48:34
So it's kind of, yes, there's a broad trajectory

00:48:40
toward urbanization, but there's a very large bandwidth

00:48:42
that we should consider.

00:48:48
And in fact, it could be more interesting to look at different kind of urbanization trajectories

00:48:54
because it's dealing with all kinds of different processes that need to be studied as

00:48:56
historically unfolding

00:49:00
rather just than being captured in a figure of

00:49:05
75% for it. So it's more of an invitation. It's not looking at it.

00:49:09
So there's also connects to the second argument is that

00:49:18
The urban, as it is being measured by a process of urbanization, is so much of a chaotic

00:49:19
abstraction.

00:49:27
It means that different kind of things that are not necessarily related are packed together

00:49:31
to define a certain process.

00:49:35
And this is something that, for instance, a new Brenner and Christmas month have also worked

00:49:42
on later as the discussion of planetary urbanization, I invite you to look into that debate.

00:49:49
Their argument is that the urban, in fact, as a condition, as a way of life, or as a system

00:49:56
of production or exploitation does not neatly overlay actual morphologies of cities.

00:50:06
So the urban may have nothing to do with a concentrated blob of people in space or with

00:50:09
sitting within a particular jurisdiction.

00:50:12
It could be connected to suburbs, et cetera.

00:50:19
So what they kind of are concerned with is when you talk about a race of urbanization,

00:50:26
is that you classify or categorize quite diverse ways of living into one category of

00:50:32
the urban and even more problematic.

00:50:35
So hence we don't really learn anything about it.

00:50:38
And what is even more problematic is that the rural is defined

00:50:43
as the non-urban and is nearby.

00:50:47
Yeah, not studied at all as kind of the left behind place,

00:50:50
that only exists in opposition to what really counts, which

00:50:53
is then the way forward, which is urban living.

00:51:01
So that's kind of their argument, just to kick start a little bit to your thinking on this,

00:51:07
since we now have, I would say, 60 seconds for a one-minute paper, okay?

00:51:08
So please think a little bit.

00:51:17
You can talk to your neighbor in any direction about what the urban is, what a city is,

00:51:20
and what the difference is between the two.

00:51:21
Right.

00:51:25
Your gone and gone.

00:51:28
(audience chattering)

00:51:57
[ Music ]

00:52:00

(crowd murmuring)

(crowd chatter)

00:52:42
[ Background Sounds ]

00:52:45
(people talking)

00:52:49
Now, those who are wandering in great space!

00:52:52
(crowd chatter)

00:53:15
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:19
Almost three minutes for a little bit of paper.

00:53:27
What is a city? What's the urban? What's the difference?

00:53:32
Yeah.

00:53:38
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:40
Now what's the problem of that?

00:53:43
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:45
Okay, so what's the difference then?

00:53:49
Why do you say, why is the urban in a place?

00:53:55
Or maybe not. Or rather, it would be a high density of the money to the player and CT.

00:53:58
Your assessor just put him across it.

00:54:01
Okay. And why do you think it's the reverse?

00:54:07
I think element of the oven can exist everywhere. I don't think element of the technique is everyone.

00:54:14
So the city defined as a dense place is kind of identifiable in space, rather urban goods.

00:54:26
Yeah, connected everywhere potentially. Okay, other ideas? Yeah?

00:54:40
I would say that urban and public knowledge along the federal world of the city is something like you should see in this high-quality economy that are live in a field of mind and it's a company that has been charged with something more to be closed for me.

00:54:46
So one is about, you could say, concrete, lumped material.

00:54:52
In other words, it's about device by a little bit of special, or interaction.

00:54:55
Well, mouth-driven societies, yeah.

00:54:56
Are you going to use?

00:54:57
Do you have any ideas?

00:54:58
Yeah?

00:55:03
I would call the government as much as the accident and it's getting a big threat to the police.

00:55:05
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:08
I think that connects a little bit to what we say, processes,

00:55:12
and then maybe outcomes for the organization.

00:55:14
Now, otherwise it is.

00:55:17
Yeah.

00:55:22
There are a big meaning, a movement towards the collective good.

00:55:26
So, a collective use, let me put it like that.

00:55:29
The notions of transportation to get

00:55:32
amongst a number of people from one place to the other,

00:55:34
communication etc.

00:55:38
And now we will be captured by the notion of the city.

00:55:47
If need not, the east can be in places of extreme excuse and a date of dedicated to work

00:55:49
and its business and caste.

00:55:57
So a lot of not all cities have the notions of having public transport that is important for

00:55:58
everyone.

00:56:02
But I would say that if you are talking about the government, you know already thinking of

00:56:09
in terms of how do we organize this mass group of people and how do we get order into

00:56:17
so how about the particular project particular values perhaps behind policies to organize cities

00:56:24
yeah building on the process idea that would mention okay okay and the other ideas still

00:56:32
I think it's very interesting to me. I think of it having things, circle, look at the like

00:56:39
economic relationships between people and maybe that was the mapping on to sort of like a

00:56:47
governance structure. For urban and maybe think more about what is the like level of density

00:56:51
and the living situation of people.

00:56:52
Okay.

00:56:53
Mm-hmm.

00:56:55
Kind of more, like a descriptor versus like,

00:57:00
thing that everybody is like,

00:57:02
waiting to your work for just anyone.

00:57:04
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57:07
There was a hand so your eyes somewhere, yeah, at the back.

00:57:11
Yeah, I'm just gonna sit behind the other thing.

00:57:13
They have a boundary and they're kind of like

00:57:16
of the public's common control committee.

00:57:18
The question of the next question

00:57:20
is that you have some combination of that

00:57:21
to you,

00:57:25
and you're very familiar with the committee.

00:57:29
Yeah, so it's a administrative unit

00:57:32
with elected officials, et cetera,

00:57:34
that's a counts within the boundaries

00:57:36
of a certain space and I'll be on that.

00:57:40
All right, so inductively,

00:57:43
you might make my next slide completely redundant.

00:57:48
So yeah, one of the ideas and important say,

00:57:52
I mean with revolutionary, it's kind of a sensitivity

00:57:56
that the urban and citizens are not necessarily the same.

00:58:00
I think the point is not to say or to define clearly

00:58:03
what a city is or the urban is,

00:58:06
but to offer different kind of perspectives,

00:58:11
different kind of lenses on the question.

00:58:14
and by offering different kind of perspectives

00:58:18
or emerging from different kind of questions,

00:58:21
we may actually learn more about the process of urbanization.

00:58:25
So there's not kind of one ruling explanation,

00:58:27
but there's many ways of looking at it.

00:58:32
But I think, yeah, we'll get to something more.

00:58:37
So one idea is that it's about a concentration,

00:58:41
people, it's also about the concentration of stuff.

00:58:44
lump of material, the built environment.

00:58:46
Yeah, so it's something with density,

00:58:50
something else, so a lot of I think urbanists would recognize,

00:58:53
so it's the built environment, built up space

00:58:58
that really gives morphological signs that at some point

00:59:00
we have arrived in the city.

00:59:05
We at high rises be a lot of congestion

00:59:09
that would be markers of characteristics of folks.

00:59:12
So that's kind of not necessarily urban,

00:59:16
but kind of a marker of what is acid.

00:59:21
Then, stretching a little bit more into,

00:59:24
you can say the overlays between what is urban

00:59:28
and how it's deep borders, cities.

00:59:33
Cities are sometimes defined as the opposite

00:59:36
of the non-city, as I was saying,

00:59:37
as the opposite of the rural.

00:59:39
And then a number of planning context,

00:59:43
I'm thinking about, for instance, the Netherlands.

00:59:46
It will actually be, if you look at the satellite image,

00:59:50
it will be identifiable where one urban area ends

00:59:53
and there's country side and then something else starts.

00:59:58
But yeah, in many contexts,

01:00:00
especially in the lavish one, for instance,

01:00:03
this is a reality where you won't get really far.

01:00:07
It's kind of, you're not sure where the city ends.

01:00:12
You end up with some kind of large boulevars

01:00:17
that connect to villages in the middle of nowhere.

01:00:21
There's a lot of built up stuff along these shops,

01:00:22
etc.

01:00:26
And there's a lot of activities actually taking place

01:00:30
outside of the core areas of urban agglomerations.

01:00:34
the suburbs, there's actually intensification

01:00:35
of activities and suburbs.

01:00:42
So yeah, what does it still mean to talk about the city

01:00:45
as being opposed to the non-city, the rural,

01:00:49
it generates all kinds of fuzzy categories.

01:00:51
So purely morphologically,

01:00:55
millions end up being a child.

01:00:56
Yes.

01:01:21
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:26
We haven't covered this yet, so maybe we're talking about this.

01:01:34
So it's, yeah, the urban or a city is the place of an urban life, but perhaps the urban

01:01:37
also stretches beyond the city itself.

01:01:42
So urban living could also be taking place in the suburbs.

01:01:50
But it's some kind of an idea that within the spaces, a different kind of society and

01:01:56
in a different kind of behavior, norms, values, and take place.

01:02:03
So it's a distinctive way of life, but still it could be a very different kind of energy

01:02:11
that we may be talking about or a different kind of bonds that actually ties people together.

01:02:14
So just compare slum living with loft living.

01:02:22
It's a very distinct way of urban living, but they both be characterized as something else

01:02:24
than rural living.

01:02:30
So and there's this big debate, I would say, in urban sociology, between what is now

01:02:36
distinct about the urban way of life at a some kind of an assumption that you move from

01:02:39
community to society.

01:02:45
communities think about rural communities where you have all kinds of personal relations

01:02:49
with neighbors, small villages.

01:02:55
And this gets formalized and nullomized as soon as you get to cities because distances become

01:03:00
larger because there's all kinds of institutional roles.

01:03:04
There's a division of labor that we'll get to in a second.

01:03:06
And it becomes more abstract.

01:03:12
take a certain function within society which is less mediated by social relations. That was kind

01:03:19
of the argument by a lot of sociologists also in the 19th century that try to capture the process

01:03:25
of urbanization. So it's a distinctive way of life. It's not just buildings and homes of material.

01:03:33
It's more than that. Another way of looking at it and with Hintonad, by you here at Front,

01:03:38
It's also about economic relations that tie together people.

01:03:44
I think about flows of energy, flows of work, flows of ideas,

01:03:50
flows of data that connects the inhabitants of a certain place.

01:03:56
And it would be more agglomerated in some places than others,

01:03:59
but they wouldn't be necessarily confined to,

01:04:02
you could say, the core of metropolitan areas.

01:04:31
So the city is also the place where divisions of labour emerge and there's this famous picture by Adam Smith's needle factory or pin factory, where cities are kind of a microcosm of a workshop where different kind of tasks that used to be integrated in thin making are kind of cut up and collectively places produce a certain economic problem.

01:04:41
So this inputs needed by different suppliers, different kind of specialized workers to end up with a product.

01:04:51
So historically that has been a way where open elites could emerge that could also kind of manage this process,

01:04:58
that could also absorb part of the surplus that was being generated by a more efficient

01:05:04
division of labor, standardization of work, for instance, and was also, you can say,

01:05:12
a more critical framework of the place where uneven development and urban inequalities actually have their origins.

01:05:19
So it produced more efficiency, it increased the urban surplus, if you will, but not everybody benefited.

01:05:24
So a complex division of labor, the idea that there are

01:05:29
agglomeration effects by being in a certain place,

01:05:33
economic agents for instance, will benefit from their presence

01:05:35
because they have specialized inputs.

01:05:41
That's kind of the realm of economic geographies that try to capture

01:05:43
that process.

01:05:47
And now obviously when you talk about divisions of labor,

01:05:50
about these energies that go around,

01:05:54
these also structure urban spaces

01:05:56
and you could say urban class relations

01:05:58
in a particular way.

01:06:03
So you could apply some kind of regulations perspective here

01:06:05
thinking about,

01:06:11
we could say different eras of cities

01:06:16
as being engaged in particular production processes,

01:06:23
recapitalist cities, for instance, the top left, then the typical newly industrializing

01:06:29
cities top right, then going bottom left to 40 cities.

01:06:35
And then you could say contemporary cities that are kind of both exploded and imploded

01:06:38
at the same time with rising densities at the edges.

01:06:44
And also a re-entensification of built up areas in the very core and return of activities

01:06:45
there.

01:06:50
a regular regulation perspective is also what Dorian Massey

01:06:51
would be talking about.

01:06:55
She was a famous economic geographer,

01:06:57
economic geographer from 1980s.

01:07:00
She was also one of the main critical voices

01:07:04
and trying to understand how particular forms of capitalism

01:07:08
leave their imprint on society in general

01:07:10
and on urban societies in particular.

01:07:12
She was interested in regions, but it also

01:07:15
can be applied to cities.

01:07:19
So yeah, you had a really very high rock

01:07:21
go to society in general.

01:07:23
I mean, there's a huge generalization here

01:07:26
in medieval cities where the core wasn't

01:07:29
elite realm with some domestic servants.

01:07:32
Then there was a kind of a layer of the lower classes,

01:07:34
and then basically the outcomes with a number

01:07:35
of ethnic communities.

01:07:40
This is a huge generalization, but it's kind of a guiding

01:07:44
model that is it's set to hold.

01:07:46
When you think about industrializing cities,

01:07:50
it was kind of thing and this is Chicago for sure.

01:07:55
I will be talking a bit more about Chicago as it became a model

01:07:58
of the industrial city in the early 20th century.

01:08:02
A lot of industrial activity in the commercial

01:08:07
part of the city and then radiating out

01:08:09
in terms of, you could say, class,

01:08:13
his working man's houses and then further on,

01:08:16
more elite cities, people, neighborhoods, people

01:08:19
that could actually afford to commute to the city set.

01:08:24
Then after the second world tour,

01:08:25
actually, like at the bottom left,

01:08:28
it's kind of a gorgeous city where capitalism was

01:08:31
regulated in a particular way,

01:08:34
where the surplus that was being created

01:08:37
by capitalist production, think about all these factories

01:08:41
Mass production was being shared by the working class.

01:08:44
So this is kind of a typical American dream.

01:08:45
It can provide the American cities,

01:08:48
but friends also can provide European cities

01:08:52
where we had a massive round of serverization,

01:08:56
the good life where you could live far removed

01:09:00
from where you were, commute by car,

01:09:04
and it was a way to kind of spatially redistribute

01:09:07
the surface that was being generated in cities.

01:09:12
And that's a kind of a Harvey and David Harvey interpretation

01:09:13
of suburbanization.

01:09:15
It's not just a lifestyle.

01:09:18
It's also a spatial form of how capitalism

01:09:22
of in that period worked.

01:09:26
And then kind of finally, this kind of growth

01:09:28
at the periphery.

01:09:30
We see a kind of an outward movement,

01:09:33
you can see the urbanization of suburbanism.

01:09:36
All kinds of knowledge and densities

01:09:39
and then starting to take place at the edges,

01:09:44
all of city centers that are losing functions,

01:09:46
this kind of historical process in the 70s and 80s,

01:09:49
lot of derelict areas, ground food areas,

01:09:52
which are then in subsequent decades,

01:09:55
increasingly becoming the places where you have waves

01:10:00
of gentrification, a return of capital to city centers,

01:10:01
et cetera, et cetera.

01:10:06
And admit all this, and I'm trying to hugely summarize

01:10:08
and generalized here, because it's

01:10:13
a kind of ideal typical approach, diversity that

01:10:15
is increasing in a lot of cities,

01:10:20
new pockets of exclusiveness and exclusion

01:10:21
on the other hand.

01:10:25
So cities also becoming increasingly polarized.

01:10:29
So the urban is different depending

01:10:32
on the period you're talking about.

01:10:35
It could be characterized differently,

01:10:42
depending on where you are and in what period you're talking about.

01:10:53
Bottom left and right? Yeah, you could say that. I mean, in some handbooks it would be called

01:10:59
the Fortis City, this one. And this would be the post-40 city, which is exactly the

01:11:05
This is not one identifiable core in the metropolitan area.

01:11:11
Whereas this was still very much in relation to the core, but it captures different.

01:11:13
You could call it modernity.

01:11:22
Yes, but that would more refer to, you could say, a discussion of planning approaches,

01:11:28
modernist planning for instance, where it was okay, we're going to organize the city in zones.

01:11:35
zones, here is residential function, here we have industrial function. But you're right,

01:11:43
and that's in the 40s city. It was at a larger scale managed like that. There was also

01:11:53
where a lot of urbanist counter-reaction was launched against later on. Think about figure of

01:11:59
Jane Jacobs, who basically said, well, with modernist planning this hand, there's a top-down

01:12:05
approach. It doesn't have anything to do with urban life in an obvious own. So we have to take

01:12:10
stock of that, just thinking about a different way of planning. So modernism would be a marker,

01:12:16
I would say, of, again, yeah, of urban society, but also about planning traditions that have

01:12:25
produced before the city. And then another way and this was really mentioned is

01:12:34
yeah the urban or the city is also kind of a projector of symbol at power. It sends a message

01:12:42
to the world and this is becoming I mean goes back to the 12th and the 13th century where

01:12:50
the legal cities and flowers had the highest, wanted to have the highest building or some

01:12:57
zoom in the other in the 14th century and northern Italy had something to do with corporate power,

01:13:04
the merchant power, and also showing the liberties of cities vis-a-vis territorial states,

01:13:10
which were then still feudal states and the Middle Ages. You see that this is becoming much more

01:13:16
globalized and that's the content of these messages is also very diverse. You have the CCTV

01:13:23
building on Beijing, which is some kind of a representation of, you can say, the authoritarian power

01:13:32
of the Chinese central state over China, but also, et cetera, totally, there's the World Trade Center.

01:13:37
Yeah, I don't think we need to deconstruct that.

01:13:42
And in there's a lot of images, I mean about a claim

01:13:47
imperialism by the US, which was vested in the commercial

01:13:52
interests or the commercial power of the US,

01:13:58
which then also became a symbol of oppression, if you will,

01:14:04
and made it a target for attacks as we all know.

01:14:12
So it's a highly contested or arbitrary symbol there.

01:14:17
And often it's also kind of used in spectacular developments,

01:14:23
you could say, Putska Lifa in the Middle East and Dubai.

01:14:28
It's kind of a part of a wider process of, say,

01:14:34
supply side economics where it's really about building capacity, building state-of-the-art

01:14:39
infrastructure, with the idea that it built a strong business, another bill in the end,

01:14:49
drive growth. Dubai, an emerald without oil, oil has run out since the 60s, has had this

01:14:55
diversification strategy, and it has been to some extent a kind of self-fitting prophecy.

01:15:02
So yeah, it's kind of a token of importance of centrality that has been proclaimed there.

01:15:10
It also is a token of all the things, a huge exploitation of temporary labor, for instance,

01:15:15
but that is typically the dark side of these kind of buildings that is less discussed.

01:15:22
So, far the spectacular urbanism makes us wonder what is behind this image.

01:15:29
So yeah, symbolic power is also kind of projected by certain kind of cities.

01:15:36
And then maybe a final definition is in the atmosphere definition.

01:15:43
It has a certain jurisdiction within a country.

01:15:49
It's the way where all kinds of management processes are administered for the population,

01:15:53
a service, but it had a public sector organized itself.

01:15:59
What is kind of interesting is that there's a lot of historical

01:16:05
and yeah, aberrations almost when you take, for instance, the example

01:16:11
of Miesen and West Flanders. I put an arrow there, but there's a

01:16:15
Belgian that well. It has about 1 population,

01:16:18
In 2019, but it counts as a city.

01:16:21
So it's kind of a historical artifact.

01:16:28
It used to be a very important trading center for broad cloth,

01:16:36
if you've ever been to Grüch, that was kind of the main kind of produce that was kind of traded there.

01:16:39
Grüch is what's 40 a day at that time.

01:16:44
So a fifth of the size of world city, Grüch is, I think the 13th century.

01:16:50
So what is a very small community now was there and then an important city and somehow

01:16:58
missing has kept city rights and would still count as a city in UN language.

01:17:06
Okay, so just to show that we should probably be very very about these classifications because

01:17:10
they can be quite misleading.

01:17:11
Okay.

01:17:11
Thank you.

01:17:12
Yeah.

01:17:13
One thing that's not like trying to get it out

01:17:16
for the clinical care of the

01:17:18
and the other, it's only the amount of the number

01:17:20
of people living there or.

01:17:22
That's a good question.

01:17:23
I don't know it by heart,

01:17:27
but there would be a combination of many things

01:17:30
that would be indeed size of the population.

01:17:35
I think we have more morphological characteristics.

01:17:42
typically it would be continuous built up areas.

01:17:47
And then included in that,

01:17:51
some definition of a percentage of people commuting

01:17:53
to the poor city.

01:17:57
So areas that are still dependent on the poor city

01:17:59
because they're part of an integrated labor market.

01:18:02
So I don't know it by heart,

01:18:04
but there's kind of the agglomeration

01:18:08
and then the bond here, which just gives a kind of an arbitrary

01:18:10
of that.

01:18:15
And that's basically what they call functional urban areas.

01:18:18
That's the kind of definition that is

01:18:20
practical, which gives you.

01:18:23
The thing that you can also say is that you have to

01:18:24
point--

01:18:26
because I know what they need to tell what my

01:18:28
friend is that there is a decision in

01:18:29
everybody else who writes.

01:18:32
So maybe they just never requested

01:18:34
Anyway, it didn't.

01:18:35
It did.

01:18:35
It did.

01:18:37
Well, back in the H.F.

01:18:38
Yeah.

01:18:39
Yeah.

01:18:40
I think that that couldn't be--

01:18:42
I don't know the ins and outs of that.

01:18:46
But I think in Utah it could be part of the process as well.

01:18:47
Yeah.

01:18:49
[INAUDIBLE]

01:18:52
We just look at our information.

01:18:54
[INAUDIBLE]

01:18:55
Yeah.

01:18:57
They tried to come up with some kind of standardization

01:18:59
on the criteria that I was mentioning.

01:19:05
So how many people live there, more logical continuity,

01:19:08
and then you could say economic relations.

01:19:11
But especially with the population threshold,

01:19:14
there's a huge dedication.

01:19:18
Some countries would be 1, and others would be 10.

01:19:22
It would be very good.

01:19:26
I think they do because Belgium does.

01:19:28
So that's kind of the irony.

01:19:33
And that gets lost in when you look at the urbanization rates of 200 plus countries,

01:19:40
you count the candidate. But the point by by Brennan instrument is that even if you solve that

01:19:45
and come to a standardized definition, you're still not out of the woods because it could still

01:19:52
create all kinds of chaotic conceptions because the burden is not the same as the city.

01:19:56
Okay, so that was kind of what's the point, okay.

01:19:59
So I hope, yeah, there's a number of perspectives here.

01:20:05
There's not one size fits all answer to what you heard

01:20:08
in the city is, but there's different ways

01:20:11
of approaching the theme, okay.

01:20:18
Now, one definition that we could still use,

01:20:22
And this is also one that is used in the hamburger

01:20:25
because it's kind of very generically at the abstract level.

01:20:28
It's obviously urbanization is the process

01:20:30
of becoming urban.

01:20:32
And it refers at the abstract level

01:20:36
to demographic process where it increasingly people live

01:20:39
in more and more density.

01:20:41
Has something to do with a globalization

01:20:46
of urban influence,

01:20:52
be an economic, political, cultural, it's kind of these places that matter.

01:20:58
And obviously this frame of the urban age is mobilized there.

01:21:08
And it's a call for starting to look into how cities are connected to the wider process of urban development.

01:21:13
And this is also connecting back to this notion of planetary urbanization by

01:21:22
and the sense what they argue is that while cities may not populate the entire hurt,

01:21:32
they're actually quite delineated still. If you produce a map, you can't say that the entire global map is urban.

01:21:40
Maybe a lot of people live in cities, but still it wouldn't be a totality. Whereas the urban,

01:21:49
as a process, as a way of living, as a system of capitalist production, would be almost a totality.

01:22:00
And in planetary urbanization, characters actually de facto even when you go as far as possible from the urban context, from cities.

01:22:04
It would still lead back to these cities one way or another.

01:22:08
So the exploitation of sea beds in the North Atlantic,

01:22:11
it's absolutely not--

01:22:13
has not the characteristics of cities,

01:22:19
but it's part of an exploitation process

01:22:22
that are commanded through cities.

01:22:27
So it's an example of what they call extensive urbanization,

01:22:30
whereas intensive urbanization in their mind

01:22:32
would be the morphology of cities.

01:22:40
So it's a kind of sociological imaginary of urbanization as it all leads back to cities

01:22:46
and one way or another. Whereas a more geographical imagination would start with, well, we can still

01:22:53
illuminate certain places as being more dense, being more common than one another, whereas we also

01:22:59
have to see the connections with other things. So that's just one more approach of looking at it.

01:23:05
We've been talking a little bit about urbanism because it's always a bit of confusion,

01:23:09
difference between urbanization, which we've been talking about, and urbanism.

01:23:16
We have urbanists here. It's not just about observing an analyzing process,

01:23:24
also designing cities and shaping cities in a particular way. So, urbanism is

01:23:34
the Métis is the craft of actually designing cities to a certain end.

01:23:39
But it also connects to, and that's perhaps also what you were talking about at some point,

01:23:45
gaining an urban attitude as something of an energy of that particular society in cities.

01:23:53
It refers to a particular psychological or sociological feeling that gives a particular meaning

01:23:59
to the space. And I already talked about the opposition between the ideal type of a community

01:24:06
where there's kind of warm social ties kicking things together versus society where it's more

01:24:14
abstract, warmer roles that are in personal. I think when you look at cities and the representations

01:24:20
and the way the urban space is consumed, you find a lot of that, you could say societal

01:24:30
anonymity or that kind of detached element in those images. And when you look at,

01:24:35
yeah, especially in the 19th century, I mean, when people started to capture

01:24:41
personal modernity, urban modernity, and it was this idea of the figure of the floner,

01:24:48
which was at the same time, it was usually the handy, a rich person that was both connected to

01:24:53
cities because of his wealth and he had to show himself of it at the same time. It was also a

01:25:00
spectator, a walker by Passon who consumed urban space from an enormous and detached way.

01:25:06
And especially in the 19th century, we have this gallery here close to the Grand Plus

01:25:13
in Brussels, it was a kind of urban space was designed for this anonymous consumption,

01:25:19
was all about collective spectacular consumption. And in many ways urban design,

01:25:28
especially when we started rebrand our city centres, goes back to these forms of urban consumption.

01:25:36
If you think about these renderings of a unspark bouffard, or if you look at renderings of how

01:25:40
It will look like in 10 years.

01:25:44
It has this kind of spectacular element always to it.

01:25:53
That's that project, a particular kind of urban attitude that is there to consume urban space.

01:26:01
So urban design, it's about, you're really giving shape to urban spaces,

01:26:06
also capturing how people interact with psychologically

01:26:08
and social education, with the built environment,

01:26:10
especially with urbanism,

01:26:14
poor-ferences, environmental psychology,

01:26:17
and that is a very important team.

01:26:24
Planning is a future oriented activity,

01:26:26
which actors are very types engaged

01:26:29
so that they can govern how development will take place.

01:26:35
So obviously, economic process, society process,

01:26:38
don't just unfold in and of themselves.

01:26:41
It's a kind of process that being mediated

01:26:43
by particular planning cultures,

01:26:46
being we talked about zoning before.

01:26:50
It's about giving a place to certain activities,

01:26:53
making choices of where things should be developed.

01:26:57
And it's actually quite a power-laden process

01:26:58
because development in one place

01:27:01
could mean non-development in another place.

01:27:04
Where do jobs, where are jobs being created?

01:27:06
Where do they not?

01:27:08
And how do certain planning procedures

01:27:13
try to tackle a process of uneven development

01:27:15
or under development in the city?

01:27:19
And especially in a city like Brussels, one of the main,

01:27:23
you could say, folk of urban planning

01:27:26
in the regional plan has been the canal.

01:27:33
was kind of a prioritization space which needed to be redeveloped in one way.

01:27:41
It will be looking into the social geography of this place and throughout the course with

01:27:46
also as we go on excursions. It's an ethnically diverse, the lower income

01:27:52
neighbourhood with a lot of unemployment and it's also very much a zone of transition.

01:27:54
There's a lot of things happening there.

01:27:57
Redevelopment and planning is not neutral there.

01:28:00
There has been a large focus on this area,

01:28:05
both in terms of trying to achieve industrial redevelopment,

01:28:08
because there was a lot of unemployment

01:28:12
kind of a rollout of the zone of economic expansion

01:28:13
that was installed there.

01:28:18
That at the same time also the ambition to achieve

01:28:25
to increase the mixing of residential and working.

01:28:41
And what is kind of interesting there in Brussels is that there was a very big contradiction between the ambition to attract businesses to this area and create jobs and the ambition of

01:28:47
of mixity because mixity worked as a kind of an incentive for all of residential developers

01:28:59
to start building high end or regionally unaffordable apartments, house, etc.

01:29:08
So the idea of let's mix stuff is actually making the return of jobs to this area

01:29:12
very difficult at least to forms of industrial gentrification.

01:29:20
And it's also leading to some kind of affordability crisis because the types of houses that are

01:29:26
being produced there has nothing to do with what the local residents would actually need.

01:29:32
Okay, so there's housing production but it's not tailored to the to the demand if you will.

01:29:41
So yes, planning plays a role and it's all but a neutral process.

01:29:45
Now, what is geography?

01:29:53
You have one minute to discuss this and geographers, I am looking at you to explain what geography is

01:29:59
because I popped, please discuss what is geography?

01:30:25
[ Background Sounds ]

01:30:28
(audience chattering)

01:30:31
(people chattering)

01:30:59
[ Background Sounds ]

01:31:06
[ Inaudible ]

01:31:11
It's not an S I have to explain not the part of our branch of geology

01:31:14
as the sections as the difficulty will I need now.

01:31:17
Okay, but what's your idea about this?

01:31:28
[ Inaudible ]

01:31:36
And we are leaving the topology of the journey in

01:31:39
like that, looking at that from the left.

01:31:40
Mm-hmm.

01:31:44
That's where a particular location.

01:31:46
OK, so it's about location.

01:31:52
It's about the impact of, you can say, the terrain on activities and those kind of things.

01:31:53
OK.

01:31:54
Thank you.

01:32:16
[ Inaudible ]

01:32:20
I'm saying to repeat the study of space, I can be in contact with anything.

01:32:23
If not, it's not a way to study anything, it's not a case.

01:32:24
Yeah, go.

01:32:25
Does not work.

01:32:26
Yeah.

01:32:27
Okay.

01:32:31
That gives us tremendous power and job of course.

01:32:33
Thank you for that.

01:32:35
Thank you for that.

01:32:37
Any other ideas?

01:32:38
Yeah.

01:32:54
So, dialectics between humans and the environment, okay?

01:32:56
Other ideas?

01:32:57
Yeah?

01:33:07
[ Inaudible ]

01:33:13
[ Inaudible ]

01:33:14
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:33:15
Absolutely. Yeah.

01:33:17
I would say that's human geography.

01:33:18
Yeah.

01:33:19
Okay.

01:33:20
>> Everyone in this?

01:33:21
>> Yeah.

01:33:24
>> I would say that's a lot of the which we will space.

01:33:32
But not for geometrical, you know, the idea is that we can't explain what the problem comes in.

01:33:34
But that's what we're talking about.

01:33:38
So it's just a approach.

01:33:40
It's very interesting, yeah?

01:33:44
And you're right there, still?

01:33:49
Okay, I think, I think this is all, I would say, correct in a way,

01:33:52
but it shows that there's different, different answers to this question.

01:33:57
And the answer to this question has been different throughout the history of geography.

01:34:06
I would say in the 19th century it was indeed about creating detailed information on these sources to geography

01:34:13
and those kind of things because geography was installed in an imperial program of exploiting the colonies.

01:34:21
But throughout the decades the main purpose or as a result of geography has shifted.

01:34:28
Or there's different kind of parallel interpretations of what the purpose of geography should be.

01:34:33
I started a number of definitions where else do we go?

01:34:39
The real, real geographical society, this is kind of the heart of empire, if you will.

01:34:45
One of the first geographical societies, it's kind of part of the British empire,

01:34:52
as it's a kind of root disease and it gives us some idea of what geography could be.

01:34:57
So it's the understanding of social and physical processes within the context.

01:35:03
Place recognizing the great differences in culture, political system, economies, landscapes and environments

01:35:04
because the world and exploring things between.

01:35:12
So it's about the world as a mosaic, it's about geographical difference, sensitivity to contexts.

01:35:21
And also thinking relationally, so how does something that happens in Brussels connects to

01:35:23
quincias operands?

01:35:25
So it's about connections between places.

01:35:30
So these are not, I mean, I'm not saying these are ideal definitions.

01:35:35
By far not, but we can be inspired and take certain things from.

01:35:40
American association of geographers used to be the association of American members by the way,

01:35:47
that they changed their name to reflect more diverse audience in the community.

01:35:52
You want to understand the world, I'm not start with the river, city, mountain and

01:35:55
village erode and follow it to the ends of the earth.

01:36:02
Chography asks the big questions, where, how, why, what if, as you were saying, and gives

01:36:06
you the perspective to answer them with advanced technology and the solid knowledge of

01:36:09
the world in which we all live.

01:36:12
So follow your nose, trace connections,

01:36:15
and indeed ask these big questions.

01:36:22
Perhaps in other disciplines, there's less space to do so.

01:36:25
By the way, if you go to the original,

01:36:27
you could say literal Greek transcription

01:36:31
is heard description.

01:36:34
But that doesn't tell you that much, right?

01:36:40
standard definition would be to describe human activity at the interface of

01:36:47
with the Earth or something like that. So somehow goes back to a very

01:36:53
descriptive idea of what geography should be not necessarily producing any

01:37:00
analytical knowledge or explanatory knowledge. So I tend to not to like that

01:37:08
definition too much but in original Greek it's what I mean. Now to further a little

01:37:13
bit there and I think I mean this is going a little bit more towards my own

01:37:19
interpretation as well just another quote. Take from the handbook while most

01:37:23
social science disciplines can be roughly defined by what they study the

01:37:27
economy culture society and so on. Geography is defined by how is that so that

01:37:32
was you were saying and then so the world by our approach. Geographers studied the

01:37:38
economy's set of politics and culture too but a geographical perspective is one that emphasizes

01:37:46
space and is supposed to any of these things. So it's not just that we can claim like political

01:37:53
scientists or like economists this kind of thematic field. It's really our you could say theoretical

01:37:58
and analytical working with the notion of space,

01:38:03
space as something that explains what human activity

01:38:10
as it interacts with its environment that really identifies.

01:38:13
So sets us apart asographers from us.

01:38:14
Yeah.

01:38:15
Just to question the power system,

01:38:17
the condition and any difference from,

01:38:21
no, as you jump sociology as well.

01:38:26
because there would be far less attention to space, I would say.

01:38:32
So, Charles, the only isn't that space is also the final of human interactions.

01:38:36
Like, the old one is showing.

01:38:40
How space defines, how I wouldn't think so.

01:38:46
I think sociologists would start with a particular history,

01:38:54
histories perhaps, look at the relations, organizational forms, perhaps identity, those kind of processes

01:39:02
that I think, and they perhaps they may describe the variety across different contexts in one way

01:39:10
or another, but perhaps they would not use geography to explain those differences. So, for instance,

01:39:14
I mean, what could I think of as an example?

01:39:20
I mean, when you try to understand urban life,

01:39:23
being sensitive to how you're inserted

01:39:30
in the global network of cities could be one way

01:39:32
to appreciate your own positionality.

01:39:35
So if you're a citizen of a city like in Shasta,

01:39:38
which is an exploitative or subordinate relation

01:39:40
to other cities in the world,

01:39:46
Let me give you a hint of why your living conditions are that bad, whereas sociologist

01:39:53
may perhaps start explaining that from local cultures, local society characteristics,

01:39:55
political system, etc.

01:40:00
The geographer would, for instance, try to put that in perspective, say, look, there's

01:40:06
a no-for-racking system, a world system of sorts, and maybe we can talk about this next

01:40:10
week that allows to explain that a little bit better.

01:40:23
Okay, but I think, yeah, and that connects a little bit to the next thing and the sociological imagination.

01:40:30
And these are the words, I mean, this is what they've created, Harvey writes and social justice in the city.

01:40:38
It enables the possess it when it stands the larger historical scene in terms of its meaning for in-a-life and external career of writing of individuals.

01:40:44
For the sociological imagination enables us to grasp history and biography and relation between the two in society.

01:40:49
So it's about think about issues like class and how knowledge is produced.

01:40:55
what kind of questions that you ask that are predefined or not predefined by

01:41:02
shaped by your own class identity differences or identity. To acknowledge that

01:41:06
would be one thing. But Harvey says the spatial imagination enables the

01:41:11
individual to recognize the role of space and place and so on biography. So take

01:41:21
for instance somebody from South Africa who starts teaching in London as a

01:41:28
geographer, how with this personal trajectory lead to some kind of a focus on

01:41:33
issues of what is modernity, what is non-modernity, what is development, what is

01:41:38
under development and those kinds of things. So how brings us a career as a

01:41:41
to the global south, going to the global north,

01:41:44
might shape the questions that are being asked.

01:41:47
Next to just issues of class at Missity

01:41:51
and other elements that may shape positionality.

01:41:54
I could use the example of Jennifer Robinson, for instance,

01:41:55
from the fitness exercise.

01:41:58
And she came up with the idea of ordinary cities,

01:42:00
somehow debunking the whole idea

01:42:03
that would be extraordinary world cities,

01:42:05
and then the rest, OK?

01:42:10
So just saying that in your personal biographies,

01:42:13
your spatial trajectory and your spatial relations

01:42:16
with other places may also have an impact

01:42:20
on the kind of questions that you're asking.

01:42:23
I'm not saying that sociologists are blind,

01:42:27
but they just ask different kind of questions.

01:42:28
Okay.

01:42:31
Now for me, I mean, these are difficult theoretical discussions

01:42:35
and it's also not a epistemological, epistemology class,

01:42:42
But I think it's safe to say that as human geographers were interested in the interactions

01:42:49
between space and society, how spaces, shape societies and individuals and vice versa,

01:42:53
how individuals and societies shaped their environments.

01:43:01
And this is kind of what, at so jump, a famous American job for a call, the social

01:43:09
spatial dialectic. And then you translate that to cities. It's how urban societies make

01:43:16
the places they live in. And at the same time, how urban space morphologically or otherwise

01:43:21
has, again, back an influence on urban life as groups and individuals. Think about

01:43:28
segregation, which shows a segregated social structure. It's something social, but also

01:43:33
So will the fine kind of interactions that you have with others in driven space.

01:43:37
And they have an impact on what kind of encounters you have in the city.

01:43:46
They have an impact on how privileged you are to what extent you know other social groups

01:43:47
and societies, etc.

01:43:52
So space, one example that you're going to the work of Nikhil later on, that shows that

01:43:59
space has in itself some kind of autonomous form of explanation. I'm very

01:44:05
the friends as a job for as you can see because as all geographers I have an

01:44:10
identity crisis but that's kind of a very productive one I would say because

01:44:16
this kind of typifies the history of post-war history of geography. Maybe

01:44:21
other geographers will recognize that. Yeah so the social spatial dialectic

01:44:27
perhaps as a synthesis what we can land on our society's people,

01:44:33
make spaces and how it works back to them. And thinking about the autonomous power of space

01:44:45
and explaining stuff. As an example, if I can, can I? Yes. Four ways, I mean you mentioned already,

01:44:49
it's thinking about different concepts of space, territory, scale, network,

01:44:57
place or common ways of thinking about space. And we point to different kind of spatial processes.

01:45:03
And again, it's not that one is better than the other to understand what is happening.

01:45:10
But as I will try to show by the example of Brussels, it's kind of seeking tension between these

01:45:16
different concepts that gets us a little bit closer to understanding, for instance, in this case,

01:45:25
the conundrum that Brussels poses. So one way of looking at the city of Brussels is a territorial

01:45:31
one. It has a particular jurisdiction. It's the Brussels capital region which emerged as a region

01:45:38
somewhere in the 1990s, next to Flanger's Hamelonia, and it has so competences, it has a government

01:45:45
argument. We can do stuff, the side stuff on the territory, but not on the culture because that's

01:45:51
something that is being decided by Columbus and the Francophone community.

01:45:58
But other than that, there's kind of sovereignty on that level as what can be decided.

01:46:01
So it's a very strict kind of bounded space.

01:46:06
If you walk 10 meters outside those boundaries in principle,

01:46:09
the Brussels government can't say anything about you.

01:46:14
And on the other hand, it also can erect all kinds of barriers,

01:46:19
as long as one wants to add another lane to the ring road across Brussels,

01:46:23
because it has very centered on car mobility.

01:46:29
Well, there's a waste of blocking that, because there are certain stretches of the ring road,

01:46:32
when Brussels can say, "No, let's not do that here."

01:46:35
And then the end-to-end up still with the bottlenecks.

01:46:49
Okay, so this is territorial power to some extent, which has also been used by the Brussels government saying everything is 50 kilometers an hour max when you entered our territory.

01:46:57
So yeah, take it or leave it. So with territorial view, what Brussels could be?

01:47:02
One would be more scalar view and scale.

01:47:04
Yeah, you could say it's a spatial scale.

01:47:08
It's kind of a sensitivity to different processes

01:47:10
work on different scales.

01:47:12
Some of them are really micro teaching

01:47:16
is a micro process taking place in the scale here

01:47:19
of the classroom.

01:47:22
Whereas you could say, commuting is something that's

01:47:25
big place at the far larger scale.

01:47:31
as we go home, it's a process that radically goes beyond the boundaries of this class.

01:47:35
It's the same when you look at economic activities.

01:47:40
If you look at the metropolitan area more logically,

01:47:45
Brussels is actually much larger than the Brussels capital feature.

01:47:52
So if you were to define Brussels as a scale of where urban activities take place,

01:47:57
you could end up halfway to flongers or halfway to Bologna.

01:48:02
So it radically deborders the territory that is the Brussels capital region.

01:48:11
In contrast to other contexts, there has not been a very successful process of, you could say,

01:48:20
city regionalization, where there was some kind of governance expansion to manage the

01:48:21
the metropolitan process.

01:48:25
And a lot of context to see that new governance structures

01:48:29
have been erected, think about London, for instance,

01:48:33
it hugely exceeds the original heartland of London,

01:48:35
but includes more and more of its peripheries,

01:48:41
because these places are connected to the urban area.

01:48:43
This is not what happened in Brussels,

01:48:45
and this has something to do with the fact

01:48:50
that is a very commonitarian sense definition,

01:48:53
because it deals with all kinds of issues

01:48:57
of redistribution of income, et cetera.

01:49:00
We have to keep in mind that about 60% of Belgian GDP

01:49:05
is generated in Brussels, but it's not being governed

01:49:08
into its totality by the Brussels government.

01:49:11
In fact, and that brings us to the third one,

01:49:13
it's a matter of perspective.

01:49:16
There's all kinds of micro networks,

01:49:19
and in this case, this is the commuting map of Belgium,

01:49:22
that makes that the surplus that has been generated

01:49:24
by all these activities and Brussels,

01:49:26
I think about head order functions,

01:49:28
you're being functioned that apparently

01:49:31
accounts for a quarter of the Brussels economy,

01:49:34
it actually leaks to the periphery.

01:49:36
So it leaks beyond the borders of the territory

01:49:39
of the Brussels capital region,

01:49:41
a lot of people including myself,

01:49:50
work in Brussels, but basically paid taxes outside of Brussels.

01:49:56
So I didn't get this beautiful old city in Belgium.

01:49:59
And I get taxed in flounders.

01:50:02
I spent a lot of money well, not so much,

01:50:03
because I worked too much.

01:50:07
I could spend a lot of money in Ghent.

01:50:10
But it basically is some kind of fiscal leakage

01:50:13
from territory, right?

01:50:17
And this is a problem of Brussels.

01:50:22
We also could talk about Europe, rats, who are not texts at all,

01:50:23
but work in Brussels.

01:50:27
So we can wonder about the multiplier, economic multiplier

01:50:30
that's being created by all these activities in Brussels.

01:50:33
And that means that, yeah, there's a lot of large visiting

01:50:38
class, about 400 commuters come to Brussels every day.

01:50:42
Well, pre-corona, let's see if it's still the case.

01:50:46
But the use of city dispense time on the infrastructure,

01:50:50
but not necessarily paying for that.

01:50:53
And I'll spare you details of other kinds of ways

01:50:56
of raging deaths as solidarity then between the regions

01:51:01
of Flounders, for instance, space a number of billions

01:51:04
every year to Brussels as a sign of solidarity,

01:51:07
where you can also frame it as just bamed bill

01:51:11
for being on the metro and Brussels, using it every day.

01:51:15
So there's kind of a discussion there.

01:51:18
And it also is framed in very, at a terrible,

01:51:22
humanitarian terms.

01:51:27
And this is kind of when you use a concept like place,

01:51:29
it gets you a bit closer to these processes,

01:51:31
how people attach meanings to this place.

01:51:35
So Brussels and how it's represented in Belgium media

01:51:43
or Flemming's media, I invite you to buy a Flemming newspaper and run it to Google

01:51:50
to see how Brussels is being represented, is particular frame, which has been augmented

01:51:59
or essentialized even further as we had the terrorist attacks in 2016, where even Mr.

01:52:04
former president Trump described normally as a health hole.

01:52:10
I was very nicely taken over by a Chinese media because it kind of resonates with the idea of

01:52:21
yeah, unsafe image of Brussels, dirty image of Brussels.

01:52:24
And yeah, so it kind of resonates there.

01:52:31
what you see is especially is that this also, say, reenacted in the entire COVID crisis, we're

01:52:38
again, it's the same frame of yeah, Brussels got managed, look at vaccination rates, it doesn't get

01:52:45
it for the relationship control, they're messing up again. If we were independent and flowers, yeah,

01:52:51
that we could be of all kinds of other COVID regulations, etc. That would be free already. So it's kind

01:52:58
of this frame of attaching certain meanings to certain places there's big. So if you just go to

01:53:07
Lidakaka, or you could also take Delbeak, it's a big sign, who are flarming in Thursday. And so it's

01:53:19
Lidakaka, it's somewhere here. So it's really in balance on Brussels in terms of commuting.

01:53:26
But what you see is that with the kind of return of higher and residential functions to city

01:53:32
to city of Brussels, that there's actually a lot of displacement going on and a lot of people

01:53:38
that used to live in what they call the residual housing market still affordable housing in Brussels,

01:53:45
it's actually being pushed out and it's increasingly computing to Brussels from further

01:53:51
further away. So in a sense you can say Brussels is spilling over all the way to

01:53:56
Lidicakka. What you see is that there is a very strong opposition by

01:54:02
either deterring parties, a local mayor, which is really trying to form a

01:54:08
kind of bridge, if you will towards all that is foreign in this case Brussels.

01:54:17
Okay, so, Lydicarica is placed in opposition to this process of urbanization there.

01:54:22
We can think about it what we want when it's certainly something that is explaining a lot

01:54:29
of the tensions between Brussels and its growing intellect.

01:54:37
So for takes of Brussels to a four different kind of spatial approaches and I think

01:54:46
combining them tells us a bit more about what on earth Brussels as a city is.

01:54:50
Okay, is there still time?

01:54:55
You still have time for one minute of thinking about what being critical means?

01:54:58
I think eight minutes we can stop.

01:55:02
So one minute of thinking of what is critical,

01:55:04
not in a sense your condition is critical,

01:55:07
but what is critical urban studies

01:55:10
or critical urban geography for you.

01:55:11
What does that mean?

01:55:14
(audience laughing)

01:55:24
(crowd talking)

01:55:27
(crowd talking)

01:55:55
[ Background Sounds ]

01:56:05
[BLANK_AUDIO]

01:56:09
>> What does that mean?

01:56:16
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:56:25
[ Inaudible ]

01:56:29
Yeah, so the question is what you hear, what you see?

01:56:31
Okay, even what is being.

01:56:33
Okay. Okay.

01:56:43
[ Inaudible ]

01:56:46
So it connects a bit to what you were saying.

01:56:49
Fact checking certain statements.

01:56:50
See where I just come from.

01:56:51
Yeah?

01:56:52
I want to build on that.

01:56:54
I want to make a stage as being aware of your own bias

01:56:58
with like confirmation bias, cherry picking up

01:57:01
something that's a huge help with being green goes well.

01:57:03
Cherry picking up what is that?

01:57:04
Can you explain that?

01:57:10
Cherry picking is the fun of picking up your sources.

01:57:17
while you have IDA and your only code source that also of same owners that also represent IDA,

01:57:19
it's regarding all the other apps.

01:57:23
Can you go back to the results to the latest selection?

01:57:24
Yeah.

01:57:27
So being reflexive about your madness, yes.

01:57:28
Bye.

01:57:39
[ Inaudible ]

01:57:43
[ Inaudible ]

01:57:45
>> Carried.

01:57:46
And okay.

01:57:47
And Carried.

01:57:48
How exactly?

01:57:50
That's an interesting term.

01:57:53
[ Inaudible ]

01:57:56
and then you can get to life.

01:57:58
And I think it's right here.

01:58:00
And I like to thank the market for that.

01:58:02
And what should we care about?

01:58:05
Christine.

01:58:06
(audience laughs)

01:58:07
True.

01:58:08
And please.

01:58:09
Yeah.

01:58:10
Any particular process yet?

01:58:14
I think I just like being fully and totally

01:58:19
having an approach that is politically engaged

01:58:22
and also making a form of his answer.

01:58:31
This means different actors, especially the marginalized and not the public.

01:58:35
It's crucial to ourselves all knowledge.

01:58:37
Interesting.

01:58:38
Yeah.

01:59:04
[ Inaudible ]

01:59:07
I have to hold myself in the discussion.

01:59:08
But it's an interesting point.

01:59:11
I think it's about the critical about what effect is.

01:59:16
Personally, I would say, it says how to have a fact as produced

01:59:18
to use Bruno La Proul.

01:59:23
In the sense that if you put men in white jackets,

01:59:25
it would give certain people the more power

01:59:27
to actually produce a fact.

01:59:29
Whereas, for voices, marginal voices

01:59:31
would not be in that position.

01:59:32
Yeah?

01:59:37
It seems like, I could feel level and involve, like,

01:59:39
keep your life the implications of the way

01:59:42
you're conceptualizing things are in terms of economic

01:59:46
and social, in terms of that, and re-evaluating

01:59:48
the theory of their framework.

01:59:50
So you're using things not where you're hiding on that.

01:59:52
Yeah, interesting.

01:59:56
So again, being a reflexive about your own positionality,

02:00:00
going to piece out, to what extent your positionality

02:00:07
shapes the questions you ask and I try to address that.

02:00:29
[ Inaudible ]

02:00:35
>> Yeah. So knowledge production as a power-related process.

02:00:40
where some boys are sound louder than others.

02:00:46
It reduces the thing that also has geographical implications

02:00:49
because it's not just some people, I mean,

02:00:52
over in days when spatial structures think about local,

02:00:55
local, local, local self, that's happening.

02:00:56
Okay, thanks a lot.

02:00:57
I mean, exactly.

02:01:00
I mean, I have not so much to add to that.

02:01:03
You can take the definition of Jonas at all

02:01:06
And I think it catches some of the things that were being said.

02:01:14
Think about new concepts that reveal something that we didn't know yet, kind of obvious, but still.

02:01:19
Think about being politically engaged, yes.

02:01:25
Something that matters one way or another, but be reflexive about the fact that

02:01:31
some things might really matter and be picked up, but not necessarily be, you could say, very progressive.

02:01:38
I mean, in a fascist society, there's all kinds of knowledge on segregation to be produced

02:01:43
that is very useful, and you could be extremely politically engaged in that, but not necessarily

02:01:48
thinking about, you could say, marginalized forces there.

02:01:54
Third point indeed, taking seriously the experiences, life, practice, and words of ordinary

02:02:00
urban residents or marginalized social groups to think about, really, okay, we have this

02:02:05
hegemonic representation, what would happen if you would ask different people with

02:02:10
wisdom in a different positionality, etc., etc. Obviously you have your

02:02:15
positionality as a researcher in yourself and maybe sometimes very hard

02:02:22
for instance as a man to study from his perspectives. He may also be not

02:02:29
recognized as being a rightful person to study in these kind of aspects. So I

02:02:37
I think it's a kind of a negotiation process there and then again, or think about women

02:02:45
that focus on the liteness of investment banking in the city, think about work within the

02:02:51
McDowell for instance, and how it's a difficult process for women to actually enter these

02:02:57
spaces, have access. But once they get access, they ask very different questions that

02:03:02
actually leading quite revolutionary concerns.

02:03:06
And now to another formulation, and that's why I was a little bit hesitant with

02:03:14
there are no facts. I don't agree. I think there are facts, in a sense that there are factual

02:03:23
realities. And you see this kind of kind of middle ground between you could say, shoot

02:03:28
as being something that's being constructed, but you always have to construct it on the basis

02:03:37
of some kind of empirical factual reality. So not radical deconstruction or post-structuralist thinking.

02:03:44
There's always a way of saying this is, I don't know the entire truth, but this is probably

02:03:51
a little bit more true than something else. And yeah, you can write the citation, a re-decitation

02:03:55
Sorry, what he says is that the ultimate goal

02:04:00
is to reduce illusion in society and of itself.

02:04:05
So if you have sharp needs, they not go.

02:04:07
And with the vocabulary in concepts,

02:04:08
you can work with that.

02:04:11
And you will see things perhaps in a different life

02:04:17
and take away false beliefs and illusions in society.

02:04:21
And it also means that it's a kind of a placeless

02:04:25
and timeless definition is sense that this could be the mission, for instance, of critical

02:04:31
urban studies or critical urban geography. And what is critical and what is a false belief

02:04:35
and what is an illusion may change over time. But it's kind of, it keeps holding as a

02:04:45
finishing, but it may have to be updated in terms of habits. So some rules of thumb, there's

02:04:51
There's no universal theory of anything, and I think we'll show that.

02:04:58
We have to be sensitive to the fact that every theory has its birthmarks.

02:05:04
What were the questions that really gave rise to formulating a research question to a theory

02:05:06
in a particular way?

02:05:12
Well, we'll have to take a look at the context of historical and station to understand

02:05:13
what that was.

02:05:19
So think about the Chicago School that you'll be talking about with Nick.

02:05:23
It was assumed to be universal model.

02:05:29
There's actually a model of a city that captures rapid urbanization in the early 20th century

02:05:31
and northern Europe.

02:05:34
And then the question to what extent it actually explains something in different locations

02:05:36
and different times.

02:05:40
We're not going to reject that, but we have to mobilize that concept and see how far

02:05:41
we get.

02:05:44
So we have to be reflexive about these bird marks.

02:05:50
So, even the concept of class is something that is a western inception, if you will.

02:05:54
To an extent, does it allow to actually capture, for instance, Indian society?

02:06:01
So we need to kind of provincialize theory and say, okay, it originated at some point.

02:06:05
And now we can meaningfully think about how we can speak of course context.

02:06:11
So think about a global city as a concept that emerged,

02:06:14
say mostly in Northern America, Western Europe,

02:06:16
what extent does it allow to capture what is going on

02:06:18
in Singapore for instance?

02:06:23
So to play while being reflexive about these concepts

02:06:25
with the application across the country.

02:06:28
And engaged pluralism, that's kind of, I mean,

02:06:30
might be for engaged pluralism.

02:06:32
It means that there are different kind of theoretical stances,

02:06:34
different kind of question being passed,

02:06:37
entering from different kind of teams.

02:06:42
And I think it's not just about acknowledging that,

02:06:44
but it's actually engaging with this kind of

02:06:48
dissenting opinions and trying to look for a conversation.

02:06:50
And maybe we can talk a little bit more about that

02:06:53
next week or in the next sessions.

02:06:58
As Purbin studies has drawn and become ever more global,

02:07:01
as the urbanization has also globalized,

02:07:09
There's always a risk that has some work that will become lost and in comparison to use the words of Jamie back.

02:07:18
That we lose our points of reference to actually be able to have some kind of coherent urban studies project or at least speak to one another.

02:07:24
So I think there's a danger with a global research agenda with so many contextual differences.

02:07:27
How do we still make sense of urban processes

02:07:31
when Singapore versus Brussels?

02:07:33
How do you put them there?

02:07:36
Now, I want to bore you now to that with the next two slides

02:07:41
too much, but I just want to say that what geography was

02:07:43
and what kind of critical questions

02:07:48
were asked has changed tremendously throughout time.

02:07:51
Much of geography originally was really

02:07:56
about human interaction with the environment,

02:07:59
say environmental determinism where it was really

02:08:02
believed, yes, it's really the physical environment

02:08:05
that would shape human activities.

02:08:07
Regional geography was also a very big tradition,

02:08:10
especially before the Second World War,

02:08:12
where it was really about the description

02:08:15
of human activities in their physical region.

02:08:17
There's still some tradition there.

02:08:20
But what really happened after the Second World War,

02:08:22
Most were any, especially since the 70s,

02:08:24
it was a period of, let's say,

02:08:27
a social and political economic upheaval

02:08:32
is a huge branching out of geography.

02:08:36
So there's quite a plurality of traditions there.

02:08:40
And they take us quite far from the origins of geography,

02:08:44
which was really about settlements, if you will,

02:08:48
and the pre-World War era was about, okay,

02:08:51
show East India and where are the settlements

02:08:55
or describe me the structure of a city.

02:08:58
Of the second world war, especially in the United States,

02:09:01
it was a kind of a nomotetic move.

02:09:03
And we have to formalize this.

02:09:05
And you have for instance, Walter Castella

02:09:09
who came with quite a neat model to explain

02:09:12
why at certain locations you had certain settlements

02:09:14
over certain sides.

02:09:17
Or for instance, the O's and what's going on,

02:09:19
start formalizing the idea.

02:09:22
OK, if there's certain activities within the city

02:09:26
at a certain space, it must have something to do with the kind

02:09:29
of value that is being generated by those activities.

02:09:32
And the fact that some activities out

02:09:34
with others on a certain location.

02:09:36
So these are kind of foundational approaches.

02:09:37
And I'm going very fast here.

02:09:41
I know, but it's just to take note of that,

02:09:48
This led to much more plural discussion as of the '70s.

02:09:52
And I can't really do justice to hold these different traditions

02:09:52
here.

02:09:56
But what you could say, more radical and critical voices

02:09:58
share in one tradition, you could say,

02:10:04
yes, questions of social justice, distribution.

02:10:08
They work in a materialist setting for what people have

02:10:10
and how this class, for instance, income,

02:10:16
It's a track pass, how does that explain the visions in the city?

02:10:20
Nice names, such as David Harvey, Neil Smith,

02:10:22
and I think the fair that those were kind of

02:10:24
periods with a lot of social change,

02:10:29
where social mobility of the working class in 1970s.

02:10:33
Feminine's geographies that also emerged at this point,

02:10:39
questioning male dominated views on society, et cetera.

02:10:42
So thinking about placing geography,

02:10:46
relating it to the process of capitalism.

02:10:50
The other big strands you could say,

02:10:56
is more you could say a humanistic geography

02:11:00
that thinks about urban lifestyles, urban behaviors,

02:11:04
urban cultures, which less kind of relates itself

02:11:08
to capitalism in a sense.

02:11:11
but really starts with, okay, what kind of forces

02:11:13
haven't we heard in the city?

02:11:16
How are cities being experienced?

02:11:18
Can we think about the power of representation?

02:11:21
How different spaces are being represented?

02:11:23
What the power of discourse is?

02:11:25
It's not just about material circumstances,

02:11:27
it's also how we think about certain places

02:11:30
that will explain what they've explained.

02:11:32
And also, we shift towards more important things,

02:11:34
all of the different methods

02:11:39
that kind of specifies the cultural term more widely.

02:11:41
And this is not the end of a conversation,

02:11:43
I would say, and that's kind of your buttons

02:11:46
of purpose of this more widely

02:11:48
and urban journey, particularly,

02:11:51
that all these different approaches exist next to one another.

02:11:54
But you have to kind of be aware

02:11:56
that they work in different kinds of traditions

02:12:00
and then formulate questions in a particular way.

02:12:03
And I think you will see returning here and there

02:12:05
throughout the course, somebody who works,

02:12:07
perhaps a little bit more in that framework,

02:12:09
was thought to refer to that tradition,

02:12:10
and it's something to be aware of.

02:12:12
I can't adjust this to the history of geography

02:12:16
in three slides, that would be over the top,

02:12:18
but it's something to think about.

02:12:21
Okay, I'll end there.

02:12:23
Sorry, it's for taking a little bit longer.

02:12:26
By next week, please try to get over

02:12:29
over these two texts, or share it with your colleagues,

02:12:34
And the world city hypothesis by John Friedman and Paul B.

02:12:38
And somewhat less old, but still already bit later.

02:12:40
Text by Sosel.

02:12:41
Sosel.

02:12:47
Not to be quite a mixed bit of muscles.

02:12:51
All right.

02:12:52
Thank you very much.

02:12:56
And see you next week.

# 2 Theories of world-city formation

00:00:22
[ Music ]

00:00:25
>> Welcome everybody and evening.

00:00:28
Welcome to the second session.

00:00:39
of urban social geography. Thanks for being here despite the live stream and the

00:00:45
recording. I think it really makes sense to be here so we can have a bit of an

00:00:54
interactive session. How did you arrive in Brussels first week? Everything going

00:00:55
Okay, yeah.

00:00:58
Yeah, okay.

00:01:01
Your landing still a little bit.

00:01:08
How did you find a stonselow for those attending?

00:01:12
Did someone attend?

00:01:14
Stonselows, yeah.

00:01:18
Then I'll live up to your expectations more or less.

00:01:27
And you find it weird and they started with over 50%

00:01:29
of the urban population lifts and cities.

00:01:31
That was on the first slide.

00:01:34
OK.

00:01:36
We didn't have a deal that she would put that on there.

00:01:40
But I can see her critical minds.

00:01:44
You can start thinking about first slides so that we have

00:01:45
her answers here.

00:01:47
Ready?

00:01:48
OK.

00:01:50
Today we'll be talking about--

00:01:57
I could say an important chunk of research into urban geography.

00:02:03
Most of my geographers, yes.

00:02:09
I haven't. No, last week that. Yeah, it didn't work.

00:02:11
Yeah, you remember? Yes.

00:02:14
Okay. That's what, no, this system doesn't work.

00:02:16
I'm not sure why.

00:02:21
have a singing voice, so I'll try to project my ideas.

00:02:25
And if you don't hear it, I can give it a bit higher or louder.

00:02:29
But maybe we should be a little bit quiet

00:02:31
and then that will help as well.

00:02:33
So, rural cities, global cities,

00:02:36
one of the big debates I think in urban geography

00:02:37
and urban cities more widely.

00:02:42
It's also a very long standing debate going back

00:02:47
at least the eighties, which probably also explains what you had to read all

00:02:55
stuff that you may or may not find outdated. I hope it's not outdated. They're

00:02:59
all text but I think it's still relevant in one way or another and we'll also

00:03:04
try to discuss that a little bit. Now what's the structure of today? There's

00:03:13
three main parts of this lecture. First of all, we're going to discuss, I mean very generally,

00:03:17
the centrality of cities and city regions in the global economy and we'll take you through

00:03:23
three complementary views, I've used that built on one another by Joe Friedman, Sosca,

00:03:29
Sosca, and Alan Scott. Secondly, so that's kind of a conceptual theoretical discussion.

00:03:36
Secondly, we'll have more of a methodological discussion, which deals with how given these

00:03:41
concepts how we can actually measure and say something empirical about world cities and

00:03:43
global cities.

00:03:49
And one of the main methodologies there is the methodology by GOG, which is the globalization

00:03:55
and world cities research network, which was founded somewhere in the 1990s by Peter Taylor.

00:04:01
has been one of the main, you could say, empirical methodological contributions to the

00:04:04
debate from that period.

00:04:13
And third of all, as we'll learn, there was some kind of a dominance by Gorg, if you will,

00:04:18
in this area of cities in globalization.

00:04:24
And there is a dominant voice, there is also quite a bit of friendly and unfriendly critique

00:04:33
criticism toward this particular framing of global safety and world safety formation.

00:04:41
And I think going into these debates is actually quite telling as to how we define global

00:04:48
cities where we think that that criticism is justified, whereas perhaps less justified,

00:04:52
very beautiful with other kind of issues. And I'll be talking about four of those

00:04:57
points of criticism. One you could call the post-colonial critique, a social

00:05:02
constructivist critique, people that talk about state riskailing on the role of

00:05:07
the state and then finally some brilliant minds that had something to say

00:05:13
about financialization, okay, and that may alter our reading of what actually

00:05:23
happens in global cities. But before we start, my question to you, why are cities central

00:05:29
in the global economy and what would it mean to say that cities are actually powerful,

00:05:36
economically powerful? Take a minute, talk to your neighbor right-time few notes and think

00:05:45
about what your own should-could be. Go ahead.

00:05:48
(audience laughing)

00:05:51

00:05:54

00:06:44
[ Music ]

00:06:47
(people chattering)

00:07:16
[ Background Sounds ]

00:07:26
Okay, first idea is the most creative walks.

00:07:37
Yeah, so how are cities central and global economy and why how can we see that you're powerful?

00:07:41
Is he burning hand?

00:07:42
Please, raise your hand.

00:07:46
I'm just celebrating focusing on either of us

00:07:47
to focus on.

00:07:50
And so basically, like in the papers

00:07:52
where we were kind of pointing out

00:07:54
that the [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:00
the congress centers of markets and of national companies.

00:08:04
And that's why it gets more and more forward sometimes

00:08:06
even more than the nation states are

00:08:11
motivated because they become a part of this international network

00:08:13
of those protocols they use.

00:08:17
And on the other hand, it's like most of the

00:08:20
effectiveness, most of the capital,

00:08:24
mostly not to be rural these days,

00:08:29
but also like function capital is placed in those big cities.

00:08:32
And that's why you have kind of helped this

00:08:36
when you call the migration of high-perfiting

00:08:39
those doors to go home, we'll see you.

00:08:40
Okay, thank you.

00:08:44
So if something with these are the seats of corporate power

00:08:48
and perhaps it leads that goes around those corporations.

00:08:52
Okay, otherwise there's, yeah, the battery.

00:08:54
(mumbling)

00:09:18
[ Inaudible ]

00:09:33
Okay, so not just economic processes, but also the power of people and ideas culture's diversity.

00:09:37
Okay, all the ideas?

00:09:38
Yes.

00:09:40
This is built on the way, for example,

00:09:42
but flows, because this is the only thing

00:09:46
that we would do, that all these flows come together

00:09:48
in large cities, and then it becomes more than,

00:09:50
it goes from this large city to another large city,

00:09:55
a better, most better than the national level.

00:09:56
Instead of going from the large city

00:09:59
to the enterprise by venturing,

00:10:02
the most between cities and that's excellent.

00:10:05
And what is the substance of these flows?

00:10:06
It can be anything that can provide

00:10:11
to acknowledge to people who are in this community as well.

00:10:14
Okay, one of the things, yeah.

00:10:17
I think about, I think that they,

00:10:20
I think government has been telling,

00:10:24
you know, they told me I like budget and make

00:10:26
rural, that affects, you know,

00:10:29
like, separate people, all of the people.

00:10:32
It's kind of the Benjamin Barber argument,

00:10:34
what if Mayor Siru to the world,

00:10:41
world. There's a lot of context, you could say the main equipment centers are also important

00:10:45
political centers and the national economy and the national politics. And it seems to be also that

00:10:50
there are some kind of an extraterritorial or supernatural authority there as well.

00:10:55
Okay, thanks a lot for your answers. I think there's other options to talk about, but I think you

00:11:02
already got to some of the essential points. I'm going to show you a bit of a data list of figures,

00:11:09
But just to give a little bit of exhibits as to how important economic terms

00:11:14
then and perhaps also think that political terms, some world cities or world city regions or

00:11:23
global city regions are. This is a list and this is research by a certain man named Alombrecht

00:11:30
from the early North East. Nick compared the main, you could say leading metropolitan areas in

00:11:36
in Western Europe. So it's by no means an international comparison at the global scale.

00:11:43
But it's comparing Delta Metropolis. This is basically Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague, etc.

00:11:50
The Flamish Diamond, which is roughly speaking Ghent Antwerp, Nervin Brussels,

00:11:55
which is kind of the economic heartland, if you still remember in Belgium,

00:12:02
Rairan-Rur area, which is Western Germany, kind of old industrial area, which is a large

00:12:06
conservation with a lot of industrial activity, or at least it used to be.

00:12:12
You, the France, this is basically Greater Paris and then Greater London is Greater London.

00:12:17
Okay? So comparing these five areas on a number of characteristics and you also see

00:12:22
the next figures, what he kind of finds is that these region city regions, much of

00:12:25
often areas are punching above their weight.

00:12:28
If you compare the share in a national surface,

00:12:32
so the size in terms of built up structure,

00:12:36
then the complete territory is actually quite small.

00:12:42
And you compare that to figures in population,

00:12:46
this largely outweigh the share in national territory.

00:12:50
And then when you look at the share of these areas in GDP,

00:12:52
which is kind of the value,

00:12:56
total value of all economic transactions,

00:12:58
which is a full measure in many ways,

00:13:02
but it's one way of starting to compare national economies.

00:13:05
We see that these areas actually

00:13:06
point about their rates.

00:13:09
So for instance, when you look at the Flemish diamond,

00:13:12
to take the Belgian example, 30% of national service,

00:13:15
52% of the population lives there,

00:13:19
but 63% of all economic activities actually

00:13:22
they place there.

00:13:25
More striking figures are even there for Paris.

00:13:30
London only 1% of the territory about, we

00:13:34
could say, 1/10 to 1/5 of the population,

00:13:37
but in terms of economic power,

00:13:41
especially in the case of Paris, it's way bigger than you

00:13:42
would in this.

00:13:46
So on large agglomeration and concentration,

00:13:48
of you could say economic transactions

00:13:51
that is taking place.

00:13:53
It also means that a lot of these places

00:13:57
tend to be richer than their hinterlands.

00:14:01
So it's kind of a runaway process at something

00:14:03
when these activities that are taking place there,

00:14:05
that generates more wealth per capita.

00:14:07
So this is GDP per head.

00:14:11
So it divides the value of economic activities

00:14:14
by the total population in that city.

00:14:19
So typically these places are richer than your pain

00:14:24
average and also compared to the rest of the encounter.

00:14:26
In that sense, when you look at Brussels,

00:14:33
Brussels is, you could say, the richest city in Belgium.

00:14:36
In principle, richer than the rest of Belgium.

00:14:38
But as we discussed last week, there's

00:14:41
a lot of this well actually in leaking to the periphery,

00:14:44
which is actually in flawless and mononia.

00:14:46
So it doesn't really show when you look at

00:14:48
at figures from the press of capital region,

00:14:50
but the same would actually apply.

00:14:54
Another way of looking at it is that,

00:14:56
and this was kind of referred to by

00:14:59
the concentration also of ideas innovation people.

00:15:02
It's very difficult to measure that.

00:15:06
One way of doing it is looking at patents, right?

00:15:08
Which is a kind of certification,

00:15:13
legal certification that something has been invented in one area or another,

00:15:18
a COVID vaccine, some kind of a chick, an algorithm, whatever.

00:15:21
And it has intellectual property on it.

00:15:23
So, and it can be commercialized in one way or not.

00:15:29
But it's a very, you could say, post hoc, exposed kind of measurement of places.

00:15:32
And there, there, there, a measure of innovation.

00:15:35
But it's a way to compare different areas.

00:15:43
What you see is that here it's a bit more mixed, a few, for instance, in France, you

00:15:49
see that Paris is actually outperforming the rest of the country.

00:15:54
This is far less the case in the UK, but it is the case in France's "The Flammish

00:15:55
Dark."

00:16:01
It's a bit more of a bit mixed picture, but we see that in general there's a tendency

00:16:04
to locate, you could say, innovative processes

00:16:06
as evidence to battles.

00:16:10
There's a lot of innovation that is not being measured here,

00:16:12
no social innovation, for instance.

00:16:16
It's really linked to technologies, high-end services

00:16:18
and these.

00:16:24
When you look at the structure of labor market,

00:16:26
you see that typically metropolitan areas

00:16:34
These also show a higher share of highly educated, highly educated work.

00:16:41
So substantially bigger, say in the delta metropolis,

00:16:46
it's 30% of highly educated people compared

00:16:49
to more or less 20% in the rest of the netlands.

00:16:53
And you can have a look at the other cities

00:16:54
to see how it fits.

00:16:57
So a different kind of labor market structure,

00:17:00
which tells us something about the kinds of activities

00:17:01
that are probably taking place there.

00:17:08
And another indicator there is when you look at

00:17:11
the employment figures across different kinds of sectors.

00:17:15
So there's the three sector model

00:17:19
that's agriculture industry and services.

00:17:23
And we see that obviously agriculture is very small,

00:17:26
but that's a constant everywhere,

00:17:29
but that there's a significant large share

00:17:32
and services in these metropolitan areas

00:17:35
than in the rest of the country.

00:17:37
So it's, these are places that are not marked

00:17:41
by industry, but by service economies.

00:17:45
So these are just a number of exhibits

00:17:47
that tell you something about the economic importance,

00:17:52
but it doesn't really tell you why these places are important.

00:17:55
It's just kind of a hint that something is going on.

00:17:59
And actually you already mentioned quite a few ideas

00:18:02
of how we can theorize the centrality

00:18:05
or at least conceptualize the centrality and power

00:18:08
in off cities in the global economy.

00:18:14
One of the main texts that is in the reader for this week

00:18:16
was this relatively hypothesis by John

00:18:21
to throw red it so you can just interrupt me

00:18:24
if you want to interject something.

00:18:26
But I just want to give you a number of notes

00:18:31
of my personal notes on what John Friedman was actually

00:18:33
writing about.

00:18:38
So a bit of context to this thesis or high hypothesis,

00:18:43
it's a hypothesis that groups a number of observations

00:18:46
from the 1980s tries to come up with a bit of a research

00:18:51
a gentle, that meets empirical testing.

00:18:52
Right?

00:18:54
But you need to understand a bit more of this context

00:18:56
of the 1980s.

00:19:00
People of my age have to have the habit of starting history

00:19:03
in the 1980s, because it was the decade they were born.

00:19:04
If I was 10 years older, I was probably

00:19:06
going to refer the 1970s.

00:19:10
But as a toddler, this was my context, right?

00:19:16
So you have to remember that 1980s was this emerging kind

00:19:24
idea that we would experience the end of the city. It was the rise of information and

00:19:30
communication technology on a very democratic large scale, not yet the internet, but that was

00:19:37
emerging in the 1990s and being democratized, cheap mass transportation became very cheap to fly around

00:19:46
the world, shipping became something that was very affordable and what we kind of see is a complete

00:19:54
restructuring of the economy, this kind of reaching its high day in the 1980s. It was already going

00:20:01
on in the 60s and 70s, but by the 1980s what became obvious is that we are in a new situation,

00:20:09
which we'd call the new international division of labor with new kinds of geographies of production,

00:20:16
much more to the global east and far less centered on the old industrial areas in,

00:20:22
say, European and America, what we've been discussing last week. And we see that this new

00:20:30
centrality of cities need theorize. If cities are not the places where a lot of goods are produced

00:20:35
and hence where you get some kind of a trade surplus when you start trading these commodities,

00:20:40
say textiles, etc. with other places in the world. What is then the kind of source of power

00:20:46
that cities actually hold? And what John Friedman comes up with is a look to answer this question.

00:20:52
We have to look at how cities are actually being inserted. And indeed an urban system that is not

00:20:58
only national but a separate national is actually a global urban system. You have to understand it

00:21:04
And most in the 1970s, a lot of the tradition in urban geography was looking at urban systems

00:21:06
in a very nationalist way.

00:21:08
It was a methodological nationalism.

00:21:09
It was looking at Argentina.

00:21:13
You have Buenos Aires, which was the central city.

00:21:15
And then you had a number of smaller towns.

00:21:18
But there was a huge concentration there.

00:21:24
And it left to some blind spot, as to what actually the position of these cities were

00:21:28
and processes that went beyond national economies.

00:21:31
And as these processes became ever more prominent,

00:21:34
it requested a huge--

00:21:37
you could say conceptual innovation that started

00:21:40
to emerge in 1970s and it is hence

00:21:44
the importance of freedom theorizing, conceptualizing

00:21:46
about world city.

00:21:51
So a global urban system and the kind of main underlying

00:21:52
hypothesis-- sorry, yes.

00:22:02
So the last part, what I was saying is that you have processes of globalization, which means

00:22:09
that the way that urban geographers were looking at urban systems, the king obsolete

00:22:10
in one way or another.

00:22:17
They were mostly linked to how economies were functioning at the national scale, looking

00:22:21
into, could say, where productivity is located, how could we

00:22:24
get flows organized, how capital flows, etc.

00:22:33
But as an increased share of the economy became, you could say, international or transnational.

00:22:37
Yes, the first thing that needed to happen was some kind of a conceptual framework or apparatus

00:22:41
that allowed to understand centrality at a different level.

00:22:45
But differently, instead of talking about national urban systems, people started talking

00:22:52
about global urban systems. But looking at centralities. So what

00:22:58
freedom kind of started to argue also on the basis of his reading of David

00:23:03
Harvey in 1970's Ammano Acastels is that we can only understand what goes on in

00:23:07
cities if we relate that to the position of these places in this global

00:23:11
urban system. So it's the kind of their function that they take in the global

00:23:15
economy or rather in this global urban system that will have to explain

00:23:23
what we find in certain places. Turn around on the other side of that corn is that this global

00:23:29
urban system or this global economy can also be embarked explained through what is going on in

00:23:35
P global cities or in this case world cities. We use the terminology. So, it's the processes that

00:23:40
emerge and are steered and controlled from these places that will have an impact on them.

00:23:45
larger macro processes in the global economy.

00:23:48
So that's kind of this dialectic global system,

00:23:52
macro level urban system world cities,

00:23:56
and they're kind of co-productive or co-constitative.

00:24:02
So one of the main excerpts are key observed excerpts there

00:24:05
from his world to the hypothesis, which is kind of very point

00:24:08
is key cities throughout the world are used

00:24:10
by global capital as basing points

00:24:12
in the spatial organization and articulation

00:24:13
of production and markets.

00:24:17
The resulting linkages make it possible to arrange a world

00:24:19
cities into a complex spatial hierarchy.

00:24:25
So it's about appreciating how indeed capital is--

00:24:28
and its actors--

00:24:32
is kind of basing itself in cities as they organize

00:24:37
global production and commercial activities.

00:24:39
So that was kind of the main focus.

00:24:42
And if we understand that, we will start explaining

00:24:46
why certain places are important and others less,

00:24:50
and why some cities are dependent on this process,

00:24:53
and why others are actually powerful.

00:24:59
So yeah, as I said, it's a period of view economic restructuring.

00:25:03
The laws of a lot of functions that were typically taking place

00:25:06
in cities, and I mean, John Friedman was writing

00:25:12
from Los Angeles, which was a very production-centered town

00:25:13
or city.

00:25:15
And it was losing functions.

00:25:18
What he observed was still a huge concentration

00:25:24
of skyscrapers, portraits, head porches.

00:25:27
But production had long left.

00:25:30
So this kind of conundrum was how do we explain that?

00:25:32
How do we make sense?

00:25:35
And indeed, as I've been explaining,

00:25:39
you had as the new international division of labor activities

00:25:44
that were being off-short to other parts of the globe.

00:25:48
And the emergence of a new set of enterprises, corporations,

00:25:52
multinational corporations, if you could say,

00:25:54
an American firm would be globalizing

00:25:58
or multinational corporations where it was actually kind of hard

00:26:00
to still identify to what extent

00:26:01
they were still connected with some territory.

00:26:03
Yes?

00:26:08
Let me say that the production activity has low left.

00:26:11
What is the expectation of these production activities?

00:26:15
I mean, it was the question when I was reading the text.

00:26:18
Yeah, I mean, obviously it would depend on the city

00:26:22
that we're talking about, but think about what happens

00:26:25
in cities like Brussels, I mean textile industry,

00:26:30
all kinds of production facilities for consumer goods

00:26:32
that were initially

00:26:35
I mean, think about washing machines,

00:26:38
in editing that you use in the kitchen.

00:26:43
These were typically produced in the post-door era

00:26:47
in, you could say, the high income industrialized countries.

00:26:51
But because there was, you could say, pressure on the profitability

00:26:55
of these activities, because the wages were rather high.

00:26:59
These activities were offshore by a national,

00:27:02
emotional and not in national corporations.

00:27:06
And one of the main motivations was the search

00:27:08
for lower wages.

00:27:13
Or you could say, let's regulate labor markets

00:27:17
than what was occurring in the traditional industrial areas.

00:27:18
Yes?

00:27:20
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:22
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:24
You make other countries, others.

00:27:28
and this bill is in just one thing,

00:27:31
all the other firms are the big things.

00:27:36
So, so they need to be for a different experience

00:27:39
and moving everything in the world

00:27:42
to have kind of summer.

00:27:44
Yes, yeah, indeed.

00:27:47
I mean, and sometimes a little bit of confusion there

00:27:50
because people sometimes say, okay,

00:27:54
the industrial activities shifted to the periphery.

00:27:55
So I think in the first instance,

00:27:57
it's the initial periphery of the city.

00:27:59
I mean, the volume is suburbs.

00:28:02
But I think even, and it had something to do with,

00:28:03
you can say more,

00:28:06
the urban geographies, the land trends,

00:28:08
the ground prices in cities,

00:28:11
because it's, I mean, in large surfaces.

00:28:14
And it's easier to organize the rifries,

00:28:16
but at the later stage, they would basically,

00:28:19
I mean, these activities were either cut

00:28:21
because of investment and technology

00:28:23
and because you needed less jobs.

00:28:30
to make the same products and for there were shifted to other places around the globe.

00:28:34
So this is kind of what started to occur.

00:28:38
I mean some people even in some industries it was already in the 1950s.

00:28:41
This didn't happen over a day.

00:28:49
But it culminated if you were in the 70s and then the early 80s, which was a period of crisis in a lot of cities.

00:28:53
So, yeah, this new type of corporate,

00:28:55
actable to national corporations,

00:28:57
transnational corporations,

00:29:00
and how they organize global production networks.

00:29:02
So, a production network that used to be

00:29:04
kind of regionalized,

00:29:07
or nationalized in one way or another,

00:29:09
relied on local suppliers,

00:29:10
ended up being global.

00:29:15
I mean, if you have tried to order a bike in the past one year,

00:29:17
you know what it means to depend on

00:29:25
global supply chains or production networks, it's just an intensely fine-tuned process.

00:29:31
If anything goes wrong, I don't know, a tanker blocking the Suez Canal or something.

00:29:37
It's a precarious situation, but that's the kind of reality global supply chains.

00:29:42
And it's a part of the economy that's extremely dominated by these multinational corporations.

00:29:47
just some figures. I mean, there's a timeline there in 1960, there's about 66 billion.

00:29:54
What was kind of foreign direct investment, sort of for the technical terms here, but it means

00:30:01
direct investment in setting up factories. So you build a plant somewhere else,

00:30:07
so like Mercedes-Benz builds a plant in Korea or something, I'm not sure if they did.

00:30:12
are two-yota builds of plans in Texas.

00:30:14
In this kind of foreign direct investment logic,

00:30:16
M, it boom basically.

00:30:19
And you look at the figure of the 2016,

00:30:21
I could update that, I should probably do that.

00:30:23
About the third of the global economy

00:30:27
is actually equivalent to these,

00:30:29
and the I think, yes.

00:30:34
Foreign direct investment.

00:30:35
It's not too important,

00:30:38
but you just have to understand

00:30:41
that this is a measure of transnational flows.

00:30:45
So it's a measure of what part of the economy

00:30:50
is not local but is actually global or transnational.

00:30:54
And it relates to the investment activities

00:31:00
while large corporations to set up greenfield investments

00:31:01
as a skull.

00:31:05
So imagine a greenfield where you put into factory

00:31:13
those such as Brownfield redevelopment, which is an ex-site, which is then a refurbished

00:31:15
or one way or another.

00:31:19
Okay, so these are those kind of activities.

00:31:26
So 90% of this global economy of this FDI is concentrated in these multinational corporations

00:31:29
and slowly getting to my point here.

00:31:35
This is also why John Freeman was looking at multinational corporations and their geographies

00:31:39
to identify and conceptualize world cities.

00:31:40
So for jump treatment,

00:31:44
treatment at the cities where a lot of these headquarters

00:31:48
by these international corporations were located,

00:31:51
were, I mean, those were those cities

00:31:53
that they identified as world cities.

00:31:57
So since they saw important in the global ecosystem.

00:31:58
Okay.

00:32:02
So as he says, world cities are then to be sites

00:32:04
for command and control.

00:32:06
And he really saw these corporate headquarters

00:32:10
as the place is that controls and command it

00:32:13
in various ways, either to governance systems

00:32:17
by decision making, by the internal structure,

00:32:21
how global production was being organized.

00:32:23
And his kind of methodological hypothesis

00:32:29
was if we map these headquarter geographies,

00:32:33
we will actually be able to map the global urban system.

00:32:40
And we'll also understand the relation between different kind of cities as to who controls

00:32:41
what.

00:32:45
So it's a way to look at the power in this global urban network.

00:32:50
Some places are more dominant, hold more command and control functions than others.

00:32:51
Okay.

00:32:57
So I then came up with this map or cartogram or whatever you want to call it.

00:33:02
And yeah, it's certainly dated because Soviet Union is still on there and it's not

00:33:07
not part of this figure, which is also debatable.

00:33:11
Maybe there were not, I mean, say,

00:33:14
your American corporate headquarters there,

00:33:16
but for sure there were links,

00:33:21
even with the Soviet Union and capitalist countries, for sure.

00:33:25
But the whole point is that what Friedman actually does here

00:33:30
is translate the critical tradition of world systems theory,

00:33:34
which is a way to explain uneven development

00:33:37
in the global economy to an urban framework.

00:33:41
So it identifies three kind of areas, globalization,

00:33:44
arenas, if you will, one centered on Asia,

00:33:47
one on North America, one on Western Europe.

00:33:50
And typically, it finds a power balance

00:33:55
where you have powerful cities with a lot of corporate headquarters

00:33:58
in, you could say, the northern part of the hemisphere

00:34:01
and more, you could say, subordinate roles

00:34:03
for countries in the global south.

00:34:06
So when you, for instance, look at Northern America,

00:34:09
you have Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York,

00:34:13
which are identified as core cities with a lot of headquarters.

00:34:16
And they're kind of organizational networks

00:34:19
stretch to the global periphery.

00:34:21
So there's connections with the Rio de Janeiro, for instance,

00:34:23
Buenos Aires.

00:34:26
And these are kind of semi peripheral cities

00:34:30
who also hold command and control functions

00:34:34
and headquarters, they're oriented towards these centers

00:34:38
in the global north, could be that there are subsidiaries

00:34:41
of large corporations that are organized in such a concept.

00:34:45
So it's a way to explain how power is distributed

00:34:47
in this global urban system, and also starts

00:34:52
to explain why perhaps some places benefit more

00:34:55
from this integration in the global urban system than others.

00:35:00
So it would probably lead to an accumulation of wealth

00:35:03
in cities in the global north, to some extent,

00:35:06
also in the Senate periphery, think about Rio de Janeiro.

00:35:08
But at the same time, it would also work

00:35:12
as some kind of a funnel of siphon

00:35:16
off a siphon actually of surface toward the global north.

00:35:21
For instance, a US corporation producing stuff

00:35:27
energy, data, in part there will be benefits locally but at the same time there will also

00:35:32
be an extraction of surface value to the global market.

00:35:38
So it's also a way to understand, believe in this global economy.

00:35:44
I know it's a lot, sometimes a lot of economic terms but just to give you an idea, a

00:35:49
restructured global economy and the imaginary of a global urban system and city-staking

00:35:56
and different role in that on the basis of their command and control functions which

00:36:03
frequently defines as headquarters functions. So that's world cities. World cities,

00:36:09
corporate headquarters, command and control. I'm just giving you a number of key concepts there.

00:36:15
A second way of theorizing it is, and that's why I also have the other texts,

00:36:21
I could have given you the entire book, the Global City, but it would have taken you a week,

00:36:26
probably, or at least a few days to actually read it. It's still in flight to Dusso, but it's a kind of

00:36:34
shorter kind of version of the argument, which kind of explains what centrality is to

00:36:40
Saskia Susson. Okay, but I'll give you a bit more context by referring also to her book,

00:36:44
the global city. So one of, you could say, what has been

00:36:48
argued to be one of the seminal pieces talking about cities in

00:36:52
globalization, it starts kind of from the same rooms as

00:36:56
Richmond. I mean, it had been a very intense conversation in

00:37:00
the 1980s about what is going on with cities, they have

00:37:03
shifting functions, they're faced with the industrialization,

00:37:08
etc. There's also fiscal crisis of the local state. A lot of

00:37:12
cities were in trouble if you saw the movie.

00:37:14
Pixie Driver with the young Robert Teneiro,

00:37:20
he's driving around the relaxed New York in a city

00:37:21
neighborhoods are in trouble.

00:37:23
There's a lot of blight.

00:37:26
So cities were struggling to think about what

00:37:30
our functions could be and what is going on, especially

00:37:34
in 1970s, is a complete restructuring of these urban

00:37:35
economies.

00:37:38
So for Susson, it's less only about, you could say,

00:37:41
new command and control function about headquarters.

00:37:44
She looks at the complete restructuring of urban economies

00:37:46
from, you could say, manufacturing jobs

00:37:48
to service economies.

00:37:54
So we already saw that the majority of economic activities

00:37:56
in metropolitan areas are services.

00:38:01
But she particularly focuses on a particular subset

00:38:06
of these services, which equals advanced producer services.

00:38:08
So in the coming months, you will probably

00:38:11
start to hate the notion of advanced producer

00:38:15
services or being treated by it.

00:38:16
But it's a kind of--

00:38:18
I mean, you probably never heard about it.

00:38:21
A night of the day I, before I ever read about it.

00:38:27
But it tells it's kind of trying to capture those very

00:38:30
sophisticated, if you will, professional services

00:38:33
and service inputs for other firms.

00:38:37
So in themselves, they don't really produce much.

00:38:39
But still, their input is very important

00:38:41
for other corporations.

00:38:43
Think about financial services,

00:38:47
law, management, consultancy, accounting,

00:38:50
and auditing, advertising, et cetera, et cetera.

00:38:53
So these are not really producing things

00:38:57
that you can buy and consume at some point.

00:39:01
This is actually very knowledge intensive,

00:39:05
sometimes it's also called knowledge intensive business services,

00:39:08
which are kind of consumed as the art produced.

00:39:13
So legal advice is kind of produced in face-to-face meetings.

00:39:19
Think about a corporation that wants to set up a shop

00:39:24
or a plant or an investment in China, a European firm.

00:39:41
Probably you want to check, I think we are too, with a large international law firm that can give you a lot of experience as to what the regulations are for investment and other China.

00:39:44
you would need dedicated financial services.

00:39:49
How do you finance your international expansion?

00:39:55
You would need the advice of auditing firms accounting firms

00:39:58
because probably you want to attract some further funding

00:40:01
by issuing, I don't know, stocks above,

00:40:02
or something like that.

00:40:06
So financial investors would want to look at your activities.

00:40:14
Advertising, yes, how are you going to sell your cookies, cars, et cetera in China?

00:40:20
You need to know something about the local market or local markets, the sensitivities.

00:40:25
So yeah, you may want to adapt your practices there.

00:40:32
You may need to advise of management consultants because you may say that you want to globalize, but how are you going to

00:40:35
manages process, what kind of responsibilities do you give

00:40:37
to your managers in China?

00:40:39
Then they have the autonomy to take decisions.

00:40:44
Will you work with the central command structure?

00:40:47
How will you think about the profitability

00:40:48
of your activities, et cetera?

00:40:53
I mean, it's not a course in business studies here,

00:40:56
but just imagine as a firm that you want to globalize,

00:41:00
there's a lot of things that enter into the picture.

00:41:04
And probably these kinds of inputs that you need

00:41:06
are so specialized,

00:41:10
does it make sense to start producing them yourself?

00:41:15
So you just buy very specialized inputs.

00:41:18
You get in touch with lawyers, consultants, et cetera.

00:41:21
They would fly in and charge the hell out of you

00:41:26
and then run off and maybe a direct advice was, okay.

00:41:30
So it shifts to the service economy.

00:41:35
but with the globalization of production and globalization of markets and financial markets,

00:41:39
we see that certain service firms are becoming increasingly important.

00:41:46
And these are these advanced producer services, services given to producing firms.

00:41:53
And what she says is, look, instead of looking at headquarters of corporations,

00:42:00
we best look not at the multinationals themselves, but we best look at where these APS

00:42:02
firms are located.

00:42:06
And it's not just that they have kind of cold control

00:42:08
over global productions, networks, as you could

00:42:11
imagine, corporate headquarters where

00:42:16
CEO with a big cigar takes a decision of slashing

00:42:20
10 jobs in Belgium or something.

00:42:25
It's more dilute, diluted form of control,

00:42:29
which he talks about, is more about control capabilities.

00:42:33
is the assemblage, or we could say,

00:42:37
in the entire mixture of these kind of service economies

00:42:40
that allows firms that use these services

00:42:43
to exert control of the global scale.

00:42:45
So multinational corporations that

00:42:48
have a long story to start short depends

00:42:51
on yet another set of players, advancement use the services

00:42:55
to actually be able to manage global production.

00:43:01
So that's kind of her reading, not just corporate headquarters, but look at these notes

00:43:05
of advanced producers.

00:43:10
And the second important element that she links to that and will talk more about that

00:43:17
next week, and because it's a slightly different topic, is that this APS economy, this high

00:43:24
and service economies, also is an important engine in producing polarization, the other kind

00:43:31
of process that could use polarized cities, but an important driver according to Susson

00:43:41
is the highly remunerated salary stop in these kind of activities and this will have an

00:43:48
effect on this city. So it produces an outcome where you have high and low skilled labor forces

00:43:51
in APS or around APS.

00:43:53
And at some point, it could also even

00:43:57
lead to what she calls the peripheralization of the core.

00:44:02
So there will be a drive also to boost informal labor

00:44:06
markets in parts of the local economy.

00:44:11
But we'll talk more about that next thing.

00:44:15
So that's her idea about global cities.

00:44:17
And in the end, global cities

00:44:22
a site for the production of specialized services needed by complex organizations for running

00:44:27
a spatially diverse dispersed network of factors offices and services out there.

00:44:31
The production of financial innovations and the making of markets both central to the

00:44:34
internationalization expansion of the financial industry.

00:44:39
So for Sussan it's both about and you're free to refer to Sussan because it rhymes

00:44:45
with lessons as other students have done so before and make movies about.

00:44:49
So it's both about global production networks but also the running of global financial

00:44:50
markets.

00:44:55
So it's not just the production of goods themselves but also connecting to the world of

00:44:59
finance to get investment in these production.

00:45:03
So that's what SARS-CoS-CoS-CoS is talking about.

00:45:10
And the paradox that she sees is that as there's a kind of a dispersion of activities

00:45:14
at the same time there's a growing need for concentration.

00:45:16
The more dispersed global production networks,

00:45:18
the common financial markets,

00:45:21
the more the need for centralized control

00:45:23
or control capabilities over these markets.

00:45:27
So that's kind of the paradox of cities,

00:45:30
despite the internet, et cetera,

00:45:33
or virtualization of activities,

00:45:37
there's a continued role for face-to-face interaction

00:45:40
and interpretation in limited set of cities.

00:45:46
So why are APS located in a limited number of cities?

00:45:49
Well, she talks about different kinds of thought dependence.

00:45:53
So it means that one situation establishes itself

00:45:58
is kind of the whole kinds of self-reinforcing mechanisms.

00:46:03
So if there's a concentration, there's a deep market

00:46:04
and services.

00:46:06
So if you go to London, for instance, you're

00:46:09
quite sure that you will find everything.

00:46:12
If you have these kind of services,

00:46:14
some kind of a labor market culture

00:46:16
where we'll emerge around that.

00:46:19
You'll find a specialized labor there.

00:46:24
And yeah, in a lot of world and global cities think about New York

00:46:26
or London, some kind of a Yup culture,

00:46:28
young urban professional culture,

00:46:32
has emerged within these kinds of APS firms.

00:46:36
There's also a lot of synergies between these firms

00:46:38
and I'll tell you a little bit more about that.

00:46:42
So also these different KBS firms work together

00:46:46
as they service their clients.

00:46:50
And what is even more striking is that these APS firms

00:46:54
in and of themselves also become global corporations.

00:46:58
So they also set up international networks

00:47:00
either to follow their clients

00:47:05
or to remain credible as a global, as a vehicle act.

00:47:12
So a number of reasons why this kind of geography reproduces itself and is increasingly anchored

00:47:16
in a number and a limited number of global cities.

00:47:24
So my barracks, for my dear colleague from the Metu-Yehan Kickingen, who did a kind of

00:47:28
nice set of maps on law firms and Brussels.

00:47:33
It's kind of interesting to see that the concentration in global cities, you could say,

00:47:37
when at the more abstract level also translate into clusters

00:47:39
at the metropolitan level.

00:47:41
And that tells us something about, you can say,

00:47:44
the more micro-sociologies and geographies

00:47:46
of these kind of professional serves.

00:47:50
So what you see is on the left-hand side, the law firms.

00:47:55
The big picture of foreign law firms, the smaller insect

00:48:00
map is Belt and Ferns, the number of commonalities

00:48:07
avenue in these which is kind of center of a very rich neighborhoods or set of neighborhoods

00:48:11
and some Brussels as a location of boats. I think Belgian,

00:48:18
a group of people. I love from the local garden offer. What is foreign law firms or what

00:48:25
is special? For the foreign law firms they're very much concentrated around the EU district.

00:48:27
Okay, so a lot of activities

00:48:31
I'd have something to do with the client or clients

00:48:33
that are located there, which is either directly

00:48:38
European Commission or firms that want to not be

00:48:43
European Commission.

00:48:46
And this is kind of a process that we'll talk a bit more

00:48:51
when we do the tour and Brussels in the end of next week.

00:48:55
So micro geographies are also produced micro clusters

00:48:57
produced at the urban level.

00:49:00
The same is Vincent Stu in London.

00:49:04
Some great work by Cook at all.

00:49:06
Not Captain Cook, but another cook.

00:49:09
So we cook top this figure.

00:49:10
Obviously what you see there is a city of London,

00:49:14
which is also a very particular jurisdiction

00:49:15
in and of itself.

00:49:18
It has some kind of an exceptional room

00:49:21
that doesn't follow the regulations of, you could say,

00:49:25
the continent in this case of the UK and enough itself.

00:49:26
It's governed in a very weird way.

00:49:29
I never recall how exactly.

00:49:32
I don't know if you can make sure that the bridge is themselves.

00:49:34
But it's kind of a self-port,

00:49:37
I mean, the self-regulate itself,

00:49:43
governed jurisdiction on the island,

00:49:49
where corporations also have a large say in.

00:49:54
So within the limits of the long run, you find particular regulations there.

00:49:56
That's why the stock exchanges located there.

00:49:59
And all the financial institutions are located around.

00:50:03
And then besides that, the specialized district, the legal district, etc.

00:50:08
So the tendency of seeking proximity is also evident there.

00:50:15
A bit more on this, because of ABS complex, as I said, these firms also

00:50:23
interacted one another. So this is some work we did in Brussels. We took a corporate survey

00:50:31
aimed at APS professionals so we sent the survey around with with legal experts, expert,

00:50:37
ICT experts, etcetera, bankers and they kind of listed how they interacted with other APS firms

00:50:44
either in their daily practice for themselves or as they were giving service to their customs.

00:50:51
Okay, and what you find is actually quite a bit of interaction with sector itself.

00:50:56
And also particularly between sectors in law and finance, law,

00:50:59
accounts, and law, and accounts in financial services.

00:51:09
So just imagine as a corporation, what often happens is that when you issue some kind of financial

00:51:13
of product, think about a share or something

00:51:15
or you want to go for a loan.

00:51:18
Namely the financial institution, we need a law firm.

00:51:22
That needs to kind of come up with the prospectus

00:51:27
or check the prospectus that is made by financial institutions,

00:51:31
auditors and accountants that have a look at it.

00:51:36
So this is a kind of connected thing to financial markets.

00:51:38
What we also found is quite some interaction

00:51:40
between ICT and financial services.

00:51:42
This has something to do with,

00:51:44
you can say the virtualization of finance

00:51:46
that is currently going on.

00:51:49
So quite a bit of interdependencies

00:51:52
between different sectors will also explain

00:51:54
why does a need for proximity?

00:51:55
Yes, that's a question.

00:52:00
That's a very good question.

00:52:05
What do I remember from these percentages?

00:52:08
I think, all right.

00:52:12
So I think that it's standardized to the,

00:52:13
you could say the largest link.

00:52:16
So we looked at, you could say the intensity of interactions.

00:52:19
And we found that within financial services,

00:52:20
this has the strongest link.

00:52:23
So it's a relative scale.

00:52:24
So that's the strongest link.

00:52:27
It's 100%.

00:52:29
And then when you for instance look at the duration

00:52:32
between law and financial services,

00:52:37
the strength of the time between law and finance is only half of the kind of relations

00:52:39
within the finance itself.

00:52:45
It was measured in a different way.

00:52:48
It's measured by frequency.

00:52:58
So on a regular basis, how much do you hire advice in, you could say, "No, it's

00:53:01
or et cetera.

00:53:04
But there's other ways of measuring that for sure.

00:53:07
So it's one way of doing that.

00:53:12
So yes, this kind of gravitational pull towards other actors

00:53:15
in this APS complex explains kind of the reproduction

00:53:17
of global cities.

00:53:20
And another one was indeed this globalization

00:53:23
of strategies of APS firms themselves.

00:53:26
So they're both clustered and they're

00:53:30
globalized at the same time, deloed--

00:53:34
well, I mean, it's part of its branding process.

00:53:36
HSBC is the same thing.

00:53:39
So it's playing on both being global and tapping

00:53:41
into local knowledge.

00:53:43
You may think about that what we want,

00:53:46
but it's certainly part of their corporate strategy,

00:53:51
the geographical strategy, et cetera.

00:53:52
Yes?

00:53:52
OK.

00:53:54
I think that's the public early days,

00:53:56
but I think that's what we have all about,

00:54:00
how open and forward to performance

00:54:02
that's been happening.

00:54:06
No, I was taking care of my children.

00:54:09
But I think that's a good point.

00:54:14
I mean, I think for sure, there has been a tremendous impact

00:54:15
on business travel.

00:54:20
But it's also kind of a long discussion

00:54:22
as to what extent you need business travel

00:54:25
these are the video conferencing and all the kinds of things.

00:54:30
So there's already quite a bit of research in there.

00:54:34
There's also, you can say, more ethnographic approaches

00:54:38
that are kind of questioning the actual day-to-day

00:54:40
relevance of having a global network.

00:54:43
But definitely, artists offices really being used,

00:54:46
or I think they need there to have an address

00:54:47
and populate websites.

00:54:51
And then you may actually find that it's much more

00:54:54
concentrated within a number of global cities

00:54:57
despite having a very global network.

00:55:00
And it could be other ways of organizing yourself.

00:55:04
I haven't done very clusters or meetings or conferences

00:55:05
to make things work.

00:55:08
That there's also, and we'll read a bit about that,

00:55:12
practice of the governments of people that are based

00:55:15
in London, that are then two years based in Singapore.

00:55:18
So there are a lot of kind of strategies.

00:55:24
But yeah, the main kind of question in the DB is COVID.

00:55:30
Now the final proof that there's an end to the city,

00:55:32
I think that's hugely overblown.

00:55:35
And I think there's quite a bit of reasons

00:55:39
about the knowledge and density of certain practices

00:55:42
that explains why face-to-face interaction will prevail.

00:55:46
Just as when you think about teaching,

00:55:50
There's hopefully some added value to face the face teaching

00:55:53
overlooking at a screen.

00:55:55
And it has something to do with the interpretation

00:55:58
of information and is being shared about how

00:56:00
grounding processes work.

00:56:04
We think the same about certain concepts, et cetera.

00:56:07
And if you don't do this face-to-face,

00:56:12
you just miss out on this micro feedback loop.

00:56:15
If this would be online, I wouldn't see

00:56:19
nodding or frowning, so I would be in trouble sometimes.

00:56:25
But I think it's clearly, it's a very important question.

00:56:28
There will probably be a more strategic use of these sites,

00:56:31
and there will also be a more selective use

00:56:34
of face inflection, which would, I'm ultimately also

00:56:39
input, input, APS activities, and your geographies.

00:56:44
But it won't do a dissolution, I think, personally.

00:56:47
I see no theoretical reasons why that should be obsolete.

00:56:52
But it's research that could be done.

00:56:57
I mean, there's a whole class of people, digital nomads.

00:57:02
These are more, you could say, self-employed.

00:57:05
They don't depend on other inputs.

00:57:07
And their production process think about setting up

00:57:08
a website or something.

00:57:11
You can just go to Bali and do that from there.

00:57:15
But even there you see the emergence of temporary clusters,

00:57:19
other digital nomads that are in Bali,

00:57:22
discuss stuff, et cetera, et cetera.

00:57:27
So I think even there is a social aspect to that.

00:57:30
And you get the return of centrality,

00:57:32
even where you don't expect it.

00:57:36
And it seems to be something that is related to the fact

00:57:39
that we're talking about cognitive cultural capitalism.

00:57:45
And that's an excellent bridge to what Alan Scott is talking about

00:57:48
in his version of Global Siki regions.

00:57:51
So we talked about world cities, or the headquarters

00:57:54
Susson talks about global cities.

00:57:56
You look into a wider complex of these advanced services

00:57:59
that sit around corporations.

00:58:05
And then Alan Scott says, well, you and your world

00:58:08
and global cities have to explain something like this,

00:58:14
which is a much larger coloration, which is urban to some extent,

00:58:17
which depends here on San Francisco,

00:58:19
and it's easy to notice.

00:58:24
But how do you make sense of this wider San Francisco Bay area

00:58:26
with a lot of, you could say, centrality,

00:58:29
but it's not necessarily connected

00:58:31
to core metropolitan areas.

00:58:32
So what kind of--

00:58:34
and Scott is talking about it says, yes,

00:58:38
very nice that we talk about this classic.

00:58:43
world and global cities when you look for South Africa, South Asia, South Asia,

00:58:49
North New York, London, Tokyo, later on Chicago, and meet metropolitan areas.

00:58:53
But there's other kind of structures, morphological structures,

00:59:03
polycentric regions that do not necessarily fit the definition that South

00:59:07
assassin or John Friedman is talking about. And it also links a little bit to what we discussed

00:59:15
last week. How the city looks like or where the urban is can actually spill over metropolitan

00:59:24
areas. Okay. So clearly places like Silicon Valley. They're not dependent on the poor urban area

00:59:32
per se, but they're also kind of an example of the need for proximity in high-end advanced

00:59:43
sectors. So what our consensus is that, yes, something is right, but the kind of wider

00:59:49
process that is going on is a process towards centrality in knowledge-intensive

00:59:56
activities. And this pertains to APS firms that are located and you can see the core

01:00:03
metropolitan areas, but it also applies to high-tech firms, the GAFAS platform corporations,

01:00:12
etc, etc, all these kind of innovations that came out of sort of conf

01:00:16
of the confederate since, or when you look at the per-refrigerate delta, which is a kind of much more

01:00:21
of all-centric production area in the southeast of China. It's also a form of centrality,

01:00:26
where you have some metropolitan areas or metropolitan course, but it also goes

01:00:33
beyond there. So what interests our Scott is more, yeah, this driver of centrality, built

01:00:40
APS themselves. And he says, look, this centrality that SARS-CoS-SUSAN finds is actually part and

01:00:48
part of a wider shift towards cognitive cultural captions. Right? So CCC and it means that

01:00:55
a lot of economic activities, crucially depends on knowledge inputs.

01:00:58
And types of knowledge that are not generic,

01:01:03
not standardized, that are not easily appreciable

01:01:05
at a distance.

01:01:08
No, you need interpretation, dialogue with clients,

01:01:11
dialogue with other colleagues to make

01:01:16
sense of what is going on, because it's a very complex matter.

01:01:18
need to make sense of the situation collectively,

01:01:22
and hence there's a drive for proximity there.

01:01:23
Okay?

01:01:28
And this applies to an increased part of the economy,

01:01:32
which also means that it's a goes way beyond

01:01:34
how it produces services.

01:01:39
So, and the spatial form it takes is one of global city regions.

01:01:40
So you have more,

01:01:41
pulling more frequency,

01:01:44
polycentric kind of structure.

01:01:47
And his kind of metagography, if you will,

01:01:50
is a world of global city regions,

01:01:52
that has kind of interconnection, interconnected

01:01:55
and blazer role in these global production

01:01:57
networks in global markets.

01:01:58
Yes.

01:02:00
Hi, can you really understand my news

01:02:04
about how we can from China to India or APS?

01:02:05
Yeah.

01:02:09
Because as I understand that, the [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:16
And this need is kind of connection to this ABS that are all this service has connected to.

01:02:23
Well, the point by Scott is that, yes, an ABS law firm's fund, etc.

01:02:27
There's a clear need for proximity to the reasons that we've been discussing,

01:02:31
but there's also a place to other parts of the economy.

01:02:37
Think about high-tech, think about education, you know, whatever.

01:02:41
And these are also prone to these agglomeration dynamics.

01:02:46
And that is because increasingly the production process

01:02:47
is knowledge intensive.

01:02:51
Just compared to, it's a 50 years ago,

01:02:53
it would have been a very standardized process

01:02:56
just make 1 cars per week.

01:03:00
This is becoming increasingly customized.

01:03:02
It's much more about prototyping,

01:03:06
it's much more about failure in particular cars.

01:03:07
I mean, I don't know anything about cars,

01:03:10
but I'm stuck with cars.

01:03:16
So it's much, much more just in time delivery,

01:03:19
it's much more tailored rather than mass production.

01:03:24
That used to be the case in the 50s, 60s, 70s,

01:03:25
and this has shifted.

01:03:28
Roughly in the 1980s,

01:03:31
where it was more about flexible production systems,

01:03:34
where you could say the connection with suppliers,

01:03:37
but also customers who are in the game much more important.

01:03:41
So it's a kind of broad scale restructuring of the economy.

01:03:43
So also explains why proximity matters,

01:03:46
not only in each of those that you serve,

01:03:48
but more broadly to the economy.

01:03:53
But I don't understand what drives this company

01:03:57
to gather instead of providing for example.

01:03:59
Okay, well, I have a whole lecture on that

01:04:01
and I can look at the lessons, right?

01:04:05
But I mean, and part of the story is you could say

01:04:08
the contemporary benefits of economic agglomeration,

01:04:11
which has something to do with what economic geographer

01:04:12
calls the externalities.

01:04:15
By being there, you get certain benefits

01:04:18
that you wouldn't get if you're not there,

01:04:21
stepping into high-scale labor,

01:04:23
high-scale labor, for instance,

01:04:25
and venture capitalists, et cetera, et cetera.

01:04:28
But there's a lot of what the whole part of the penancies as well.

01:04:31
And we do look at the story of Silicon Valley.

01:04:35
used to be a lot of government investment there.

01:04:38
Think US military and the semiconductor business

01:04:41
making chips and those kind of things

01:04:43
was huge funded by the federal government

01:04:49
in NASA, DARPA and all kind of ministerial defense.

01:04:50
And a lot of these innovations

01:04:54
were then later on commercialized by private players

01:04:58
who then used these technologies to build their own platforms.

01:05:02
And this great work by my Anna Madzukata, for instance,

01:05:05
through with great economists, says,

01:05:12
well, if you look at your iPad, almost every critical element

01:05:15
there piece of technology can be related back

01:05:18
to some kind of federal investment, et cetera, et cetera.

01:05:23
So which brings them to an argument about,

01:05:26
is it really private innovation that we're talking about,

01:05:29
or does it have something to do with the sustained investment

01:05:32
by public authorities in these kinds of investments?

01:05:35
The same is true for big pharma, for instance.

01:05:39
It's even first easy to come up with the new vaccines,

01:05:43
and these are then commercialized by Pfizer, et cetera.

01:05:46
So it's a very complex story, and no clear answer

01:05:48
is a field of its own.

01:05:53
But what we need to understand is that this proximity

01:05:57
and the centrality goes beyond cities themselves.

01:06:02
OK, so it's much more prevailing process.

01:06:05
But, Phil, I mean, the point being is that at some point

01:06:09
APS firms, even in these global city regions,

01:06:11
they would still have some kind of a role

01:06:16
to play as connectors, think about Silicon Valley firms

01:06:18
that come up with new technologies,

01:06:23
or that one can make a profit of these new innovations.

01:06:28
They would have to be kind of certified back then that their intellectual property would be

01:06:34
tetanus probably very likely that would be San Francisco based law firms that would then

01:06:35
specialize.

01:06:36
Okay.

01:06:37
Okay.

01:06:38
All right.

01:06:39
Yeah.

01:06:42
[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:51
Yeah.

01:06:55
Well, I mean, you now, this kind of--

01:06:56
these are the debates.

01:06:59
I'm just rehearsing the date of the 1980s, 90s.

01:07:01
Slow to get into the Northeast.

01:07:06
We'll move through that throughout the lecture.

01:07:11
But this mainly tries to capture what went on in the 1980s

01:07:14
and what was the starting point, if you will,

01:07:16
or the theorizing of world and global cities.

01:07:18
[INAUDIBLE]

01:07:33
Yeah.

01:07:36
Well, there, so the question is,

01:07:39
do I extend as the Rust Belt at Global City?

01:07:43
I don't think, I mean, it will.

01:07:47
Alice Scott would really see that as a global city region,

01:07:49
because it's mostly, you could say,

01:07:52
a remnants of an older process of industrialization,

01:07:55
which was much more focused on mass production.

01:07:59
So think about fact-reasoned Pittsburgh, Detroit,

01:08:00
et cetera, et cetera.

01:08:08
the Ford factory. And this was kind of in the history of the US. It was a kind of process

01:08:14
of industrialization that was finalizing again. But it's returning since the 60s, 70s.

01:08:20
And then you had a switch to the some belt states. A lot of production, especially in the

01:08:26
car industry, was taken over by Japanese investments. And a lot of states were the labor

01:08:38
writes were less protected. So I mean the difference would be to what it's

01:08:43
I mean it's just one example but a question would be to what extent Duke in

01:08:47
this day in age, knowledge and tactic, intensive production activities are

01:08:51
over at the state place in the Rust Belt, think to some extent this is the case

01:08:55
but it wouldn't be an leading example.

01:08:56
I don't want to be exclusive.

01:08:59
I think it could be visualized as such,

01:09:01
but it would be more of an empirical question

01:09:03
to what extent is actually taking place.

01:09:08
Whether it's just a morphology of old industrial area,

01:09:10
like the rural area,

01:09:13
or whether there's some kind of integrated region,

01:09:15
which you do see in Silicon Valley

01:09:18
because it's kind of organized about technology.

01:09:35
We could perhaps argue that it used to be a global city region of yesterday year, but perhaps the globalization was less advanced there and then or at least it would be with the different.

01:09:38
Okay, just to say there's different conceptualization,

01:09:43
that's why to capture function with also the morphology of these places.

01:09:48
I think it's something to reflect on and comparing where you get.

01:09:52
Yeah, I think in the interest of time,

01:09:57
I will have to move on because I'm using a lot of words.

01:10:00
I think it's important that things are clear.

01:10:04
Second of all, and I might speed up a little bit,

01:10:12
I want to give you a methodological example of how people actually dealt with this conceptual apparatus

01:10:20
of world and global cities and global city regions to measure these processes or empirically study these processes.

01:10:25
So this is the work by the globalization and world cities research network.

01:10:31
And it basically starts with whatever of questions I mean.

01:10:35
When you look at some of these claims,

01:10:38
I mean, it's one thing to say, yeah,

01:10:42
we have the acknowledge growth city formation process

01:10:44
of global city formation process,

01:10:47
or to say that interurban connections are already important.

01:10:50
And actually, when you start diving into this,

01:10:53
you quickly run into trouble.

01:10:57
And this is actually something that was kind of noted

01:11:01
already in the '90s, so a very long time ago,

01:11:06
but I want to give you the entire development of the agenda.

01:11:11
That is actually quite a few insight into world city network

01:11:12
information.

01:11:15
So we had a number of case studies in the '80s and '90s,

01:11:19
especially with Soskea Sosen, all particular set of cities,

01:11:21
long the New York et cetera, et cetera.

01:11:23
There was all kinds of hypotheses and claims

01:11:26
about the insertion in a global urban system.

01:11:30
But actually, invariably, there was very little insight

01:11:31
into this.

01:11:35
So what connects cities, how central was cities

01:11:36
in these urban systems?

01:11:42
It was kind of very much an ad hoc answer that you get

01:11:46
to the extent that generally short sets,

01:11:48
there's even a dirty little secret

01:11:50
in world cities research.

01:11:53
Actually, empirically, there's very little

01:11:55
on the actual connections being made between cities.

01:11:58
So we don't really know a lot about this.

01:12:02
And this is something that kind of a research gap

01:12:04
to use new liberals,

01:12:05
academic speak,

01:12:10
that globalization and world cities

01:12:12
with search networks should answer.

01:12:18
And there was a number of ways of trying to do with that.

01:12:24
People tried to work with secondary data in 1990s

01:12:28
of starting 1990s, thinking about for instance, yeah,

01:12:32
looking at the flows of airline passengers.

01:12:40
So how are cities connected by airlines?

01:12:44
And this is gave rise to these kind of hyperb

01:12:48
type of research that shares you.

01:12:53
It's a raw city network of the basis of airline flows.

01:12:57
Any idea whether this is a viable method.

01:13:01
And we measure the centrality of cities in the global economy

01:13:02
by using air life flows.

01:13:06
Well.

01:13:11
[INAUDIBLE]

01:13:12
All right.

01:13:21
[INAUDIBLE]

01:13:26
Yeah, so major airports are not necessarily in closed cities.

01:13:29
Yeah? Other ideas? Yeah?

01:13:39
I'm going to find any of that as well.

01:13:41
Oh, okay. Other kinds of sources to be used.

01:13:43
Okay. So the flow of bitcoins.

01:13:44
Okay. Yeah.

01:13:49
I mean, more particularly with these kind of data on airline flows, other ideas?

01:13:50
Yes.

01:13:54
This is also a commercial model for a company

01:13:57
where you hear, absolutely.

01:13:59
You're very, very bad at the department.

01:14:01
Absolutely, yeah, all right, yes.

01:14:04
(muffled speaking)

01:14:11
That's exactly the same.

01:14:13
I mean, it's debatable.

01:14:15
I mean, are you measuring economic importance

01:14:18
or are you measuring economic control?

01:14:18
Yeah.

01:14:26
[ Inaudible ]

01:14:30
>> Yeah, that was also the kind of, yeah, there's a hub and spoke system.

01:14:34
People write about papers flying where you don't want to go.

01:14:36
So it doesn't really connect.

01:14:38
I mean, there's a lot of people in the break.

01:14:42
Yeah, I think it's not necessarily to do anything there.

01:14:44
Yeah. And you'll write this.

01:14:51
[INAUDIBLE]

01:14:55
Yeah, yes, yes, absolutely.

01:14:55
Yeah, OK.

01:15:00
So I mean, at first sight, you can do something

01:15:03
because it's a kind of intuitive picture here,

01:15:06
especially when you look at the front top of the hierarchy.

01:15:11
So you find that New York and London is actually there.

01:15:14
But then you quite quickly go into all kinds of anomalies.

01:15:21
Yeah, these hub airports that are not necessarily relevant.

01:15:25
There is destinations which tell us something about economic importance,

01:15:30
but not necessarily about the importance in terms of controlling the global economy,

01:15:32
which is kind of a different kind of process.

01:15:40
Yeah, I was going to say something else about that, but it's, yeah, I forgot about it.

01:15:45
Yeah, so we can also think about new data collections.

01:15:49
And so your bitcoins is one brain.

01:15:51
And I want to pick your brain a little bit more on that.

01:15:55
But before that, I mean, just saying that one

01:15:58
of the big struggles in the 1990s that research

01:16:00
is where researchers work on front with.

01:16:01
And this is still the case today.

01:16:05
And you'll probably notice in some of your courses

01:16:08
is that a lot of the statistics are collected

01:16:11
at the state level and not necessarily

01:16:13
at the urban level.

01:16:17
And Peter Taylor, the by now emeritus professor

01:16:19
that founded the globalization and multidisciplinary

01:16:21
network always referred to this notion of state

01:16:22
districts.

01:16:26
It connected to statistics and indicators

01:16:28
that were collected by the national state

01:16:31
to measure the national economy, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:34
And at some point, the centrality of cities,

01:16:38
in economic process, has only creeped in slightly.

01:16:42
So we have sometimes at the national level

01:16:46
indicate about cities, but then intercity connections

01:16:48
and flows, it's very hard.

01:16:49
Think about trade flows, for instance,

01:16:51
(speaking in foreign language)

01:16:52
It's between national economies,

01:16:56
but if we have to assume them probably,

01:17:00
the major metropolitan areas will be more tight

01:17:01
in this growth and others.

01:17:02
Yes.

01:17:04
(mumbles)

01:17:06
But the previous slide,

01:17:07
in the beginning African-

01:17:10
[INAUDIBLE]

01:17:11
Sorry.

01:17:12
Yeah.

01:17:15
We have a lot of resource

01:17:19
extraction happening in these places.

01:17:21
No, but these--

01:17:23
I mean, it's always a question.

01:17:24
I will return to that.

01:17:28
The power of representation.

01:17:33
This is the result of where you cut off the list at some point.

01:17:35
So it's the most connected places

01:17:37
It's just a sense of passenger flows.

01:17:40
But there's another realizer on upgrading that.

01:17:42
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:43
Absolutely.

01:17:45
How do you get the rear screw?

01:17:49
Well, you can turn it around, and you can focus on Africa.

01:17:53
African cities and how they're connected in global, global

01:17:54
airline afterwards.

01:17:58
So you can do some kind of if you will, but not the analysis.

01:18:00
It's actually something that we did that look at the

01:18:03
evolution of African cities globally.

01:18:09
airline networks, and it could tell you, give you a hint about how these places are

01:18:15
according to nationalizing globalizing through their airline networks, which you can then

01:18:18
could still be a very rough figure.

01:18:24
And it would also, as we found, capture all kinds of processes, the liberalization of the

01:18:30
airline industry in Africa, rather than the increasing importance of some cities in the global

01:18:36
So yeah, just to give you an idea of what is the trouble when you start looking for

01:18:42
your kind of data, you perhaps can think a little bit about what other kinds of approximations

01:18:43
you could use.

01:18:50
And that was exactly kind of a conundrum or thing that people were chewing on in the 1990s

01:18:57
and as it became evident at some kind of new metajography was needed.

01:19:02
I'm using metagography in a sense that it refers to

01:19:04
associate spatial structure, if you will,

01:19:07
it helps to make sense of the world.

01:19:12
So it's a geography that explains how processes work.

01:19:16
Like the nation states tells us something

01:19:17
about what extent

01:19:24
either sectarian politics is able to territorialize,

01:19:34
need to make it difficult. Whereas perhaps the world city network tries to capture the

01:19:41
integrated fashion of economic processes. And this is actually what Manuel Castelles was

01:19:47
writing about in the 1990s when we were talking about this space of flows which he put into

01:19:53
opposition with the space of places. So he said, well, we have this traditional view of the world

01:20:01
as a mosaic of territorial states which are kind of yeah if you put them together you get the

01:20:09
world map but there's another kind of geography that is out there which is discontinuous so it's

01:20:15
kind of it's another continuous space these are kind of islands if you will that are connected

01:20:23
to flows of goods, people, money, knowledge etc etc so this is kind of character

01:20:25
rising the space of flow.

01:20:28
And it's kind of, it's a socialization process,

01:20:29
a sociologist.

01:20:34
So it's a society emerging on that.

01:20:38
And it was kind of kind of visionary.

01:20:41
But I, he intended to be visionary in a sense

01:20:42
that this would be the norm.

01:20:45
So we would be the common network society.

01:20:47
We can wonder about that.

01:20:50
But what is kind of still relevant, I think,

01:20:53
is that there's a tension between these spaces of flows.

01:20:56
So these islands of connected urban areas,

01:21:02
which is to some degree detached from a mosaic of city stance.

01:21:06
And there's all kinds of oppositions between that.

01:21:08
If you look at the election map in the UK,

01:21:10
none of the election map, the referendum map.

01:21:17
And you look at the leaf or remain float,

01:21:20
it was clear that London wanted to stay in,

01:21:23
which tells us something about the importance

01:21:25
of being remaining connected to,

01:21:27
we'd say other financial centers

01:21:29
on the European continent.

01:21:31
The rest of Britain, I mean, summarizing now,

01:21:34
was against that,

01:21:37
which shows that there's a disconnect in the daily lives

01:21:41
of people to the interest of a city.

01:21:46
I'm not saying that the leaf campaign

01:21:49
actually connected to the real needs of Brits,

01:21:50
but that's another kind of discussion, okay?

01:21:54
So this space of flows served as a kind of new metagogy

01:21:57
which then was an impetus to start collecting new data,

01:22:02
which ultimately brings me to the raw curiosity

01:22:05
and I'll try to be as brief as possible in the interest of time.

01:22:09
It's also not something that you need to...

01:22:11
No, you don't study this by heart,

01:22:16
but it's a way to kind of appreciate a certain methodology.

01:22:22
So just go to this website once, at least.

01:22:25
It's hosted by Lovedra University in East England

01:22:28
and then the Midlands.

01:22:34
It's a very interesting source for urban level case studies

01:22:37
on connectivity between cities.

01:22:39
It can also use for other courses, I think,

01:22:42
of the course by bus, for instance.

01:22:46
So it's quite an inventory of nice case

01:22:48
that is there.

01:22:50
So what's the starting point of this, you can say,

01:22:53
project by globalization and what's

01:22:58
the research network was, is let's take APS firms

01:23:05
as the clearest indicator species of this new space of flows.

01:23:07
So there's a new space of flows that

01:23:11
characterize how the global economy and global society works.

01:23:15
And as we read Castell's Sosen, it's very likely

01:23:18
that if we use these corporations,

01:23:23
we'll be able to indicate a command and control functions

01:23:24
of cities.

01:23:27
So the starting point are the geographies of APS firms

01:23:32
that tell us something about world and global cities.

01:23:34
The reason is, as I explained earlier,

01:23:37
these APS firms are in and of themselves.

01:23:41
International players, they have a global city geography,

01:23:44
if you will, so it makes sense to start looking

01:23:53
And the idea is that you can actually build a model on the basis of these APS

01:24:00
geographies and the model is based on the co-presence, the shared presence of

01:24:04
APS firms in multiple cities.

01:24:09
Summarized is one firm in Brussels and London.

01:24:14
It will make connection between these two cities and we can assume that it will

01:24:21
will be so kind of flow of probably emails, telephone calls, ideas, there will be

01:24:25
second-man's, people will travel between these officers, money will flow between

01:24:31
these officers, etc. So the shared presence of APS firm in multiple cities, so

01:24:36
one firm being located in multiple cities. So in a three-step spirit with any

01:24:41
model you need to specify it, then you can measure it, it's filling it to a data,

01:24:45
And then hopefully something comes out of this model.

01:24:46
Okay?

01:24:50
So, yeah, how does GOC solve it?

01:24:53
So, just as a random example,

01:24:56
a number of global or rural cities,

01:24:59
New York, London, Brussels, Kuala Lumpur,

01:25:05
and these are kind of contained spaces with a number of firms in there.

01:25:08
And these are APS firms.

01:25:11
And so there's the mobile, this thing, cities,

01:25:13
and they host APS firms.

01:25:16
Some of these firms are actually the same, okay?

01:25:21
So we have by now transformed corporations

01:25:23
such as Arthur Anderson, resident bank,

01:25:24
Kiffin Chan, the law firm,

01:25:27
Booth, Allen, Hamilton, noise,

01:25:28
that's insurance company.

01:25:30
But just to give you some questions.

01:25:33
So how is it specified?

01:25:34
What does God do?

01:25:37
It says, well, oh, there's a firm here

01:25:42
in London or Brussels, how important is this firm actually?

01:25:46
Okay, so you try to measure this in an objective,

01:25:49
or at least standardize way so that you make the same

01:25:52
per every time, or that you write every time.

01:25:55
So you say, okay, for this one office in Brussels

01:25:59
by Barclays or something or HSBC, a bank,

01:26:00
how important is it?

01:26:03
And we use a very standard scale, zero to five,

01:26:06
no offense are easy, you give it a zero.

01:26:10
Oh, it's the global headquarters, that is a fine, okay?

01:26:12
It's the only agency, but it would be, I don't know,

01:26:16
KBC or something like that, large belting back, okay?

01:26:19
And then there's a whole range in between.

01:26:21
A typical office would be two,

01:26:24
maybe a regional headquarters, and there's a lot of those

01:26:28
and Brussels that actually control European activities

01:26:31
would be a three or four.

01:26:34
So this is kind of the idea.

01:26:37
There's a hierarchy in office functions

01:26:40
and we can measure this in a standardized way.

01:26:43
If you have service values,

01:26:48
you can also imagine what the importance of the connection

01:26:50
between two offices would be.

01:26:54
So a very important office and Brussels,

01:26:56
and a very important office in London

01:27:01
would probably generate more traffic in terms of emails

01:27:04
some phone calls, which is then again a proxy

01:27:07
for, you could say, the importance of the activities

01:27:09
in global command language.

01:27:13
So it's basically calculating the intercity relation

01:27:18
the R value there by multiplying the service values.

01:27:21
And so very basic, so you have a very important time

01:27:24
is a very important one, if you are very strong relation

01:27:26
between these two places.

01:27:27
OK.

01:27:28
I'm going to get like that.

01:27:29
Can I imagine the connection?

01:27:33
So they took a line, the more important connection

01:27:36
between these kind of offices.

01:27:41
And you can populate a complete matrix with that.

01:27:44
You can do that in the filter until you drop that,

01:27:48
or you don't have the energy to look for more information

01:27:49
on office networks.

01:27:51
So this is kind of the basic one.

01:27:53
And it allows you to do, for instance,

01:27:57
this guy thinks that there's three cities in this very short list

01:27:59
New York Singapore and the app work.

01:28:02
And they have these different front

01:28:05
and it gets from ABC and D.

01:28:08
And we can could imagine a novel where you say, okay.

01:28:13
And for a global office in New York,

01:28:16
a very important office,

01:28:18
or a regular office in Singapore,

01:28:18
and a regular office in

01:28:23
and it would be a bit different for BC and D.

01:28:28
So just one example, I'll see there.

01:28:34
What you can then do is start to measure the connectivity

01:28:36
of cities.

01:28:40
Thus far we've been talking about first

01:28:43
and what the importance of the city has for a firm.

01:28:46
You can also think about what is now

01:28:49
the strength of a city's connection based

01:28:52
on the presence of first.

01:29:00
What you do is you basically summarize all these different types between cities for one

01:29:01
one six.

01:29:04
It sounds a bit complex but it's really easy.

01:29:10
So what you would do is think about the connection between different cities on the base

01:29:11
of the corporate networks.

01:29:19
So think about five times two plus five times two would be the connectivity generated

01:29:22
by first-grown, so you can be four times two.

01:29:25
Your, you'll be five times one.

01:29:29
And in this step, I think I was five.

01:29:33
And in some, you would get a figure of 40.

01:29:35
It's purely irrelevant example,

01:29:38
but it would give you the highest connectivity

01:29:41
in this model, right?

01:29:42
And then for the other kind of cities,

01:29:44
we could do similar exercises,

01:29:47
and for it would be generating

01:29:53
activities for a and even just a low presence on its front. But you would generate

01:29:59
someone activity for eight and for a. And also summarize that. And what you could

01:30:04
also do is express this as a proportion of most connected city in this tiny

01:30:10
example of New York. And you would get to say, well, enter is four times

01:30:15
connected as well as New York. So New York is is our leading

01:30:19
We'll sit here, then we have Singapore and then Andrew.

01:30:25
So a very, very small example to tell you how the structure is.

01:30:29
Service values, thinking about connections between cities,

01:30:31
and then summarizing these connections.

01:30:36
And that gives us an overall view of the connectivity of the city in the world,

01:30:39
sitting there.

01:30:42
So we have specified the model.

01:30:47
And then you can start measuring it and filling it with data.

01:30:52
And how has GOC done this?

01:30:56
Well, specification obviously refers to the APS firms.

01:31:01
And this kind of nice is that this measurement

01:31:04
has occurred several times since, I think, 2,

01:31:06
but every time in the same way.

01:31:09
So it kind of definitions of categories

01:31:13
of these kind of APS sectors has been in the same,

01:31:15
and has been numerous kind of reiterations

01:31:16
of these measures.

01:31:21
So five sectors are connected to SELSA's interpretation.

01:31:24
Can't see advertising, financial services, insurance,

01:31:26
law, management, and so forth.

01:31:31
Basically, what God does is the leading firms, 175 firms,

01:31:38
based on Forbes and other kinds of corporate lists,

01:31:44
that tells something about turnover, the size of these folks, et cetera, et cetera, are

01:31:47
kind of selected.

01:31:53
And then what is also done is, yeah, you could do this with an infinite number of cities.

01:31:56
Well, not infinite, but a very large list of cities.

01:32:03
But to avoid a bit of, I don't know, it's not biased, but to get a manageable data set,

01:32:08
You could say the largest cities or what we know from certain countries as economically

01:32:12
and important cities are selected in this list.

01:32:15
So it's not a purely inductive exercise.

01:32:20
It's kind of an informed decision to include some cities and other products.

01:32:27
So all the firms, a lot of cities, and then on the basis of information that we can find

01:32:36
on corporate websites, we made a decision as to how important offices are. And then you

01:32:44
can basically start filling the entire matrix. So just an example to share how this works.

01:32:49
I mean, you think about just look at the website, can be quite tough, but you can actually

01:32:56
hold all of these websites, find very detailed information at the address level of these

01:33:01
offices and all of these corporations are very proud that they're located in the

01:33:08
meeting world city is kind of a brand new so quite often you can fly down yes

01:33:15
yes you avoid the deforestation that's a very good idea

01:33:22
I think yeah I'm not sure whether it's going to take away all the noise that

01:33:30
that's what you're internet. So yeah, so it's a really accessible source of information,

01:33:38
but obviously it's also a bit of a guesswork and you need to come up with some kind of

01:33:46
interpretive guide to meet these websites and to make decisions as to how you will

01:33:55
give attached value to these phrases. Okay, just one, and then you can build these kind of

01:34:03
matrices. So all of them are all of countries, a lot of cities. And then you can start applying

01:34:08
that problem. Okay, so it's an approximation of the importance of cities in these corporate networks,

01:34:15
and it has the level of kind of sustained analysis or modeling of these interactions on that

01:34:24
basis. And then maybe already have seen these kind of maps. So a lot of world-saving network research

01:34:30
then start to look into the actual geographies that are being produced. So this is some research

01:34:40
from a while ago. It just shows the absolute levels of connectivity, so the global network connectivity,

01:34:48
and the darker pieces are the most connected places and then the lower the light colors by the

01:34:55
less one place. So it gives you an idea. Take a good look at this map. What you learn from that

01:35:09
or what you find striking anything striking here. Does it confirm what you thought? You learned

01:35:38
Can you think? Yeah? No? Yes? I don't really get a comment on the situation. I said, "If I do this, or if you do this, the word happens. There are not a few routines in this." So, where there's so many neuroships. If you think that you said that you can kind of think of the largest in these things, you do a piece of permanent largest in the number of populations.

01:35:39
I know.

01:35:40
No.

01:35:43
So, but it's a list.

01:35:45
So there's a number of criteria.

01:35:51
I mean, population is one, but it's also in certain countries.

01:35:56
I mean, it's also looking for its business, its written down economic importance.

01:36:04
So in Belgium, it would also include these entities, which is absolutely not a two million

01:36:09
in happen in the city so but we know it has important opportunities.

01:36:13
Now just to be clear, these are not 525 cities,

01:36:16
but it's a selection I think it's 123.

01:36:20
So it's focusing on the most important cities,

01:36:24
which as a result, apparently gifts,

01:36:27
a geography that is skewed towards,

01:36:29
it's a Northern America Western Europe

01:36:32
and then has a bit of presence elsewhere.

01:36:45
>> Yeah. >> I'm just thinking, like, this thing is like, about 50, just, yeah, I think, like, it's like that.

01:36:50
Like, it's like a whole life, like, you know, in relationship that a global that type of business.

01:36:51
Like, I don't know if you have a good case. >> Yeah, absolutely.

01:36:55
>> You know, that's a good case. >> For making sense, you know, which I found in a bit,

01:36:59
a lot lower probably not, but the money, but like, how many people, you know,

01:37:07
>> I agree 300%.

01:37:13
So the question is, does this represent cities and globalization or does it represent

01:37:17
the location strategies of APS first?

01:37:20
And to what extent is this the same?

01:37:24
So the question is to what extent do you go along and

01:37:30
claim that it gets from foreign indicators species of commandment control. I think to some extent

01:37:35
this is the case but there's clearly other processes but I think and that's something that we'll

01:37:43
return to later on. We have to I think another key distinguish between say more economic drug

01:37:48
a few readings whereas there's also more urban studies critiques some people say that you're not

01:37:53
capturing globalization here. And this whole process we should look at?

01:37:58
Yes, that's true. But it doesn't discredit one particular reading or one particular focus on the

01:38:03
process, as long as we're clear about what it is that measures and what it is it has. But I

01:38:09
completely example that remitances, I'll return to that in a second, is very appropriate.

01:38:16
So this we have to be careful that we were not switched to some kind of imperial

01:38:24
act here to try to claim that one process dominates something, but it was a specific

01:38:33
equation. Same here is the same period that's a kind of comparison between two periods in time.

01:38:40
I mean there was a data collection that allows analysis in 2000 and I'm just before the crisis

01:38:45
in 2008, I mean the previous crisis, we get them all.

01:38:50
So comparing the structure of the world city network,

01:38:52
which is effectively on the aggregate level,

01:38:58
the structure of corporate strategies and the interpretive fees.

01:39:02
And I mean it's kind of interesting to see that even before

01:39:06
the Euro-American or North Atlantic financial crisis,

01:39:09
there was already a shift going on in terms of strategic importance

01:39:14
of cities in the east, and I mean both in eastern Europe,

01:39:18
and the global east, so I'm talking about Chinese cities,

01:39:23
for instance, so if regions were interested in secular shifts

01:39:25
within the structure of the world economy,

01:39:29
it shows that it's also reflected in the corporate geographies

01:39:34
of these ATS firms, which knowing that they're

01:39:37
important inputs for global corporations

01:39:40
There's something about developments on these cities

01:39:44
in how capital circulates on the global scale.

01:39:46
So it tells us something that everything,

01:39:52
and that's also why Rob uses heuristic.

01:39:54
And there's some modesty connected to that.

01:39:56
Heuristic is a kind of a starting point.

01:39:59
As a searching device, where he's like,

01:40:04
oh, what the hell is going on in, let's say, lightly?

01:40:06
It's dark reds.

01:40:08
What could be the process going on?

01:40:12
How does it explain that-- how do you explain that it's

01:40:15
one of the worst performers, if you will,

01:40:16
and it was so much connectivity,

01:40:18
whereas it's a very important transit

01:40:23
hub between that in America and a northern America?

01:40:26
Is why is it losing its functions?

01:40:29
Is it because Latin America is becoming

01:40:35
less important for northern American capital?

01:40:36
what could be going on there?

01:40:39
I mean, you can think about numerous other examples there.

01:40:41
And it should be, I think, and that's

01:40:44
how I personally use it, the starting point for analysis.

01:40:48
And a difference set to a different set of methods.

01:40:50
You could do a case study, follow the thing,

01:40:53
follow your nose, and try to problematize

01:40:55
these kinds of findings.

01:40:58
But it's a way to refer to her back to that.

01:41:00
And it gives you-- that's, I think, he added value,

01:41:02
some kind of standardized overview.

01:41:12
There's a lot of things that we can say about that. I really need to press on because

01:41:17
it's taking a bit more time than expected. Are you still okay to proceed? I promise that

01:41:22
we won't take 25 minutes but maybe 20 minutes if I'm lucky?

01:41:28
Is that okay or do you want to break? Why is this going to be there?

01:41:35
Yes you can. Yeah, is there a collective need for a restroom break?

01:41:44
Is that a yes hand? Yeah, two minutes because we really because we can't take too much time.

01:41:51
So if you project that in 20 minutes, your bladder will break.

01:41:52
Go now.

Please thank your seats.

01:48:20
[BLANK_AUDIO]

01:48:27
Yeah.

01:48:37
So yeah, this one's in that view of breach should appreciate by now a long tradition of

01:48:42
rural and global cities research, then this kind of severity informed the general by

01:48:43
core.

01:48:49
But at some point, and especially the early technologies, there was a danger that, or at

01:48:54
least this recent agenda was, was in terms of this, you could say dominant or hedge

01:48:58
of monitoring the wind in urban studies or for citizens in global

01:49:05
ization. And as such, it's also raised quite a bit of criticism. And I think it's debatable

01:49:10
to what extent this is just quite some points of this. Certainly as other points, I think

01:49:15
I'm personally, but I'm also kind of involved in these debates a bit more in the wild.

01:49:20
I'll just take you through them. And I hope to do so within the next 20 minutes.

01:49:28
Right, I think we can say, I still think that the aristarch can be powerful to the map and

01:49:34
spatially analyze global connections, but clearly something can be said that. I'll just skip that

01:49:40
and cut the business. One of the most important things and most French and critiques

01:49:48
I think it was Lawrence, I think the beginning of the notice by a famous scholar Jennifer Robinson,

01:49:59
South African working from London, wrote a book, Ordinary Cities. However, papers was

01:50:04
World Cities or a World of Cities where she kind of

01:50:12
was with frustrated with this dominance of world cities research

01:50:14
in the debate about city city globalization.

01:50:17
And it says, and she says, well, it's quite a different thing

01:50:21
about world cities for the globalization of cities more

01:50:22
wide.

01:50:25
And that's good reasons for this difference,

01:50:29
or the lack of what world and global cities

01:50:30
research was doing.

01:50:33
Then in addressing cities in globalization,

01:50:38
Since I've seen the map, a lot of the cities around the globe,

01:50:39
and especially in the global south,

01:50:44
are basically dropped off a physical, natural map, right?

01:50:48
So we find that there's a lot of connectivity

01:50:50
in your Western Western European,

01:50:52
or the American Asian cities,

01:50:55
but it's actually very little to be told

01:50:59
about African cities that basically not represent the environment.

01:51:02
So an issue of representation there,

01:51:11
in her view, but it also deals with how we conceptualize world and world cities.

01:51:18
And in her argument, we focused too much on a limited number of economic processes,

01:51:21
whereas all the kinds of connections remain unsteaded.

01:51:26
One of the examples that was already given was, yeah, you can look at remittances,

01:51:30
and you would get a completely different view, perhaps,

01:51:34
on these carbon networks.

01:51:38
So how kind of claim is that, by doing so,

01:51:42
by these, say, geographical and sexual biases,

01:51:43
well, cities of search has ignored

01:51:45
the wrong position of numerous ordinary cities

01:51:46
in the global economy.

01:51:52
And there's a tendency to, you could say, offer

01:51:54
a Eurocentric global city theory,

01:51:58
and then projecting that other areas of the world.

01:52:02
So, a postcolonial critique,

01:52:04
it's concerned with, you can say,

01:52:09
power relations in the production of theories and concepts.

01:52:14
And how these concepts and theories are reproducing

01:52:17
existing inequalities.

01:52:19
And these are also geographical,

01:52:23
so it's social, spatial, and even as the global scale.

01:52:27
If we keep on kind of reiterating the dominance

01:52:31
of certain kinds of activities, come up with certain kind

01:52:34
of maps, measuring things in a certain way,

01:52:37
in the anthropod of the process and part of the body,

01:52:39
if you will.

01:52:44
So I think there's certainly an argument to be made there.

01:52:48
I think representation is problematic in my own research

01:52:50
that was also kind of the starting point

01:52:51
of why it was interested in looking

01:52:56
into Islamic finance as a way to understand Middle Eastern.

01:53:02
World's deformation process is not to a traditional lens

01:53:05
of the classic APS firms, but to look at, okay,

01:53:09
to what extent or local norms and ethics,

01:53:12
religious and other regarding finance,

01:53:18
giving rise to a global sector in an overt zone,

01:53:20
that could then also start,

01:53:22
So I was in the back interurban connections.

01:53:27
That was kind of what I did in my own work on Islamic finance.

01:53:31
So I certainly am extremely sensitive to this autumn.

01:53:35
But at the same time, we also have to be clear

01:53:39
that part of this criticism perhaps also out of place.

01:53:42
I think Jennifer Robinson really starts from an urban studies

01:53:46
critique, which you also understand.

01:53:49
You can say globalization and its plurality,

01:53:53
not just economic but otherwise and even within economic processes,

01:53:56
or why diversity, rests for God.

01:53:59
I think that the purposes, how can we understand

01:54:01
the reproduction of uneven development

01:54:05
on a global scale, at least in the free-to-manion tradition,

01:54:10
where it was about how can we explain the fact

01:54:13
that there's still under development

01:54:17
and on the rate that the Frank serves in the global south,

01:54:19
does it have something to do with the support

01:54:23
and position of these cities in macro processes,

01:54:26
macro capitalist process?

01:54:30
So is it something with the extraction of value,

01:54:32
organized through these corporate networks

01:54:36
and supported by these previous firms that actually explains

01:54:38
why these cities are not on the map?

01:54:39
So is this a result?

01:54:43
Is this not a neglect of these places?

01:54:46
The fact that these places are not represented means

01:54:50
either bypassed by these core protectors

01:54:53
or that they potentially are subordinate in those process.

01:54:56
Which could then be a question of, is this really case?

01:54:59
Can we look into these processes?

01:55:02
So sometimes a bit of a confusion, I think,

01:55:05
between kind of a deliberate choice,

01:55:07
not only include certain places

01:55:09
whereas some of these maps are actually to be taken

01:55:12
as a result of a critical analysis.

01:55:17
I do agree that in a number of,

01:55:20
You could say analysis that are more technical in nature,

01:55:22
in terms of the world city network,

01:55:25
this kind of critical edge was sometimes lost.

01:55:29
And there's a kind of mission drift towards mapping networks,

01:55:31
whereas the connection to process of uneven development

01:55:32
was less clear,

01:55:36
it's a bit of my personal crusade

01:55:41
to make the connection to the critical agenda again.

01:55:42
So this, but certainly,

01:55:46
Jennifer Robinson points us to be very clear

01:55:49
clear about what it is that we are measuring

01:55:52
to this kind of growth analysis and what we're not.

01:55:55
So it's about placing them at these kind of methods

01:55:58
in a wider, you can say,

01:56:02
a firmament of methods to work with that.

01:56:07
Now, with this also connect to what kind of practice

01:56:10
we wish to endorse within the tradition

01:56:14
of urban studies, in the sense that,

01:56:19
And this is kind of our personal disappointment

01:56:23
with a lot of research that has followed the work

01:56:26
by Jennifer Robinson, the version for Amazon itself.

01:56:30
But there's a lot of tendency with we're which Jennifer or Jenny.

01:56:35
And a very reductionist representation

01:56:36
of her legitimate claims.

01:56:39
And we actually wrote a paper about this

01:56:41
with these religious title,

01:56:48
to kind of throw that and speak, where we kind of deal with distilling what is kind of

01:56:52
justified criticism and where we think it's a bit too much.

01:57:00
And what we particularly regret is that some of the criticism has led to disengaged or

01:57:06
a plumberism where it's a kind of rejection, so in the genus to do something else without

01:57:10
taking stock about of the knowledge that is produced here.

01:57:16
So what we try to then propose is some kind of a middle ground is a more engaged form

01:57:21
of urban studies debate, which also means that you say yes, these kind of global white

01:57:24
analysis or well-setty research.

01:57:29
In general, we need to put it in its place, but it doesn't mean that we can try to work

01:57:35
at this concept to make sense of places beyond the short list of world cities.

01:57:42
It would be that I'm battling and I'm defending and explaining myself in different kind of race and unnecessary race.

01:57:45
But let me try to make it work clear.

01:57:47
Because they are very rude.

01:57:51
Manila. We don't need world safety concepts.

01:57:55
The world city is a Euro mountain invention.

01:57:57
I can't do anything with that.

01:58:00
It could be something that you could say.

01:58:06
We need a conflict of the Middle Eastern city of the Asian city because everything is particular

01:58:13
and then we need to build that theory and then it's so unique in particular that you can't land.

01:58:23
So people disagree and say, look, there's no one-on-one projection of world city formation as a process

01:58:27
on a city like the Hudefur instance or Manila.

01:58:33
But we'll have to work with the concept to see to what extent it does explain something

01:58:35
of what we find and what extent it doesn't.

01:58:44
And perhaps we need to enhance or tailor that first find the concept.

01:58:49
And in the process, we potentially may even learn something about the place that we study.

01:58:55
But at least we still remain in the position that we can speak back to the original debate,

01:58:57
which is I think the point of urban studies

01:58:58
that were not lost in translation,

01:59:02
will try to connect with some kind of organ eye

01:59:04
or overarching debate,

01:59:07
even if you're studying very diverse places.

01:59:11
Now, yeah, I won't say too much about this two cases

01:59:13
because it's also part of our discussion seminar,

01:59:17
but just to point out the kind of contrasting cases.

01:59:19
So in one paper we looked at the LUTs,

01:59:22
which is kind of interesting place.

01:59:25
we put a more by exact,

01:59:28
that role-to-information process.

01:59:34
So what you see is a built environment with skyscrapers.

01:59:39
They obviously took a hit and are taking a serious hit currently

01:59:43
with the entire term of the country, isn't.

01:59:46
But on the first side, say, OK,

01:59:49
there's actually, when you start looking at APS activities,

01:59:51
it's actually very little going on there.

01:59:56
There's a lot of very little regional headquarters, the ferry there were international firms.

02:00:07
But when you then start looking into yes remittance flows and the Aspara, you find that almost one-fifth of Lebanese economy is made of these remittances.

02:00:19
And a lot of it faces that, to a BS professionals, that are located in the Gulf so it's our McKinsey trained, but agreed consultants, McKinsey's living,

02:00:23
that is them advising the Saudis or people in Dubai, the elite leader of Dubai,

02:00:31
that earn their money there, send back their money and buy a hugely overpriced apartment

02:00:36
in the city centre of the Greenhouse. The real estate market which is then

02:00:42
kept artificially booming by almost free credit from the central bank of Lebanon,

02:00:48
which is also the personal property of the living families of Lebanon.

02:00:51
So it's kind of connected.

02:00:55
Now in any case, it shows you that if you follow your nose,

02:00:58
in a sense, there's still awesome characteristics

02:01:02
of world to deformation, especially in the role

02:01:04
of a high-skilled labor.

02:01:05
But it's a kind of--

02:01:09
it's in some of the parts of regional capacity building,

02:01:13
regional circuits of failure that are kind of connected

02:01:15
back to the city.

02:01:20
So it's function as a capital sink to the region,

02:01:24
rather than as a kind of server service in the liveries.

02:01:27
If you look at Manila, it's kind of the opposite.

02:01:29
You'd say, wow, a lot of activities there,

02:01:32
a lot of APS firms, they're all there.

02:01:35
But then you suddenly into these activities,

02:01:36
and there's something that you know,

02:01:38
a collaborative has done.

02:01:41
It's basically part of the largest one of the largest

02:01:45
outsourcing sectors of tendencies that you find.

02:01:47
So a lot of back office activities,

02:01:50
for global banks and other kind of service providers,

02:01:54
but it's not really come up in control,

02:01:56
or not at least not what we think of it.

02:01:59
And it may also work through

02:02:02
and what it can explain in terms of the segmentation

02:02:03
of the labor market,

02:02:06
but because it would not be high-end managers

02:02:09
that are then gentrifying neighborhoods,

02:02:12
but it may arise through middle-class or something.

02:02:17
So it may result in other kinds of labor market structures.

02:02:20
But at least we can still refer back to world cities

02:02:22
and start comparing to what is going on elsewhere.

02:02:25
So this is an example of an encompassing approach

02:02:29
to try to encompass diversity in your research design

02:02:31
and try to make sense.

02:02:32
So that's how we solve it.

02:02:34
I won't say anything more because I want

02:02:38
to leave something for the debating session.

02:02:45
The second point of criticism is social constructivity.

02:02:50
Again, it's the same in the sense that representation matters.

02:02:55
And this is the great work by Dory Massey,

02:03:05
who was a transatlantic nice economic juggler for from the UK,

02:03:07
thought about spatial divisions of labor

02:03:11
was one of the leading voices in a lot of progressive debates

02:03:14
in geography.

02:03:18
And she also wrote a book, "World City in 2007,

02:03:23
I wish kind of engaged with this agenda."

02:03:31
And what she basically says in this book is, yeah,

02:03:36
world cities are not just a given, an economic geographical

02:03:40
reality based on, as we said, the clustering

02:03:44
on these ABS firms, their labor markets, et cetera, et cetera.

02:03:50
They are, but they're also a product of discourses,

02:03:52
representation, et cetera, et cetera.

02:03:58
So they're mediated by political interests, elites,

02:04:03
others, and other actors that project certain discourses

02:04:10
about world and global cities and these also have ultimately performative effects.

02:04:14
So they produce or go produce certain realities.

02:04:17
It's a bit kind of knowledge theory.

02:04:23
So the world is also to some extent shaped by how you represent this.

02:04:28
And then you can be an ardent, very strong believer of that and say, okay, the world is

02:04:30
almost exclusively,

02:04:32
reducible to how we represented

02:04:33
whereas others would work more in

02:04:35
kind of materialist fragrance,

02:04:37
okay, not everything is shaped by words, right?

02:04:41
So I think I'm gonna look at the other,

02:04:43
it's kind of something to think about

02:04:46
toward extent, representation actually matters.

02:04:51
Now, Jourine explains this for London,

02:04:53
and she says, yes, it's a globalized financial center,

02:04:55
but the way you perceive it

02:04:56
and the way the city reproduces itself

02:05:01
is the outcome of a decade-long battle of representation,

02:05:04
which was led by government finance elites, politicians,

02:05:10
not often not seldomly connected to all boys' networks

02:05:13
that have been projecting the world city status of London.

02:05:17
And this has become some kind of a hedge in life.

02:05:21
Unquestioned, near-liberal growth strategy,

02:05:26
has been part of that new liberal strategy since the eight.

02:05:31
And the kind of ideas that what is good for the financial industry is good for the city.

02:05:35
What's good for the city is good for London, what's good for London, what's good for the Saudis,

02:05:39
what is good for the Saudis is good for UK.

02:05:48
And dear Europeans, what is good for the UK is also good for Europe, so please deregulate the Afghans.

02:05:57
So it's a rhetorical strategy she calls the passport total where the part is there to represent the whole.

02:06:04
So it's the interest of the city of London which are projected to be the interest of the UK citizen.

02:06:11
And again, as Brexit has shown, this has been quite radically rejected.

02:06:16
Again, whether legitimately or not.

02:06:23
So, yeah, there's this neoliberal growth strategy, and it also was connected to legitimate

02:06:26
legitimate material decisions.

02:06:32
In the sense that, if you look at this course, it's about dust, heat, growth, you need

02:06:35
a new runway because of capacity issues.

02:06:36
Yes.

02:06:42
London cannot keep up with its global safety status or it cannot grow its connection to

02:06:46
new emerging markets if it doesn't have an extra runway.

02:06:53
So please, papers go away or needle your ears.

02:06:57
But we absolutely need this.

02:07:00
And in global city discourse is there to justify it.

02:07:02
But also when you look at the construction of the UK,

02:07:07
colony in the '80s, I mean, closing the mines, et cetera,

02:07:07
et cetera.

02:07:11
And this has produced very uneven outcomes in the UK.

02:07:13
A lot of cities in the north and opening

02:07:15
mining areas in the industrial areas.

02:07:17
So decline.

02:07:19
And at that point, what would have been interesting

02:07:24
is low interest rates, that could boost investment

02:07:27
to restructure these peripheral economies.

02:07:28
That didn't happen.

02:07:30
And at that point, there was an inflation,

02:07:33
there was high interest rates, which made,

02:07:35
but simply money very expensive.

02:07:39
And which made that it was very hard

02:07:41
to seek investment into these areas.

02:07:43
And obviously, there was only interest of the Southeast,

02:07:47
which generate an influence into financial services,

02:07:52
et cetera, which then further grew global city London.

02:07:54
So it's a particular political agenda

02:07:58
that is behind there that has produced there.

02:08:02
There are final points that we as academics

02:08:06
or academics to be are not neutral bystanders

02:08:08
and her claim is that especially when you start looking

02:08:12
at these world city rankings that GOC

02:08:14
is claimed to produce.

02:08:16
This is part of the problem.

02:08:19
It's kind of fueling the self-fuling prophecy

02:08:23
as giving people in the city of Roman.

02:08:25
The instruments that they exhibit to say,

02:08:29
look, we're still leading city parts

02:08:30
Dubai is closing.

02:08:31
Please, come on.

02:08:34
We need further investment in the city

02:08:37
or we need the regulation or something like that.

02:08:40
So that's kind of her also attention-preteaken

02:08:47
in a sense that yes, world cities research is performative in that sense.

02:08:52
So yeah, just a few slides there, and I'll return to that.

02:08:58
I mean, the pictures that we have of representations that we have of London are the

02:09:03
glitz and glam quite often, and it's typically the city.

02:09:08
But then how city is kept, the city of London is kept working on the wider metropolitan

02:09:10
and how it remains often undiscovered

02:09:13
or something that we'll talk about next week.

02:09:18
Yeah, and this is kind of battle of representation

02:09:20
is ongoing, this is a bit of a data figure

02:09:24
and still with Theresa May there

02:09:28
who was going for a global Britain agenda.

02:09:33
And again, you see that this kind of city elite

02:09:36
is trying to push it in the whole campaign

02:09:41
in a certain way, threatening to leave the city of London,

02:09:45
which would then impact, you could say,

02:09:49
the global city status of that city.

02:09:51
So it's kind of still the same repertoire

02:09:56
that has been used at times when Brexit was still

02:10:01
unfinished business, probably not still not unfinished

02:10:04
business, but for that.

02:10:07
Now, I think, and then I really almost have the close

02:10:10
performativity is a very important criticism.

02:10:12
It's something that we should be very reflexive about.

02:10:16
It basically means the influence that it

02:10:19
reduce kind of figures that you could use the maps

02:10:20
that you produced or what they spend

02:10:22
to their shape and impact.

02:10:24
Theality to what extent are they picked up?

02:10:27
What is the responsibility of a researcher

02:10:32
to keep ownership over his or her results?

02:10:35
do we have an impact on that?

02:10:37
And it's something that is also very important

02:10:41
to reflect on in relation to world cities and global cities.

02:10:44
And there I think my personal stance is that we should

02:10:49
probably not exaggerate the influence of world

02:10:51
and global cities research in the sense

02:10:55
that it's only part of a much wider phenomenon

02:10:58
of city rankings, et cetera, et cetera.

02:11:00
And as you will start looking at it,

02:11:05
It's often behaviors from themselves that come up with all kinds of rankings and they're

02:11:13
much more picked up in popular debates, but for politicians that once again, a world in

02:11:19
global cities status, provided and referring to GOG in and of itself.

02:11:24
I mean, it would be a pleasure to actually know that people would meet economic papers,

02:11:26
but I think it's actually quite limited.

02:11:29
So yes, we need to be reflexive about them at the same time.

02:11:32
It could give me a little bit overblown.

02:11:35
And rankings are produced probably by other factors.

02:11:41
I'm sorry to run through this.

02:11:42
Another point is--

02:11:51
this is a criticism that deals with, to what extent,

02:11:53
world and global cities takes into account,

02:11:57
because of political economy processes,

02:12:00
or the politics of global city formation,

02:12:05
I think that connects to the work of Dorian Massey.

02:12:08
And it's kind of an agenda that was pushed

02:12:12
by new Brenner, especially at the end of the 1990s.

02:12:15
And he says, well, it's not just economic geographies,

02:12:18
it's not just agglomerations, clusters, et cetera, et cetera.

02:12:20
What we need to account for is the restructuring

02:12:27
of the economy and what he says, a rescaling of the nation state.

02:12:31
So the way capitalism is being governed

02:12:34
is not exclusively at the national scale,

02:12:36
but something is happening at the same time

02:12:38
it's becoming super national.

02:12:40
So you get a whole kind of international organizations,

02:12:43
IMF, OECD, et cetera, et cetera.

02:12:45
And Europe, Europe being union that starts

02:12:49
to increasingly govern the economy.

02:12:53
And at the same time, there's a kind of devolution,

02:12:56
growth in the importance of regions, of cities,

02:13:00
as governance layers, and some kind of a hollowing out

02:13:01
of the national level.

02:13:04
So in the words of new Breneary talks

02:13:07
about globalization, as the undoing of the state,

02:13:09
will that be because the re-spatialization

02:13:12
or re-territory realization of the state,

02:13:15
where it attaches itself to new spatial layers.

02:13:18
And it calls these new state spaces

02:13:22
to which you have new kinds of new state projects.

02:13:23
The road project.

02:13:27
So to summarize that seems a bit complex,

02:13:31
but there's a shift in how national economies are

02:13:34
being managed in terms of spatial scales.

02:13:36
It's also happening a much more entrepreneurial way.

02:13:40
And I'll say more about that next week.

02:13:44
But the point is that these are politically negotiated

02:13:50
process. And you can have a look at this overview slides to the kind of detailed

02:13:56
process that are going on there. But just to give one example, they also kind of gave last week

02:14:03
Brussels, it's kind of in this straight jacket of the Brussels capital region, where it doesn't

02:14:11
refer to the spatial scale of the actual netfalls in area of ordinary economic weight of

02:14:20
of the city, whereas in other contexts you see the formation of the larger metropolitan areas

02:14:28
as governance structures, where global city front foot is now a fresh line line, which

02:14:34
have kind of worked in a global city region, organization, which has its own governance

02:14:42
structure etc. So there it's easier to appreciate that emeritus when you compare that to

02:14:48
So it's a rescaling process and you see that in a lot of Europe being contacted not

02:14:55
seldomly also kind of pushed for by the European Union, who likes to see the Europe of

02:14:56
regions.

02:15:04
It's kind of this idea that you need larger entities, city regions or regions, to kind

02:15:08
of take control over up to scale economic processes.

02:15:12
So, yeah, a sensitivity to how the state,

02:15:15
especially reorganize itself to all extent,

02:15:17
there's new governance layers to manage

02:15:19
also these economic processes.

02:15:22
That was kind of also added to the state.

02:15:25
And then finally, very final slides,

02:15:29
is this kind of a critique or a criticism

02:15:34
by people working in the realm of financialization.

02:15:37
I'll say much more about that,

02:15:40
if you take the economic and financial geography course,

02:15:43
it's all about financialization.

02:15:45
But just the point of the fact that

02:15:50
this criticism deals with what it is

02:15:52
that is going on in world cities.

02:15:57
So it doesn't really criticize the relevance

02:16:01
of command and control practices in world and global cities.

02:16:03
But it says that perhaps the nature

02:16:05
of these activities has transformed

02:16:09
to the past 20 or 30 years.

02:16:12
So financialization, what does it mean?

02:16:17
It means that an increasing part of economic processes

02:16:20
or value-based processes of profits generally

02:16:23
versus well occurring, you could say,

02:16:25
reproductive activities, but is somehow

02:16:26
connected to financial service.

02:16:31
So financial investments is by owning financial assets

02:16:36
rather than actually produce something that people get rich

02:16:40
and also explains a real way in the qualities

02:16:44
between those who have large huge amounts of wealth

02:16:46
and others who rely on their nature

02:16:50
but we'll say something about that next week.

02:16:53
So financialization also means that there's a lot

02:16:58
of pressure on corporations to generate returns

02:17:00
for financial investors.

02:17:03
So it's not just about competing with other capitalists

02:17:06
to be the most efficient drug producer

02:17:08
or cooking manufacturers.

02:17:12
It's also to do so, to generate as much shareholder value

02:17:14
compared to your competitors.

02:17:17
It's one, I mean, this kind of quote,

02:17:18
corporate financialization.

02:17:21
It's the restructuring of corporations

02:17:24
so that the shareholder value is actually being created.

02:17:28
So perhaps world cities are still

02:17:32
about seamless service for globalization,

02:17:35
so the management of global production process

02:17:36
is networked.

02:17:39
But this other side, financial markets, perhaps,

02:17:41
needs to be taken much more seriously.

02:17:44
And these ABS firms may be more in broad and broad

02:17:49
in broad process of finalization, rather than productive

02:17:49
as logics.

02:17:53
So yeah, just--

02:17:59
So yeah, I think what I say here,

02:18:03
we also need to become a obligatory message for other reasons

02:18:06
than the ones that have been assumed already.

02:18:10
And that's why in one paper we talk about an augmented

02:18:15
world city hypothesis is not just about generating value

02:18:19
from productive activities, but it's also about extracting

02:18:26
extracting value to rent extraction practices from those global production networks.

02:18:31
And you can see that, for instance, when we have corporations attract funding, you need

02:18:40
a whole amalgamation of connected ABS firms to issue, in this case, a Euroball, which

02:18:44
is not kind of an offshore investment instrument.

02:18:48
And this is a firm, a real-state corporation,

02:18:54
out of Northern Germany, and kind of pays all these people

02:18:57
to issue that on a global scale.

02:19:01
So to finance its real estate projects in Germany.

02:19:04
So, well, cities are mobilized to attract funding

02:19:08
and to optimize that in a particular way.

02:19:11
The same thing happens when you look at the other side

02:19:17
equation when value has been produced, the point is that you limit the

02:19:24
taxes that you have to pay on your service value. Otherwise, shareholders are

02:19:27
in the police and you're competing with other firms to pay as much share

02:19:33
other value as possible. This is a classic example by Google who is using

02:19:44
Don't Dutch, Irish, sandwich to make sure that it minimizes its taxes, right?

02:19:48
So it puts, I mean, I say it's a bit as an accident, I don't know, then by the way,

02:19:54
but it places some intellectual property in an environment that surrounds it through the Netherlands,

02:20:01
towards the back of Ireland, and then it passes through the Caribbean to optimize that structure.

02:20:06
It's also something that firms like Deloitte and law firms are also engaged.

02:20:11
So it's the optimization of these kind of financial structures and

02:20:16
materialization is also a very important function of world city.

02:20:19
So in the end, I think to summarize the picture,

02:20:24
it's about, I can say, representation.

02:20:32
You can think about world cities as kind of Mount Everest's aggloperations of wealth.

02:20:37
That has been generated among the little down below across the territory.

02:20:46
But you can also think about how to call an English-dumerion gas 11 kilometers deep.

02:20:51
Where a value that is being produced elsewhere is being extracted to.

02:20:58
is basically putting a drain on the global economy.

02:21:02
And if you look at what happened during the financial crisis,

02:21:05
the financial sector created a whole surplus.

02:21:08
If you will generate a lot of profits,

02:21:09
then came the crisis.

02:21:15
And I mean, I think in Europe it was the figure of $700 billion

02:21:17
that financial sector was kind of bailed out.

02:21:19
It was even more in the US.

02:21:24
So it's a huge figure of saving these kind of activities,

02:21:28
where in general they actually put in that drain

02:21:30
on the floor when they come.

02:21:32
So we really have to think about world cities

02:21:36
in a critical way, what do they contribute,

02:21:37
or what are the actors in world cities,

02:21:40
what do they contribute, and what kind of things

02:21:43
effects are more problematic.

02:21:46
I'm very sorry to take a little bit more of your time,

02:21:51
But that was kind of four ways of being critical about world and global cities.

02:21:57
There's no time for Q&A now, but next week we'll continue.

02:22:03
I mean, we can start with some questions next week if you'd have them.

02:22:08
And we'll go to the flip side to the point.

02:22:10
About flip side of the coin is just polarization.

02:22:15
So what does it mean world and global city formation for these very places?

02:22:22
And these are the two texts that you're worried and fighting to reach.

02:22:25
Thank you.

02:22:28
(audience applauds)



# 3 Polarization in world/global cities

00:00:24
[Music]

00:00:29
Okay, well, everybody, third session, urban social geography.

00:00:35
This week's topic is polarization, rural and global cities.

00:00:39
Now, just a few housekeeping announcements.

00:00:43
I think in the meantime, everybody has seen schedules regarding discussion seminars.

00:00:46
I think there's still some minor issues here and there.

00:00:52
We'll try to get that sorted as soon as possible, but make sure next week there will be

00:00:57
a discussion similar to each one of you. So please attend and if you're there to present

00:01:04
take the guidelines which has five to six to ten minutes of presentation because it will be a

00:01:10
tight exercise in any case. So I have to practice a little bit at home so that you stay within

00:01:17
those ten minutes as much as possible and then we'll have a nice discussion.

00:01:22
also be advised that we started excursions this Friday on start in Brussels for those

00:01:31
urban in urban studies who are joining the global city Brussels excursion and as a reminder we need at

00:01:41
them at the north station Brussels north and we need at plus similar bolifier which is the main

00:01:47
square at the side of the World Trade Center looking towards the canal. So

00:01:53
Simon Bolivad and you'll see if you're early either me wearing a very special

00:01:59
hat perhaps and some roses and then if you're late you'll see a whole bunch of

00:02:04
people so you can't really miss us. In any case you will be down the stairs

00:02:09
and somewhere on the square there's a few benches there. We will probably

00:02:13
We end around five at latest in European quarter.

00:02:18
And yeah, you can bring lunch,

00:02:20
but you can also buy lunch somewhere

00:02:23
that will be time over at lunch time

00:02:26
to actually buy lunch wherever you want to.

00:02:28
So that's not necessary.

00:02:32
I have no idea whether it will be the police,

00:02:35
check the weather forecast and just accordingly.

00:02:38
And as I've learned, the pencil works better than a pen.

00:02:44
It's kind of a weather proof, although I hope it's not a tornado that's going to hit Brussels.

00:02:45
Okay.

00:02:47
Right.

00:02:56
So last week we've been talking about, you could say how to understand the role of cities in the global economy,

00:03:06
whole discussion about command and control functions, to what extends power in this global urban system relates to either headquarters

00:03:13
workers and the more classic world cities definition or are the first to say this amalgamation

00:03:23
or complex of advanced producer services who collectively produce control capabilities

00:03:28
over global production networks, global financial markets and also discuss plenty of critiques,

00:03:33
different forms of critique on those startups.

00:03:40
What we'll try to do today is turn the coin around and kind of in the spirit of John

00:03:46
Friedman's work back to the 80s, if you will, is also try to reflect on what extent

00:03:53
the insertion in these global urban systems, these powerful roles in the global economy,

00:03:56
also affects the internal structure of cities.

00:04:00
So it's kind of this macro, micro link.

00:04:04
We went from, oh my god, the economy is globalizing.

00:04:09
What does this tell us about the changing role of cities

00:04:10
in that global economy?

00:04:15
Now having established that centrality in the global economy,

00:04:19
now we wonder to what extent there are effects or implications

00:04:23
of that insertion on the social structure of cities.

00:04:29
So it's kind of the flip side of last week's talk.

00:04:33
So just to get started a little bit, some maps.

00:04:34
Was there a question?

00:04:36
I'm like, what,

00:04:39
I could be honest, I could be honest.

00:04:40
If I can do that, everyone agrees

00:04:41
because we don't break it.

00:04:43
You know, it's a must.

00:04:43
Yes.

00:04:44
It's a must.

00:04:45
Straight forward.

00:04:47
I understand, yes, it was a bit back.

00:04:49
So let's try to have a break somewhere

00:04:51
at six, something or five,

00:04:53
but I'll six, yeah, sure.

00:04:54
No problem.

00:04:56
Yeah, some maps.

00:04:58
I will, yes.

00:05:07
The live stream isn't working.

00:05:09
Okay.

00:05:15
Or rather not okay.

00:05:23
It is recording.

00:05:33
Now as you can see there's a red button there and I think the audio is supposed to work.

00:05:39
Zero viewers okay that gives us a hint.

00:05:44
Let's see.

00:05:51
wrong link. Okay, let's see.

00:06:07
All right, let me just put this online.

00:06:10
(audience chattering)

00:06:39
[ Background Sounds ]

00:06:46
It looks awfully the same.

00:06:53
Doesn't it?

00:07:19
[inaudible]

00:07:26
There's already one viewer. So that means it works. Yeah, I think we're there.

00:07:34
Is it okay? Yeah. All right, then.

00:07:46
Okay, I could just try to start again. I started so maths always nice.

00:07:54
Please unmaps from the study of the talk a little bit more about in a second from the opportunity

00:08:03
at last in the US. Basically shows you the median household income of residents over a certain period.

00:08:10
So this is Chicago, the darker, I mean the the bluer, the richer if you will, the higher the income

00:08:15
And the more the U.S. is red, it's lowering.

00:08:21
So what I've kind of seen is very much kind of concentrated wealth in the city center,

00:08:23
apparently of Chicago.

00:08:28
And then the peripheries, these kind of other rings of Chicago,

00:08:34
with lower incomes, and then going back further from the center,

00:08:39
richer neighborhoods, kind of the opposite picture here

00:08:44
In Detroit, I'll show some examples from the US because this is great material in that.

00:08:53
Here we see a very large concentration of the poverty or lower incomes in the city center,

00:09:00
or it's actually the city of Detroit, which interestingly ends at this kind of road here.

00:09:09
a tomorrow road which you may know if you still know who Eminem is. He's been talking about this.

00:09:15
The old born and raised somewhere over there. It acts as kind of a city limit.

00:09:21
You could say the inner city neighborhood and also kind of a fiscal limit.

00:09:29
At this point we see that actually it's a quite strong social spatial divide between

00:09:36
or neighborhoods in the city center and then richer. Subverts, you may know that Detroit has

00:09:44
gone into default a few years ago, so it's kind of a weird situation because it is a rich

00:09:51
agglomeration, if you will, but the city itself, which kind of ends at the 8 mile road,

00:09:55
is quite poor. So there's a lot of people commuting into the city that quite rich,

00:10:03
but the physical base of the city itself is kind of it's kind of limited. Okay. So quite a

00:10:15
large rupture there in space. Other examples are Los Angeles, a lot of inner city poverty and very

00:10:24
which suburbs, if you will, we all know Beverly Hills and those kind of areas.

00:10:33
This is Miami, just another example, from a stark contrast at the neighborhood level between

00:10:37
It's a north Miami and south Miami.

00:10:41
No, so quite a stark difference between,

00:10:46
say Miami Beach, where the tourist areas are.

00:10:50
And the continent, if you will,

00:10:53
what is kind of interesting in the case of Miami

00:10:56
is that actually from a climatological

00:10:58
environmental perspective,

00:11:02
that's actually quite safe to live all short.

00:11:05
And these are kind of the foreign neighborhoods

00:11:08
with kind of increased strength of floods

00:11:10
and those kind of things.

00:11:13
We see some kind of a movement back onshore also

00:11:14
by richer people.

00:11:18
Some people call this climate related gentrification.

00:11:21
We start seeing an appreciation of real estate values

00:11:22
onshore.

00:11:26
So it kind of shows that environmental impacts

00:11:30
also kind of start impacting social spatial divisions.

00:11:37
Another example of Nua Linz, as you may know,

00:11:44
from more than a decade ago, it was hit by a large hurricane,

00:11:50
and also had a very differentiated effect in racialized and ethnic terms.

00:11:54
A lot of people were hit, were left without help.

00:11:56
A lot of people residing in these foreign neighborhoods

00:12:01
also has a different kind of ethnic background.

00:12:05
So again, quite a bit of conditions there.

00:12:12
San Francisco looks pretty well gentrified,

00:12:15
also kind of very common sensical.

00:12:20
I mean, you look at real estate price in the wider San Francisco Bay area.

00:12:24
And it's obviously also related to this kind of happiness

00:12:34
or global city regionism that is going on there, but just still a few pockets of the

00:12:41
public for instance, China town there to the north, perhaps also the mission which is a kind of

00:12:43
which the mother neighborhood, yes.

00:12:49
Because in the city that there's a piece right there,

00:12:50
they can have a key room that will

00:12:54
get up, that can be normalized towards the specific.

00:12:57
You know what I mean about that?

00:12:59
No, I think it's, if you look at the scale,

00:13:01
it's the same everywhere, right?

00:13:04
So you can compare across cities as well.

00:13:08
It's a good point, it could mean that we kind of lose

00:13:12
some of the nuance in certain places.

00:13:16
But what you gain is comparability across cities.

00:13:18
But I can say a bit more about that in a second.

00:13:23
New York, a city that we'll be talking more about,

00:13:26
very kind of rich, lower-man-hand,

00:13:30
who worked at the north, I feel a bit like a weatherman here.

00:13:31
You're into the north.

00:13:37
It's, as we know, a bit more cloudy.

00:13:43
No, I mean, it's an area with lower incomes, the Bronx.

00:13:48
Interesting area is also here, Brooklyn,

00:13:50
which we'll be talking about a bit later,

00:13:54
which kind of follows the income characteristics

00:13:56
of Manhattan.

00:13:58
There's a kind of still lowerness.

00:14:01
And we have a little Italy, and there's

00:14:05
kind of places where still, you could say,

00:14:08
giving some shelter to people that are not crazy rich.

00:14:13
But you could say a lot of concentrated wealth in the center,

00:14:17
then a whole kind of area with a poorer population,

00:14:21
and then you could say the rich kind of suburbs begin again.

00:14:27
Now the point is not necessarily today to talk about spatial structures.

00:14:33
You'll talk a way more about that with Nick,

00:14:37
and you'll discuss segregation patterns and those kind of things.

00:14:42
What I want to focus on is mostly you could say the reality of,

00:14:47
you could say, the vision, income divisions, class divisions in cities.

00:14:50
So where do these examples come from?

00:14:53
This is, I think you'll find it the great website.

00:14:56
It's called the opportunity Atlas.

00:15:00
And what I've actually had intense to do,

00:15:04
that also connects to the work of Nick or that.

00:15:06
Things that Nick will talk about.

00:15:09
It tries to trace, you could say, neighborhood effects.

00:15:11
And the idea is that the neighborhood

00:15:15
that you raise them will have a substantial role

00:15:18
in your future life chances.

00:15:22
And they're basically, but you can read more about it

00:15:24
on this webpage.

00:15:27
They basically tracked the evolution of people

00:15:33
kind of life development or careers of people linking it back to their original

00:15:37
neighborhood. So to the place they were born. So they could say, okay, people that

00:15:44
report in the Bronx, 16 years later, what is the kind of chance they become

00:15:49
incarcerated, what is their income level, etc. etc. So it's kind of in the way

00:15:57
trying to measure some form of spatial privilege, but having resided or

00:16:03
being born in certain neighborhoods that will have actually an effect which is in some way

00:16:09
you could say reducible to the amenities that you have to the social context that you have.

00:16:13
But perhaps there's also even more than that maybe some kind of isolated spatial effect

00:16:14
beyond.

00:16:20
But that's kind of the wider context of this up-loss and I think, yeah, it's, I would have

00:16:23
hoped that we had this for Europe.

00:16:26
It's a great resource and you can browse a bit to that.

00:16:34
So what I just want to focus on today is the fact, or use as exhibits, are these income

00:16:41
maps to illustrate that polarization in terms of income is a day to day reality in a lot

00:16:44
of US metropolises.

00:16:49
Had we had the data in Europe, we would also find quite stark contrast, perhaps a little

00:16:53
bit less, but still, it would also be there.

00:17:00
So what we can discuss then today I think is to what extent clause divisions are reproduced

00:17:08
in and through space and actually try to understand why such divisions occur in cities

00:17:09
in the first place.

00:17:11
Now this is a very big debate obviously.

00:17:17
What we'll try to do is try to link that to the debate we have last week and try to

00:17:24
linked to what extends global and relatively functions add to existing polarization because

00:17:32
we cannot reduce it to an effect of having headquarters or something, but perhaps entering

00:17:39
the discussion through globalized urbanization, we could actually start unpacking some of this.

00:17:45
So, glass divisions are about the fact that we see social spatial structures on the basis of

00:17:52
social groupings of income, profession, occupational structure and those that.

00:17:59
So looking through income levels and occupation, we find a social

00:18:05
especially diverse structure. Now I use class here in a very, let's say,

00:18:13
analytical naive way because if you use class, in many cases, authors would also refer to

00:18:22
some form of identity formation linked to that. That's not what I do here. It's more of a much more

00:18:29
mundane looking at income levels to look at the change extractor of the city. There's big debates

00:18:36
to what extent there is still such thing as class identity. It has something to do with

00:18:42
existence of subcultures, depolitization, etc. That's not really the point here. It would be

00:18:46
interesting debate, it's more about can we see objective, objective,

00:18:53
viable divisions there in society based on income and occupation, okay, just to clear that

00:19:02
moment. All right, so polarization, it has been on the agenda, it has been one of the main

00:19:09
source of impetus or starting point for the world in global cities debate. And again, going

00:19:17
back to John Friedman and Sir Wolf in 1982. It's what kind of initiated their

00:19:23
interests there. So just to allow me to recite with its towers of stealing glass

00:19:27
and its scientific shopping malls, the Citadel is the city's most vulnerable

00:19:33
symbol. Its smooth surfaces suggest a sleek and personality of money power. Its

00:19:37
Its interior spaces are ample elegant and plush.

00:19:40
In a properly secluded space is the transnational elites

00:19:43
who have built their residences and playgrounds.

00:19:47
Country clubs and bridal paths and private beaches.

00:19:51
The overcrowded ghettos exist in the far shadows of the citadel

00:19:56
where it is further divided into racial and ethnic enclaves.

00:19:58
Some areas are shanty towns.

00:20:00
Not well provided with public services,

00:20:02
garbage is that does not get collected.

00:20:06
only the police in the squad cars visible in evidence.

00:20:09
In many places, get to residence or allowed outside

00:20:11
to zones only during working hours.

00:20:17
Their appearance in the Citadel After Dark creates a small panic.

00:20:21
So it's kind of a very dystopian image.

00:20:23
You can say it's exaggerated.

00:20:27
It's kind of not exactly empowering.

00:20:29
It's also very black-white.

00:20:31
But it's something with this opposition

00:20:36
that they try to work with some kind of growing divide

00:20:42
and cities that is going to become a social problem.

00:20:44
And that's also what you also read in the world

00:20:45
city hypothesis of self-self-free crime.

00:20:51
It's at some point it will become everybody's problem

00:20:54
and probably also the problem of the elite.

00:20:58
Now again, this kind of description,

00:21:00
tries to capture particular reality.

00:21:05
Last week, I think I mentioned Robert De Niro and taxi driver.

00:21:08
Perhaps John Friedman was talking more,

00:21:11
talking about contemporary LA,

00:21:15
which is kind of marked by this citadel form

00:21:18
that we have left if you have been to LA.

00:21:22
I mean, a lot of elites or people that are walking around here

00:21:24
never touch ground.

00:21:27
They hover around, they never go on the ground floor,

00:21:30
but it's kind of a problem to jump by taxi

00:21:33
and one of the hotels and then they go

00:21:34
at the first floor level,

00:21:37
or second floor level in the US,

00:21:38
from one building to another.

00:21:41
So it's not only kind of horizontally segregated,

00:21:44
there's also kind of vertical segregation there

00:21:46
so this kind of this flow of people

00:21:50
is not mixed with buses by.

00:21:55
Then a bit further, just kind of two, three, four,

00:22:02
It is both streets LA not to be confused with Wall Street in New York and this is kind of where

00:22:06
a completely different kind of neighborhood start. So as you remember this map from LA,

00:22:18
in general you could say a very poor inner city neighborhood but kind of imprinted by a number of

00:22:28
hotels which kind of breathe post-modern feelings and sentiments, but then very close to that

00:22:36
immediately you kind of struck with rapid decline. Some people would call this the zone of transition

00:22:42
and we'll be talking with Nick about the Bergus model of cities. There's a kind of a place that

00:22:48
that isn't changed. It's kind of changing functions. It's also a place where a lot of

00:22:55
migrants arrive. There's a lot of informal economy, etc. And there's also kind of an idea

00:23:02
even in contemporary LA that these places, the citadel, if you will, these hotels are also places

00:23:07
that should not be frequented by people that have nothing to do there. And just, yeah, as I walk by,

00:23:16
I think it was a doorstep of a plaza of a bank of America or something that I took it.

00:23:24
Yeah, bank tower at 53. And it's kind of regulating social space there.

00:23:28
And yeah, you can't really read it now, but maybe you should read it at home.

00:23:34
This kind of very ambiguous language being used. So any activities that are

00:23:39
has a phrase again that may be annoyance or uses,

00:23:44
that are already annoying people or could annoy people,

00:23:46
or actually not allow them there.

00:23:48
So it's a very, you could say,

00:23:52
a vigorous fake description,

00:23:55
which gives, for instance, social security guards

00:23:59
the liberty to actually remove people from public space,

00:24:07
people that are homeless and there's a huge homelessness issue. In LA, people are being displaced,

00:24:13
even if they put their tents in downtown. There's a little pan-handling selling stuff and those kind

00:24:20
of things and that is kind of policed away. So it's not, it's to be removed from that public space

00:24:26
because it doesn't fit the kind of perhaps expectations of people that that's frequent these

00:24:35
more like citadel structures. So we can say it could be an extreme example but still very much

00:24:43
relevant today, 30 or 40 years after Children's Treatment was started out. This is, say, one of the

00:24:52
leading matropolises and economic terms of the world. So if it's happening here, we could

00:24:58
imagine it's also happening elsewhere. Now what I would try to do now is look a little bit into

00:25:07
exhibits about this archetypical case if you will, New York City. To show you a bit more

00:25:17
how polarization patterns have evolved over the past decades. I mean it's a Greek drama, you know

00:25:25
already what is happening and the answer is polarization has increased. So income disparities

00:25:33
between different kind of income groups in society has increased. And why in New York? Well, I mean,

00:25:39
it's one of the, say, has been one of the city's world cities that has, has received a lot of

00:25:46
attention. It's still one of the main financial centers of the world. It's kind of an extreme case,

00:25:53
if you will, if you try to research the impact of these kind of activities on the urban fabric.

00:26:01
So, I'm referring here to a very nice study by the fiscal policy institute.

00:26:05
It's a bit dated, but I still love it.

00:26:09
I'm actually hoping that it will do the exercise again quite soon.

00:26:16
The previous one, report was just before the crisis, this one is kind of diagnosing what

00:26:21
when done just after the crisis and I hope they have some kind of I don't know

00:26:28
a bit of COVID kind of report sometimes soon but they mostly look in these studies at the

00:26:34
evolution of income distribution and they use all kind of weird terms such as these

00:26:43
styles, quintiles, quartiles which refers to the place of an income group any entire

00:26:48
So a quintile is actually a fifth of the entire distribution.

00:26:55
So top quintile would be the top 20% of earners and their average income.

00:27:02
The bottom quintile would be the average of the lowest 20% of incomes.

00:27:08
So these are relative terms that show the position with a certain income.

00:27:12
What you would take position you would take in this distribution.

00:27:17
And it's usually focusing on income, which is income

00:27:21
out of labor in one way or in order.

00:27:22
Okay.

00:27:25
So this is just one comparison.

00:27:26
And what they also do is,

00:27:30
and they try to compare New York City quite often.

00:27:34
Sometimes they don't have data on New York City itself,

00:27:36
and then they use New York State,

00:27:38
but try to be as specific as possible.

00:27:42
And then they also try to compare to United States.

00:27:43
That's a question.

00:27:47
[inaudible]

00:27:48
Yeah.

00:27:52
[inaudible]

00:27:56
[inaudible]

00:28:02
[inaudible]

00:28:07
Yeah. I think, I mean, large would be polarization,

00:28:11
but the point is indeed, and that's kind of something that we get to later,

00:28:14
is that the question is, obviously,

00:28:17
more easily start looking at income,

00:28:19
because these kinds of data are,

00:28:20
it is defined.

00:28:23
The next question is what's the underlying occupational structure,

00:28:27
so what produces that reality?

00:28:29
And there's something that we'll pick up on later,

00:28:32
and obviously connected quite often,

00:28:33
kind of you could think about,

00:28:36
shift towards high-end service jobs,

00:28:40
what generates higher incomes?

00:28:44
But the connection is not always there,

00:28:45
it's always highly contextual,

00:28:49
the same kind of occupations,

00:28:54
in different contexts may give a very different income level

00:28:56
and that can be for a lot of reasons.

00:29:01
So yeah, but here we're talking about income polarization

00:29:05
to be sure because it's the most obvious here and now.

00:29:08
So yeah, as I said, they tried to compare

00:29:13
give me your work, sometimes they use in the New York state, etc. So what you see is here,

00:29:21
the median family income, so this kind of people that are just in the middle of this distribution,

00:29:28
this has been declining over the past, I think 10, I mean, in this case it's kind of three,

00:29:36
four years after the great recession, right? So we see that 2008, it has 9, 2010, 2011,

00:29:43
you find the steep decline and it's actually more pronounced in the city of New York.

00:29:49
So the city of New York on average, the median income was already much lower than compared to

00:29:54
New York state which is kind of more affairs to the broader agglomeration mostly but then also the

00:30:02
rest of the state and it was also significantly lower at a magazine. So in general, there's a decline

00:30:09
and median income in the city of New York. At the same time what we see at the other kind of

00:30:19
side of the picture is the share of income, total income, going to the top 1%. And here is again a

00:30:28
comparison between US in red, then the state of New York in green and then New York city kind of

00:30:35
small scale in blue, which is on top line. So it's kind of interesting to see and this

00:30:41
data goes back to the 1980s. They'll share very similar patterns there at the beginning.

00:30:48
The share of income going to the top 1%, that's just reminds yourself 1% of the entire distribution

00:30:58
that the top 1% against the 99 remember was about 12% or 3% in the 1980s. This has exploded right.

00:31:08
So it has grown across all scales to something modest off, you could say 22% in the US.

00:31:15
So 1% owns 22% of all income, just reflect on that.

00:31:25
And then in New York, we see that almost 45, almost half of all income is owned by the top 1%.

00:31:32
Okay, so we all know Jeff Bezos and others, but this is kind of way more systematic. Yes

00:31:50
Yeah, but the previous one yeah, that's true. I mean this is just a figure

00:31:58
And it's one of the perfect options that you can take.

00:31:59
Yeah, this too.

00:32:00
That's right.

00:32:07
This is kind of, you could say, the median income has decreased everywhere.

00:32:10
It does seem to find here.

00:32:17
I would say that it decreases more in New York City compared to others.

00:32:21
less you would have to look at percent just there for New York State of the US.

00:32:28
But I think it's kind of going from 59 to 54. Yeah, that's a very significantly

00:32:34
client. But it's not one online comparable, you're right. So this goes back way more in time.

00:32:41
But the main point being here is that a very small percentage is actually running away with a

00:32:49
lot of income and again in the CFA, there was connection to what you were asking. There was a decline

00:32:58
in general also for these top 1% with the global financial crisis but you also see that it's kind

00:33:05
of very quick rebound of these highest incomes, right? So they kind of take a hit and it has

00:33:10
something to do probably with their, like they're exposed to so much parts of the economy,

00:33:20
but then they rebans quite soon. Okay. Another kind of graph here comparing New York state to the US,

00:33:28
so unfortunately not at the city level, but yeah, you get an idea. Here it's comparing a top 5%

00:33:36
in terms of income and total income, which you could say the bottom quintile, so the 20%

00:33:43
lowest incomes, and then the middle group, right? So from 40 to 60%, but in the distribution.

00:33:52
So what you find is that over the years, and this is comparing the late 70s,

00:34:00
to say the mid 2000s. I mean it's a dated analysis but that's the furthest that they could go in

00:34:12
this analysis. In the 1970s the ratio between the top 5% and the lowest incomes was 7.4. So people

00:34:19
in the top 5 earn 7.4 times more than people with the lowest incomes and the lowest quintile

00:34:25
By the mid 2000s it had become 17.3 times.

00:34:33
So take the income of the lowest income households times 17.3.

00:34:36
So tremendous tremendously growing difference.

00:34:43
And it's also when you prepare to get a right growing much faster than what you see in US in general.

00:34:49
And it still also pertains to the relation between the top 5% and you,

00:34:53
but you could say the middle income group or the middle class,

00:34:59
even there are kind of these disparities have doubled and they have increased more

00:35:08
when you compare it to the US. So it went from 2.9 to 5.3 compared to 4.7 when compared to US.

00:35:13
Okay, so massively increasing that difference.

00:35:17
So it means that there's a growing concentration of income in a very small group.

00:35:25
Another exhibit showing this is comparing the growth in income between different groups.

00:35:31
So the bottom quintile again, lowest incomes actually lost a share in total income.

00:35:37
When you compare the late 90s to the mid 2000s,

00:35:41
there was some growth for middle income groups

00:35:43
and it was a very large group,

00:35:48
but growth of 18 to 19% can come off the line.

00:35:50
And so the trends are kind of clear.

00:35:55
There was a slow hiccup with the global financial crisis,

00:35:57
but it's kind of a secular trend

00:36:00
where a very small percentage of the population,

00:36:11
it 1% or 5% is gaining more and more share in the total distribution of ink.

00:36:17
One way of looking at that is why that could be and we'll talk about general patterns

00:36:27
also more towards the end of today's session is looking at what happens in evolutions of productivity.

00:36:33
So with one hour of work, what kind of value do you produce?

00:36:37
How much cookies do you cut or how much hard do you make?

00:36:42
Or how much, let's say, transactions, financial transactions.

00:36:46
Can you conclude?

00:36:49
Versus the income from those activities.

00:36:56
So what you see is that from 2001 until 2011 here,

00:37:00
There's actually a 14% increase in productivity.

00:37:03
So for the same hour of work,

00:37:07
you produce 14% more wealth, if you will.

00:37:12
But when you look at the income levels from labor

00:37:14
and you will average real wage,

00:37:17
so these are the salaries that people get.

00:37:19
It has increased a little bit,

00:37:25
but it has by no means kept base with the rises

00:37:26
and productivity levels.

00:37:28
Okay, so it's kind of, it's running away.

00:37:31
So there's an increase of about,

00:37:33
what is it here, two, three, four percent?

00:37:38
As we go across those 10 years.

00:37:42
So that means that something else is probably happening

00:37:45
with the weld and value that's being created.

00:37:48
And we talked a little bit about financialization last week.

00:37:52
It means that it's, if it's not going to labor,

00:37:55
it's probably going to the factor of capital,

00:38:03
which means shareholders or you could say well-remunerated employees such as CEOs, managers

00:38:07
who actually take a growing piece of the cake.

00:38:11
What do you want to do with this?

00:38:13
Can you talk about this?

00:38:14
Yeah, this is New York.

00:38:22
Well, get to more global patterns more towards the end as a kind of an outlook exercise.

00:38:28
But it's a trend that is occurring across countries, right?

00:38:31
And there's probably no the work of Thomas Piketty.

00:38:34
It may have run a bell already.

00:38:40
He and his group of, I can say, economic historians have looked

00:38:46
at systematically at income data and income distribution data

00:38:49
in a more long-term perspective.

00:38:51
And they can't compare all countries

00:38:53
because their data sources are limited,

00:38:58
but they require a number of key European countries,

00:39:01
US, UK, Australia, et cetera, et cetera.

00:39:04
So yeah, these are unfortunately

00:39:07
patterns we see everywhere,

00:39:10
but in some contexts they're more extreme than elsewhere.

00:39:15
And US, UK, and we'll get to that at some point

00:39:18
are the most extreme cases here.

00:39:24
So yeah, runaway productivity, but not necessarily

00:39:26
more remuneration.

00:39:28
On the other side is--

00:39:34
and I think a very telling graph is, to what extent

00:39:37
can you make a living, a decent living,

00:39:41
if you work full time, all the minimum wage?

00:39:43
This was the analysis.

00:39:48
And I go back again to the 1980s, is it right?

00:39:53
Yeah, or even earlier, and you see that you're in a substantial period of time.

00:39:58
If you were at a minimum wage, you were well above the poverty line, right?

00:40:07
So you had like 120% so you could live here well decently and you wouldn't live in poverty.

00:40:09
And this has completely melted away.

00:40:15
So it became very bad in the kind of 1990s, but even well in today,

00:40:19
You see that even if you work full-time at this weight,

00:40:22
you still fall below the poverty line.

00:40:26
So it's kind of something institutionally is wrong there.

00:40:31
And the fiscal policy institute has been one of the main advocates

00:40:34
also for an increase in minimum wages.

00:40:41
And yeah, and a lot of metropolitan areas also, for instance, in London.

00:40:49
There's also kind of the month for a long living wage, which sometimes should be higher

00:40:54
than in the rest of the country because this kind of the living, it's just more expensive

00:41:01
in these large metropolitan areas. So a very dire picture, a lot of people at the very bottom

00:41:06
are not only, you could say, you could say, losing out in terms of income levels,

00:41:14
It's also still it's not sufficient to actually make to nothing when you're at that side of the income distribution.

00:41:21
So just to give you a bit of a picture from this RUB extreme case of the the sincerity of the situation.

00:41:29
And yeah you can find this report online pulling apart in New York and I would recommend that you

00:41:35
have looked at that. I think the conclusion is that we see in growing income

00:41:41
polarization in the state of New York, more narrowly in New York City, and it's

00:41:48
becoming more dramatic than the US average. Okay, over to you for another one

00:41:53
two minutes group thing and I would like to ask you why it is according to you

00:41:57
that specifically world-in global cities are becoming so

00:42:01
Okay, and then we'll take the question straight out of there. Go ahead.

00:42:30
[ Background Sounds ]

00:42:32
(people talking)

00:42:35
(people chattering)

00:43:03
[ Music ]

00:43:31
[ Background Sounds ]

00:43:59
[ Background noise ]

00:44:02
Okay, let's hear it.

00:44:04
It's when you came up with.

00:44:10
What did you come up with?

00:44:13
Yeah.

00:44:27
So there's a comment about the cost of living.

00:44:38
The correct, but it's more, you can say more a symptom, if you will, I mean, it's kind of the price of real estate, housing, daily consumption, etc.

00:44:45
You can say it affects everybody to similar degree unless we acknowledge that there's even more differences.

00:44:51
I mean, that's because of living for the rich would be also very high, but maybe they can afford it.

00:44:55
It's not really an explanation of why we see polarization at stake.

00:45:02
I think other governments are into the trickle-down effects of the regulatory development.

00:45:09
So we see large companies already have a lot of capital, getting more subsidies from the government,

00:45:17
getting placed in say special economic zones where electricity land leaves around the government.

00:45:19
A lot of things are subsidized.

00:45:24
Again, I tried to be well-providing employment.

00:45:27
However, that said employment,

00:45:29
the salary is not distributing.

00:45:33
So you have the larger company getting larger.

00:45:37
What do you mean with trickle down, logics?

00:45:38
Yes.

00:45:41
So, I mean, the right to recover that is, of course,

00:45:44
then if you have a large company,

00:45:53
It provides employment and ideas scenario is that more women, people who do it more money,

00:46:00
etc. What often happens is that the job 1% of the job which you will probably get larger

00:46:05
income and the contribution is right here.

00:46:11
So yeah, this important critique I think is also what Princess Doreen Massey was talking about,

00:46:16
I mean, and throughout her career, fighting this kind of trickle down economic principle,

00:46:24
and she talks about course of global cityization, which is actually producing inequalities,

00:46:28
which are not as much as let's wait for a bit more global city formation,

00:46:35
and it will be easy away. What she actually says, no, this polarization is an outcome of

00:46:39
of global city formation, it's because you have certain

00:46:40
activities that you have.

00:46:43
It's not something permanent.

00:46:45
And not something that will go away,

00:46:46
but more trickle down economics.

00:46:49
So because economics is something with,

00:46:52
like that you create multipliers,

00:46:54
that money circulates to the territory,

00:46:55
which then create jobs,

00:46:57
where then fuel growth, et cetera.

00:47:01
But little is said about the income levels of these people,

00:47:03
what kind of jobs are created,

00:47:06
what kind of working circumstance, et cetera, right?

00:47:08
Okay, other ideas?

00:47:09
Yeah?

00:47:13
(audience member speaking off mic)

00:47:42
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:48
So there's deliberate support for strategies, but perhaps they can also be more viable

00:47:51
and some life that's regulations compared to other places.

00:47:52
Yeah?

00:47:53
Yeah.

00:48:01
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:06
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:23
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:29
>> So yeah, the steward has a lot of local policy networks towards creating some kind

00:48:30
of business climate.

00:48:36
Well, national policies that are restructuring the detection of labor,

00:48:45
I also think that the cities are trying to struggle to attract global companies and that

00:48:50
at the end, global companies, they don't really enrich these budgets with the taxes because

00:48:56
they're either evaded, either the city trying to once get a try to build a global company

00:48:57
to try to sell some space.

00:49:05
They have in terms of subsidies, but then like taxes, if something supports the overall

00:49:11
more like insecure parts of population and then like they are like low income

00:49:18
more aggressive and then just support the opportunity. Okay let's there was a

00:49:23
little vamp's from there so spatial redistribution yeah. I would just like to add

00:49:30
the role of this state in regulation, real in taxation and also being social

00:49:34
So this is something in one of the class,

00:49:40
just mentions it very briefly about the different mental states

00:49:44
of life is like this process that's shaped in states

00:49:47
that have a more active role, and it is something

00:49:49
that also shapes this position.

00:49:52
Absolutely, yeah.

00:49:55
Yeah, you, and then at the very back, just go ahead.

00:49:58
You may have to shout a little bit.

00:50:12
I think these are ground issues. I hope that the increased design to the difference in this information is really great. A lot of people have been aware of the way there's already been a lot of questions.

00:50:40
I think it's a little bit of a lot of information about this. I think that's a good point, because I mean we also have this distinguish between, say, processes that work across the entire territory.

00:50:43
say, okay, what holds for countries?

00:50:46
What is so specific about some places that they seem to be more

00:50:49
polarized than the rest of the country, okay?

00:50:50
Yeah?

00:50:53
(audience member speaking)

00:51:14
[ Inaudible ]

00:51:15
>> Awesome.

00:51:17
Yeah. At the end,

00:51:22
>> Yeah, I was thinking also on a really awesome

00:51:25
living responsibility for social record justice.

00:51:29
I have been privatized and put on the individual

00:51:32
especially with just like the US where their relationship

00:51:35
can be more crisis, it can be hard for working class

00:51:39
to support those responsibilities that can be taken

00:51:41
from a lot of data and also like a privateization

00:51:46
of comments that are there and just my public.

00:51:52
And you say a bit more about social reproduction, because it's a very analytical term or

00:51:56
kind of almost theoretical term, what do you mean with that?

00:52:07
Just like everything for a healthcare, taking care of children, feeding your family,

00:52:11
having them not my versatility is in things like that.

00:52:16
Right, so it comes to the system, the worker itself needs to be produced in the social

00:52:22
way, it's not the time to make him the worker, physically, but also educating the worker,

00:52:29
feeding, educating and socializing into particular working culture.

00:52:30
>> Yeah.

00:52:39
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:48
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:49
>> Yeah.

00:52:54
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:59
Like, reality is, for example, like, they provide like,

00:53:03
benefits through it, like, how to create the idea of the poor

00:53:05
is just like, that's the evil, you're kind of just

00:53:06
not that close to being.

00:53:09
I'm like, I'm like, you're like, you're a father.

00:53:10
Yeah.

00:53:13
I would agree, but I think then the question is,

00:53:16
to what extent would it play out more in an urban context

00:53:19
than say, in, you know, rural Britain?

00:53:23
Maybe because it's poverty is less present there,

00:53:28
that's present there, although I would like to see map of that. But yeah, I think the

00:53:33
power of neoliberal ideas is clearly going to that. Okay, one final idea.

00:53:59
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:10
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:15
So that's something to do then perhaps with existing solidarity networks and to what extent

00:54:23
is still solidarity between people and to what extent the urban environment still supports that.

00:54:28
You've covered quite a bit of ground. I don't have it in my slides all that

00:54:32
But I think it shows what you can do collectively in trying to

00:54:37
Try to get this puzzle. So thank you for that. What I just want to do is is

00:54:42
Thank you to a number of slides because I think try to gather a number of elements and then work towards this

00:54:45
polarization thesis

00:54:51
However, full of all it is will try to try to get there and then we'll take a short break

00:54:59
So yeah conceptualization, all of books have been written about this.

00:55:06
I've been most of them referring to the global city, but there's plenty of other kind of scholarship on that.

00:55:21
As you can see in this picture, it has been one of the main kind of theorized conceptualized problems of contemporary cities and something with what you do with these dualities.

00:55:28
Jomonkov and Manuken cells talked about dual cities, Susan feinstein,

00:55:33
wrote by the divided cities, Peter Marker is another great scholar talked about

00:55:37
water cities, Berger talked about fragmented cities etc.

00:55:42
So it has been one of the main debates in urban social

00:55:47
chocolate. But it seems that all these kinds of things

00:55:53
necessarily or most emblematically start to connect to cities rather than wider

00:56:01
territories. And a lot of people start to look for particular answers as I said

00:56:07
last week I tend to go back to the 80s because it's kind of my my natural

00:56:14
cohort but quite often people go back to the 60s the 70s and this kind of wider

00:56:18
the restructure of cities and wider economies,

00:56:22
and we could say the North Atlantic sphere.

00:56:25
So it's, I mean, there's a lot of things have been written.

00:56:30
There's a rich scholarship, but arguably it's kind of biased,

00:56:34
if you will, to the crisis of cities or the crisis cities

00:56:39
have underwent in Western Europe, North and America.

00:56:41
So there's plenty of stuff that needs to be

00:56:48
written on the histories and these historical trajectories of, say, Chinese cities,

00:56:57
African cities, etc, etc. But it's not something that I can now cover today, okay? But

00:57:05
it's, yeah, kind of the general narrative that you find in these different kind of analysis

00:57:10
is that the economic restructuring kind of started in the 1960s,

00:57:15
when there's a culmination of the crisis of what they call

00:57:20
North Atlantic 4-Dism. And as I think explained last week or two weeks ago,

00:57:27
there was this system of regulating capitalism, but there was a deal, say, between the workers

00:57:35
and capital that increased productivity, would that the fruits of that and the

00:57:37
the surface of that would be shared with birds.

00:57:42
It's kind of forward going back to Henry Ford.

00:57:48
He pages workers a little bit more so there would be more productive, but they could actually

00:57:54
in fact also buy the cars that they were producing at the hellish speed.

00:57:56
So that was kind of the wider model.

00:58:02
We saw the emergence of the middle classes and the immediate post-war era.

00:58:07
could buy consumer goods because of rising productivity levels.

00:58:13
It was the invention of free time to actually spend your money and consume it as we actually

00:58:17
go to shop shops and buy stuff.

00:58:21
At some point this model kind of started to crumble.

00:58:25
There were problems with productivity.

00:58:34
It couldn't keep up with rising wages and kind of at the macro level the solution was a

00:58:41
relocation of production and you could say the start point of globalization, new international

00:58:43
division of labor.

00:58:48
The effect was that it was the industrialization in, you could say, the core of the

00:58:52
world economy, his high income industrialized places.

00:58:55
So again, we're talking about Northern America,

00:58:57
Western Europe mostly.

00:59:02
And it's set in motion to process of structural unemployment,

00:59:07
which was felt throughout countries and territories,

00:59:11
but was very, very urban and many contacts.

00:59:16
There was a lot of productive activities within cities.

00:59:20
And as these activities moved away became obsolete,

00:59:24
What happened is that you could say urban poverty

00:59:27
and an employment became very much urban phenomena.

00:59:32
So cities lost their functions, productive functions,

00:59:33
but they had to do with a lot of,

00:59:37
they could say the costs of an employment, et cetera, et cetera.

00:59:39
So we have a declining tax base

00:59:44
and in many contexts what you see is a shift towards austerity.

00:59:50
So there's less income, so this budget cuts, et cetera, et cetera.

00:59:56
So the whole idea and the immediate post war era was a strong key engine state.

01:00:01
So we had mass production, mass consumption, but also a state that was inspired by

01:00:08
German and East said, okay, if there's an issue with consumption, well,

01:00:13
the government itself will be of the first investor will make sure that,

01:00:16
that the economy keeps on going.

01:00:18
That kind of changed in this period as well.

01:00:22
The state was seen as something that had to roll back

01:00:27
its activities, stop interfering with all kinds of market-based

01:00:29
processes.

01:00:35
And so this kind of the starting point of a new liberal ideology,

01:00:38
whereas the state was still kind of setting the rules

01:00:42
of market systems.

01:00:48
It stopped indeed providing, for instance, a whole range of public goods that were mentioned

01:00:49
in many contexts.

01:00:55
So most of the, I mean, accentuated this took place in the US and UK, you can say,

01:01:01
neoliberal, harsh lands or the leading examples of that with Margaret Thatcher,

01:01:07
Ronald Reagan. But it started to creep in and affect, became some kind of a mobile policy

01:01:11
that was also in practice being implemented in other contexts.

01:01:16
Sometimes to a lesser expense in a more variegated way, etc.

01:01:23
And the whole research agenda by, for instance, Jamie Beck, a very nice and one of the leading

01:01:31
scholars in urban geography is about that. So what is neoliberalism? What is neoliberalization?

01:01:36
Is it the same everywhere? How variegated? How does it connect itself to different kinds of

01:01:43
context that's a holding here. So we see those ideas spreading a lot across a lot of these,

01:01:50
say, Western American, North American states. And in one way or another, it leads to some kind of

01:01:57
use of self-affirmative prophecy, because as the state retreats from certain areas, it

01:02:03
It regulates very often a lot of these markets, which

01:02:07
hands more power to large corporations.

01:02:13
And we already talked about multinational corporations last week.

01:02:16
And we see a rising concentration of power,

01:02:20
of industrial and financial conglomerations, et cetera, et cetera.

01:02:24
And indeed, in the process where also the state

01:02:27
is kind of rescaled, where a lot of responsibilities

01:02:34
kind of pushed to the local level, you get some kind of a self-fulling mantra of competing cities

01:02:43
to attract global capital. So that's kind of the situation where a lot of policymakers

01:02:53
could say in the 1980s, the 1980s were kind of facing a kind of zero-sum game where there's only

01:02:59
so much production for instance to take place so Amazon will have its center

01:03:06
either here or it will go across the border and what can we do about that?

01:03:12
Well David Harvey is one of the the the main scholars in this area he says

01:03:18
well what we see that a lot of policymakers are trying to do is they try to

01:03:21
to become entrepreneurial, right?

01:03:25
So whereas they were managing the territories

01:03:29
and trying to think about the spatial structures

01:03:33
of welfare, humanities, and to distribute growth

01:03:37
across the territory, you kind of get the flip side,

01:03:40
much more competitive idea about growth,

01:03:42
and a new kind of role for people

01:03:44
that were previously managing territories

01:03:47
to become some kind of entrepreneurs, right?

01:03:53
David Harvey talks about this in his famous piece and I think people in the

01:03:57
Muslim forces also discuss this with Matthew.

01:04:03
He describes the shift from urban managerialism to urban

01:04:10
entrepreneurs and where you get a different kind of mindset with boss.

01:04:15
Now, okay, so this is kind of the multiraceted structure,

01:04:18
but it's kind of the reasoning of how you could say

01:04:20
macro phenomena at some point,

01:04:23
did you a very particular urban reality?

01:04:26
And what David Harvey then does,

01:04:30
and this is a kind of a short excuse that I want to take you through.

01:04:34
What it says, okay, in these competitive circumstances,

01:04:39
we see that policymakers start to adopt a number of things.

01:04:44
a number of strategies and a number of entrepreneurs strategies and I'll take you through them.

01:04:50
Be advised and sometimes it's kind of interesting to see that people think there's kind of some

01:04:56
kind of a recipe by David Harvey say if your citizen trouble please consider

01:05:02
applying this strategy this is not what David Harvey does he kind of observes and

01:05:08
analyses this phenomena he's not prescribing some kind of entrepreneurial strategies that

01:05:11
that should be implemented by policymakers,

01:05:15
just to be clear, which reminds me of an anecdote

01:05:19
that Harvey once gave a lecture in New York.

01:05:24
And he's famous for his analysis or reading

01:05:28
of Das Kapital by my son, Marx.

01:05:31
Volume one is a very nice video on that.

01:05:33
He has a companion to capital.

01:05:37
And he also gave a lecture about that somewhere in New York.

01:05:40
And apparently there were also some investment bankers

01:05:41
in the room.

01:05:44
And after the lecture, his investment bankers

01:05:46
walked up to women and said, well, Mr. Harvey,

01:05:48
I think you have a very good understanding

01:05:50
of how finance capital works.

01:05:53
Would it be possible to hire you as a consultant?

01:05:56
(audience laughs)

01:05:59
I think he declined, but yeah, just to be very clear.

01:06:03
I mean, it's an analysis that he provides.

01:06:05
It's not a recipe that he thinks

01:06:07
should be installed.

01:06:09
All right.

01:06:11
So yeah, I mean, the first kind of thing that

01:06:14
is under pressure, if you will, is these productive activities.

01:06:18
And what it sees is that some policymakers

01:06:21
still manage to kind of keep productive activities

01:06:23
in their territories.

01:06:25
And that means that still there will be some public

01:06:27
and private investments.

01:06:31
And you could say the physical and social base

01:06:33
or physical and social infrastructure

01:06:38
So think about knowledge networks, educational facilities,

01:06:39
try to do a Spanish recap.

01:06:42
So sometimes the state becomes some kind of venture

01:06:45
capitalist itself.

01:06:46
But indeed, as has been described,

01:06:52
also try to work on all the things that are too costly,

01:06:56
reduce excessive labor costs, for instance,

01:06:59
tax breaks, et cetera, et cetera.

01:07:02
And quite often leading the idea

01:07:06
is that the city regions should become silicon valleys,

01:07:08
that that should be the ambition,

01:07:12
that they should seek to attract capital people.

01:07:16
Sometimes this kind of set to attract creative class

01:07:18
to refer to which Florida.

01:07:21
But it's kind of this idea that yes,

01:07:23
a high tech productive city is still

01:07:28
imaginable and we have to create the right business

01:07:30
environment to get there.

01:07:35
So images of clusters and there's a lot of cluster policy,

01:07:38
but it used to be, I think, in a lot of cities.

01:07:40
It's also the reason why you had dedicated districts

01:07:45
at cities linked to healthcare or biotech, et cetera, et cetera.

01:07:49
So that's kind of one stretch,

01:07:52
Gida is still imaginable for cities.

01:07:55
A second entrepreneurial strategy

01:07:57
is to compete for consumption.

01:08:00
So people have money to spend.

01:08:02
There's a spatial division of consumption.

01:08:04
What you want is that people spend their dollars,

01:08:09
euros, rupees in your country and your city

01:08:11
and not in the neighborhood city.

01:08:14
And obviously with globalization,

01:08:17
this kind of changes, we see the emergence of global tourism,

01:08:19
flows, et cetera, et cetera.

01:08:21
So there's a kind of battle, if you will,

01:08:23
to attract tourists, retirees,

01:08:27
that is a whole economy behind elderly homes

01:08:32
because, well, these are people who have pensions still,

01:08:34
and they provide a safe stream of income,

01:08:39
and you can say local consumption activities.

01:08:42
Now, there's a contradiction in capitalism there

01:08:45
because with the crisis of Fordism,

01:08:48
we see a decline in purchasing power.

01:08:52
The factor labor is typically less powerful.

01:08:56
So yeah, there's less money to spend.

01:09:05
people don't really see an increase in their real wages, as we've seen in the picture,

01:09:09
on New York, but this goes back to the 1970s for the new

01:09:16
pictures of the US that has been hardly any increase in real wages, despite huge productivity

01:09:18
growth.

01:09:29
So this conundrum in many cases has been resolved by reverting to credit, basically.

01:09:35
So instead of buying it from the salary that you have, there's an increased financialization

01:09:41
of the economy in the sense that a lot of households become dependent on credit, mostly

01:09:49
through banks to obtain housing, but increasingly also all other kinds of consumption goods,

01:09:57
goods, washing machines, cars, etc., etc. So this is kind of one way of solving that contradiction.

01:10:06
It's also trying to attract high income jobs because yeah, they have a lot of money to spend

01:10:08
and what form does it take?

01:10:13
Well, in many cases, it will have some impact on the social spatial structure.

01:10:19
It could be either state-led gentrification, it could be market-based gentrification.

01:10:26
In many cases, what you will see is that cities will try to become more attractive one way or

01:10:33
another by using heritage, architecture, and these are things that you will also talk with

01:10:39
with bus about cities are quite a fence formed into these kind of urban spectacles that are

01:10:46
collectively adding more value in the goods that are consumed there. So if you walk around

01:10:50
in spectacular neighborhood, you might be inclined to spend a bit more. Yes.

01:10:56
[ Inaudible ]

01:10:57
Yes.

01:11:00
[ Inaudible ]

01:11:02
[ Inaudible ]

01:11:07
So, we'll increase the work of the city like one in a photograph

01:11:09
and I'm not going to see it.

01:11:10
Oh, yeah.

01:11:13
[ Inaudible ]

01:11:14
Yeah.

01:11:16
[ Inaudible ]

01:11:20
And there was no really an attraction in the off-grid.

01:11:21
Oh, sorry.

01:11:27
Yeah, no, but it's kind of these examples of landmark buildings.

01:11:31
They're quite often they're used in large-scale reconversion.

01:11:34
Number one is, I think maybe you refer to Bill Bow.

01:11:36
All right, that's northern Spain.

01:11:39
So there was an open industrial area,

01:11:42
and I think it's in the 1990s already.

01:11:45
Spectacular urbanism in the sense that spectacular architecture

01:11:47
a tech-led architecture.

01:11:49
Usually there's some kind of un-global class

01:11:52
of what they call start attacks,

01:11:55
who are kind of at an old house and Zaha did her.

01:11:57
She passed away now.

01:12:01
Who connected these global circuits

01:12:06
and starts producing these kind of spectacular architectural

01:12:08
forms that then send the message to the world,

01:12:12
which can be then linked to city branding

01:12:14
or city marketing strategies, et cetera.

01:12:17
So the city in and of itself can be consumed,

01:12:22
but also plays a role in fueling consumption practices

01:12:24
within.

01:12:27
So that's kind of, if you're interested to hire,

01:12:31
David Hargner for that, he can advise you how to do that.

01:12:35
And then the third one is what he says is that

01:12:38
there's still an element of the previous system there,

01:12:40
but it's kind of transformed.

01:12:41
So, and you could say,

01:12:46
for this engineering system, the state had a role to kind of stimulate growth.

01:12:49
It was still capitalist growth, for sure,

01:12:51
across the territory somewhat evenly.

01:12:56
So, yeah, there's, you could say, general taxation,

01:13:00
there's a fund and it can be invested across the territory.

01:13:04
And lower level governments can still try to attract

01:13:06
some of that funding.

01:13:08
But it becomes increasingly,

01:13:14
You can say marketised as well, quite often you'll be competing with other cities and other

01:13:20
regions to start to attract these kinds of redistributive funds.

01:13:25
Just an overview of examples in the US, it's about where are military and defense

01:13:27
investments being made?

01:13:30
That's the story of Silicon Valley.

01:13:37
Europe is a lot of competition between regions for, for instance, regional development

01:13:45
funds which work on both competitiveness of regions, but also cohesion.

01:13:50
So it's not 100% evil or something like that.

01:13:58
But it's a mechanism to redistribute these kind of investments across a territory,

01:14:01
but increase, you can say, the capacity of these places from growth.

01:14:07
And at the same time also work towards providing amenities, child care, etc.

01:14:11
People that are joining me on Friday, I'll say a little bit more about that.

01:14:15
And basically to Brussels, the canals of for instance is one of these

01:14:19
so interactions for the European regional development.

01:14:23
When you look for people that know flounders a little bit,

01:14:27
you have stops finneving spray actin urban renewal project.

01:14:39
It's kind of led by foreigners and it's basically giving money to cities to reconvert

01:14:41
in a city neighbourhood.

01:14:49
And quite often you have to apply either you say, "Okay, I'm going to hand in a concept

01:14:50
node."

01:14:55
So you get some funding to develop your idea and then perhaps if you're a successful

01:14:59
later on you can attract funding by the Flamish government.

01:15:05
Thus far you see that it's mostly the central city's center speed and so the main

01:15:11
agglomerations that have the main capacity also to apply for these funds.

01:15:16
So it's not that all small cities can actually benefit from that.

01:15:17
There was a question.

01:15:23
I just wanted to say looking at that the way it orders like, does that play a great

01:15:24
in the district of Eastern Park.

01:15:27
Like looking at most of my church in part

01:15:30
of the government church that I have,

01:15:33
they're all running down the street.

01:15:35
So they're all running?

01:15:37
Oh, oh, yeah.

01:15:38
Yeah, that's it.

01:15:40
I mean, it is just like the blood can of like,

01:15:44
it's our past, but really it's like making choices

01:15:46
about whatever--

01:15:48
Yeah, our kind of thing.

01:15:50
Yeah, who is going to pay for this in the future?

01:15:51
Yeah.

01:15:56
So there's a question, okay, governments don't have money, how can you be talking about

01:15:57
surplus?

01:16:01
I think what I'm talking about is the surplus that has been created in the economy, which

01:16:09
is not necessarily the same as the government budget, which is under conditions of what

01:16:13
I would hope for a new austerity is kept small.

01:16:19
And then the only thing that you can do is, yeah, okay, we're going to become more efficient.

01:16:26
And a mantra that you hear often will basically have very small cuts across the board.

01:16:34
So I think it used to be, say, more in the previous thread, especially to post-17, something

01:16:42
like that, that the allocation problem was smaller because the fiscal base was larger,

01:16:47
there was more economic growth, which could be more easily taxed.

01:16:54
out, you can say, hurting corporations or people or workers. It's only at the point where

01:17:03
you can say, and yeah, there was a kind of stagnation of profits that it became very hard for

01:17:13
governments. Yeah, to how would I put this to maintain fiscal level without eating into the

01:17:15
the profits of the corporations that were still there.

01:17:20
So it's kind of a, yeah, it became a very awkward situation.

01:17:25
So they rather kind of cut back on expenditures,

01:17:29
running to increase, for instance, corporate tax rates.

01:17:33
So that could have been one way of dealing with that,

01:17:38
thinking about raising productivity levels in another way

01:17:40
by investing in technology, et cetera, et cetera.

01:17:46
that has happened to some extent, but it has merely answered across the board. I think the main,

01:17:55
I would say, trend was to keep the check on the wages of people. So yeah, this, when I talk about

01:18:00
surplus is kind of more what kind of wealth is created within the capitalist system,

01:18:08
rather than more in account, in terms of what the government runs a surplus or a benefit,

01:18:12
or a deficit, just to be clear there.

01:18:17
But yeah, despite the fact that even if there's

01:18:20
the smaller budgets available, also the allocation

01:18:24
mechanism has changed, it has become less

01:18:30
kind of an element of how would I put this managing

01:18:31
kind of growth across the territory,

01:18:35
it has become more of a competition really.

01:18:38
And you see, for instance, these urban renewal projects

01:18:42
and flowers, there's a competition to attract these funds

01:18:44
to your city.

01:18:48
And that's-- yeah, you see that it leads to some kind of--

01:18:50
when it takes a goal for an almond.

01:18:53
I mean, the planet's government is reflexive about that.

01:18:55
So it's not extreme that it's all to one city,

01:18:58
but still there's a tendency that some cities benefit a bit

01:19:00
more from that than others.

01:19:05
And that's always a tendency.

01:19:08
Yeah, I'm taking a lot of time.

01:19:12
Then the next kind of final one,

01:19:17
and then we kind of end the exchirs and go back to discussion

01:19:19
about command and control and role cities,

01:19:23
the kind of final strategy is to make sure

01:19:25
that in the international division of labor

01:19:28
in these global production networks and global financial

01:19:32
networks that you hold these functions of command and control.

01:19:35
And the state is a specific kind of entrepreneurialism.

01:19:38
Well, you're invest in physical connectivity,

01:19:42
digital connectivity nowadays.

01:19:46
Now you invest in, could say, supply side economics.

01:19:48
I've heard that a little bit.

01:19:54
So state of the art, districts, that's

01:19:56
there to attract international corporations

01:19:59
and see the federal and central business districts.

01:20:04
that what I mean with that, also invest in educating

01:20:07
the labor force, thinking about installing business

01:20:11
schools for instance in front of one of the leading financial

01:20:18
center in Germany, the university has its business school

01:20:20
financed by Deutsche Bank.

01:20:25
So there's lectures by people working at Deutsche Bank,

01:20:30
educating the new generation of critical social scientists.

01:20:32
Okay.

01:20:38
So, this kind of dynamic is particularly attaching itself to world cities and the kind of

01:20:44
idea is that if you attract these global functions, it will indeed set in motion some kind

01:20:46
of a trickle down effect.

01:20:52
It will inflate property prices because there will, as we have learned with bad prisoners,

01:20:56
they become part of international portfolios, etc.

01:21:02
So that's kind of the strategy that is set there.

01:21:07
Okay, let's have a quick break, five minutes,

01:21:09
and then we actually get to the polarization thesis,

01:21:12
which is taking all the time today.

01:21:18
Yeah, maybe if you want my last little bit.

01:21:19
Yeah.

01:21:21
(mumbling)

01:21:33
Okay.

01:21:34
Yeah.

01:21:36
Um,

01:21:37
um,

01:21:38
Okay.

01:21:40
Do you just think you can send me an email?

01:21:42
Or maybe what I can do is just,

01:21:44
but I want you to avoid that kind of,

01:21:45
uh,

01:21:47
I am a fantastic person.

01:21:49
I am a fantastic person.

01:21:52
I can just shout and say who is Bueno.

01:21:54
I know no.

01:21:57
I can say who is Bueno.

01:21:58
I know no.

01:22:00
I can say who is Bueno.

01:22:09
I think I have a Saint-Bromus who is the only person I think that we can have anyway.

01:22:16
Yeah, yeah, yeah, very normal, you can see it on the common box.

01:22:18
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:19
I have a microphone.

01:22:24
Okay, that's probably because I'm mixing with people in the other group.

01:22:27
I'll add even a dress.

01:22:31
Okay, very large.

01:22:32
Very much.

01:22:33
I'm happy to be here.

01:22:34
I'm happy to be here.

01:22:35
No, I'm happy to be here.

01:22:36
I'm happy to be here.

01:22:37
I'm happy to be here.

01:22:45
I'm happy to be here.

01:22:46
I'm happy to be here.

01:22:47
I don't know who that is.

01:22:50
But I'll just add people in the glasses.

01:22:51
Okay.

01:22:52
Okay.

01:22:53
Okay.

01:22:54
And then you can just contact one another.

01:22:55
Okay.

01:22:56
Thank you.

01:22:57
All right.

01:22:58
Get some practice back for that.

01:23:02
I think that we are going to be able to make a video of the video.

01:23:05
I think that we are going to be able to make a video of the video.

01:23:10
I think that we are going to make a video of the video of the video.

01:28:38
Okay, let's re-conheat.

01:28:41
(muffled speaking)

01:28:49
Last guest started again.

01:28:52
(muffled speaking)

01:29:07
Okay, so we have this brief ex-curse learning about different

01:29:13
entrepreneurial strategies, and I think what I wanted to show is that there's a wide

01:29:19
restructuring of the economy, and we can place growing global city formation within that

01:29:22
as one particular strategy, okay?

01:29:27
Or one particular process that is explicitly relevant for world cities.

01:29:35
Going back a little bit more to the discussion about how does this connect with polarization?

01:29:41
Well, as we found there's this, and it's mostly treatment involved, treatment and

01:29:42
testing.

01:29:49
The starting point was this observation of a change in the economic base.

01:29:54
Generally, the decline in well-paid manufacturing jobs, which is some kind of an exodus

01:30:02
because of globalization of production, and at the same time a restructuring of the economy

01:30:10
what services, as we have seen 80% of cities, is service-based, but it's both at the

01:30:19
high end and at the low end, both formal services, service markers and informal service.

01:30:24
So what kind of polarization these says? Well, there's something particular about these

01:30:31
command and control functions that fuels this polarization process.

01:30:40
Please take a seat.

01:30:48
Okay.

01:30:53
Please do a leaf roll.

01:31:00
So there's something particular about these APS and headquarters economies that will set

01:31:02
in motion polarization, okay?

01:31:09
So at one point this, you can say competition within the APM and the APS complex itself,

01:31:16
which will lead to an idea of outsourcing, getting rid of some kind of long-core activities.

01:31:25
quite often leads to low-key kind of activities that are all and a lot of context also

01:31:32
linked to some form of informal economy and a lot of migrant labor that takes care of

01:31:40
routine service jobs. Think about community functions, think about, well, the Xerox machine

01:31:43
and those kind of things, clerical work, etc.

01:31:51
Next to that, what you also see is that with these high end functions, or these command

01:31:59
and control functions, it comes with the influx of well-selling people that have a lot

01:32:06
of the spending power, that have their own desire for forms of housing, quite often this

01:32:14
sets in motion process of gentrification, so the displacement of initial populations.

01:32:19
And it's also at the level of consumption and growth of leisure activities that this needs

01:32:20
to transformation.

01:32:27
Okay, so if you host these activities, basically the managers, the CEOs, people in business

01:32:31
service, just advanced producer services, well, they have the whole ecology of control

01:32:41
amenities and hortic arts etc. So this also creates some kind of demand for low-income jobs

01:32:49
to cater quite literally to these elites. There is something particular about world cities

01:32:56
which makes that there will be an even more augmented process of polarization compared to

01:33:01
normal cities or wider territories.

01:33:06
And the end result, the idea is that you get with,

01:33:10
you get a different structure or income distribution

01:33:13
in the sense that there's a lot of growth of jobs

01:33:18
at the very top, there's a growth of jobs at the bottom

01:33:20
of income distribution.

01:33:23
And in general, because of the decline in one page

01:33:27
all remunerated stable manufacturing jobs,

01:33:30
there's a kind of a decrease of middle income groups

01:33:32
and you end up with an hourglass, okay?

01:33:35
So something like that, okay?

01:33:40
That one, this kind of figure shows how that works.

01:33:44
It's a bit hard to decide for here,

01:33:46
but there's the growth of M,

01:33:49
which is a part of managerial class.

01:33:53
So CEOs of international corporations

01:33:57
Link to that is P is a kind of the producer services

01:33:59
or the long business services that we're

01:34:00
going to be talking about.

01:34:04
Then below that, C is all kinds of terrible tasks.

01:34:06
OK.

01:34:10
Minial tasks and kind of taking care of administration,

01:34:11
such as et cetera.

01:34:14
In the current day and age, these activities

01:34:17
are also kind of being localized and off-shore,

01:34:20
and of themselves, the 1980s, that their back office

01:34:24
works still to place in global cities.

01:34:28
So at the same time, you say, a growth,

01:34:32
you say, in informal markets or informal parts of the economy.

01:34:39
And these are often also based on, on micro play.

01:34:46
For instance, what I have here, I mean, all these kind of amenities

01:34:50
that we're talking about, Hordika,

01:34:53
leisure activities, kind of support by that.

01:34:57
There's informal production facilities

01:35:00
that are re-emerging in cities.

01:35:03
And then, yeah, the assumption moves and other kinds of things

01:35:07
that are also emerging there in connection

01:35:12
to the rise of this APS complex and global corporation.

01:35:15
So in general, what you need to remember

01:35:22
is you have an exodus of these high wage manufacturing jobs, that's what kind of is the main

01:35:32
infrastructure and a kind of influx of workers often from a global scale of foreign migrant workers

01:35:39
that quite often end up in informal labor markets. No that I still have this one, you don't mind how

01:35:46
So a general structure of this labor market and importantly and what sets

01:35:53
more than global cities apart from you could say. Rest of the territory or small cities

01:36:00
is that this labor market becomes globalized. And it speaks, you say, both sides of this

01:36:09
hourglass that works at the top level, we have the high-paid migrants and it works also at the lower

01:36:11
of income distribution.

01:36:14
And quite interestingly,

01:36:17
sometimes quite cynically,

01:36:20
there's also different terminologies for that.

01:36:22
So people at the high end,

01:36:24
it doesn't really matter

01:36:26
or they're kind of not seen as immigrants,

01:36:28
but these are expats.

01:36:30
Quite often, for instance, in Belgium,

01:36:33
they enjoy quite interesting text regimes.

01:36:35
This is the day this question has to,

01:36:38
whether it would be a nice idea to actually text expats

01:36:46
that's in Belgium. So these are kind of seen as people that bring in a lot of

01:36:53
expertise, a lot of value that make a city very competitive in this global war

01:37:01
for talent whereas people that are for us in the lower paid jobs by seen as

01:37:05
immigrants, right, or foreigners, etc.

01:37:12
Okay, so there's a lot of terms that are being used there that are take part of very

01:37:18
performative and normalizing the situation.

01:37:24
So the way we talk about these divisions matters, I think.

01:37:37
So what we see is also a growth of low-skilled or these skills, migrant workers.

01:37:45
So either people that have middle-ableification in the country of origin and come to a world

01:37:50
of global city or people that have qualifications.

01:37:57
for some reason because they cross the border have lost proof of that. So a lot of

01:38:03
contacts, even if you're educated in one or one in the other direction, you have to

01:38:09
kind of be accredited for that. So you have to, your diploma needs to be certified to be

01:38:15
able to access the labor market in one way or another. In and of itself, it's quite an

01:38:22
interesting process, but it means that a lot of people, especially in informal migration,

01:38:28
not being in the position to actually do that. So they may have all kinds of skills, but they

01:38:34
can't formally use them. So this is kind of the first of these scaling that is going on. Now,

01:38:40
what it creates, especially in the place where you have a wall of immigration, that's typically

01:38:47
world in global cities. It just creates a very large pool of people that have a very poor,

01:38:56
you can say that are not really empowered, that don't have a bargain power to negotiate about their

01:39:03
wages. And if they don't do it well somebody else will. And this kind of the notion of a reserve

01:39:11
army of labor, a lot of people that are in flux that will basically take any job.

01:39:17
And you see in that case, you see the emergence of what people call 3D jobs, dirty demanding

01:39:20
and dangerous or dirty dangers and difficult.

01:39:29
A lot of migrant labor in Roman drug cities ends up in these kind of segments.

01:39:37
And these are typically jobs that people, that kind of the natives, if you will, are willing

01:39:39
to do.

01:39:47
And I mean, Chris, if you look at the whole debate about the fallout of Brexit, it had

01:39:55
been driven tremendously while in anti-immigrant, they are stealing our jobs sentiment.

01:40:03
now that the economy is kind of crippled by not having access to fuel because there's no truck

01:40:09
drivers to actually or migrant truck drivers to actually bring the fuel to to pump stations,

01:40:17
gas stations, where you can refill your car. So it's kind of history with the vengeance there

01:40:24
and it kind of shows the crucial dependence of our economy in a lot of cities on that migrant

01:40:31
and a lot of essential services that is absolutely undervalued in societal terms.

01:40:42
Yeah, and then what is actually quite interesting to see in it's also work by Farskya Susson

01:40:47
when she was still married as Susson Group.

01:40:55
Yeah, a lot of these activities are informal or connected to floating populations, people that are

01:41:05
residing temporarily in cities that may be trans migrants move on when we're not doing.

01:41:11
And yeah, they form the context of, you could say, potential exploitation.

01:41:16
It's not necessarily happening, but it's kind of a context where people that want to take advantage

01:41:20
advantage can more easily do that.

01:41:26
It can be sometimes for very good reasons,

01:41:29
say, OK, I want to help somebody.

01:41:34
And I'll let you lose my house or take care of the children.

01:41:39
And I'll pay you the minimum wage or something like that.

01:41:43
That could be the position of a middle class family

01:41:45
in a global city,

01:41:46
but at the same time,

01:41:48
there's this structural discrimination

01:41:51
of these groups in society.

01:41:54
They may be well suited to take other jobs in society,

01:41:57
but yeah, they're kind of forced into them.

01:42:01
So it's kind of in combination with a large group of people

01:42:02
that are looking for jobs,

01:42:08
the informal character allows a lot of informal potential forms

01:42:11
of exploitation.

01:42:15
And this is what Khos, the parapherilization at the core.

01:42:19
So what she says is that, typically we think about exploitation

01:42:23
as a relation between the global north or the global south.

01:42:25
Actually it's taking place.

01:42:27
It re-enters the global north.

01:42:29
So in rural and global cities, you can also

01:42:35
find this, these exploitative relations

01:42:41
because the global south is actually living in world

01:42:46
and global cities that have raised the relation remains exploited.

01:42:49
Okay, so the racial realization of the core.

01:42:51
Just to figure to illustrate this,

01:42:55
is to refer a little bit to research on this.

01:43:00
So as a whole strand of research looking into urban belief networks,

01:43:05
some kind of interesting work with him Carol looking

01:43:08
at interlocking direct rates.

01:43:20
it's one way of measuring the connections between cities by looking at the overlaps between

01:43:27
the board of directors of board of directors of board of directors. So one member of the board

01:43:35
sitting on different boards. So for instance, for this bunk Belgium and B&D buddy buff

01:43:41
Paris or something like that. And we see actually in this picture there's quite a strong

01:43:49
connection between Brussels and Paris, but it shows that as we live in a kind of global economy,

01:43:56
the corporate world has globalized. There's also the social structure there behind that of a

01:44:02
traveling global elite with a lot of power decision-making power that is connecting

01:44:08
and this kind of place. So if you're a board of directors of, and the board of directors,

01:44:18
ten or 15 corporations, well you will be, you say traveling around in first class between these places

01:44:28
and go from Citadel to Citadel. Okay. I also did a little bit of research into how this looks

01:44:32
and Islamic markets and I found actually quite similar things. The geographies look different,

01:44:40
but what I hope that is how governance structures work is. Islamic banks,

01:44:45
and there you find that next to the typical board of directors,

01:44:52
they also have a Sharia board and these boards basically review and what extent the activities of banks

01:44:59
are in line with the shayya. So are they hollow or are they not a

01:45:00
participant?

01:45:09
It's hollow. And yeah, it's very similar to what I found in the previous figure in the sense that

01:45:16
it's also very concentrated social geography. So it's very concentrated in a very limited set of

01:45:25
scholars, some of them sit on the board, 50 different corporations, which creates

01:45:29
all kinds of interesting things as to to what extent is this so credible that they

01:45:35
will review the share with the compliant character or other things going on.

01:45:44
You see there's a connection with New York. Well at some point, go in sex also was planning to

01:45:52
to go into Islamic markets and there was a whole controversy as to what extends their financial

01:46:00
product was actually reviewed by Sharia scholars or whether this was some kind of a religious

01:46:10
effort, etc. There was a huge lashback by Sharia scholars, by this entire community and

01:46:12
in the end of the materialized.

01:46:15
But just to show you that there's different ways

01:46:17
of approaching these networks,

01:46:20
but it's the existence of those kind of structures

01:46:24
that allows us to understand what kind of activity

01:46:27
state plays at that level and how you can effect

01:46:29
say income structure,

01:46:32
because they're extremely well-remunerated

01:46:35
and will reside in different kinds of places.

01:46:38
Now at the other end,

01:46:59
what I was talking about is these new forms of industrial exploitation in these sweatshops. So yeah, what are these kind of sweatshops? You may have heard of that kind of the renaissance of very old forms of exploitation or industrial organization.

01:47:01
You may have heard about in Middle East,

01:47:07
you have the putting out system where people in the household and in the countryside

01:47:17
were actually producing at a peace-by-peace salary textiles for capitalists and cities.

01:47:22
It's kind of reinvented in the 20th and 21st century.

01:47:26
So, flat shops are these small units, usually underground,

01:47:31
or in secluded spaces, often in a text that industry,

01:47:36
that works through all these kind of subcontracting deals.

01:47:40
So you never quite know who is really hiring people.

01:47:44
So there's different kind of layers of governance there.

01:47:48
And a lot of people, yeah, are indeed paid by the piece

01:47:52
or have daily or weekly contracts,

01:47:56
which is extremely precarious as you may understand.

01:48:01
And yeah, we see that it's kind of the emerge.

01:48:03
And it was, say, the 19th century.

01:48:09
It took place in a lot of industrializing cities.

01:48:13
It went away and, for instance, in the US,

01:48:18
you see that because there was all kind of trade unions,

01:48:23
initiatives, regulations were adapted.

01:48:32
for instance in relation to the new deal just before the second world war, which made

01:48:38
this practically impossible. So it was in a context where you had far less migrant labor

01:48:45
where actually possible to regulate those markets. But as kind of return to the 1990s, this

01:48:53
kind of all of a sudden is back. These are very old data but in the 1990s, calculated I think

01:48:58
between 4500 and 4500, 7000 textile companies

01:49:02
there and then in New York, actually, sweatshows.

01:49:04
So, you think about world's deformation,

01:49:10
it's not just these glitz and glam offices with bankers.

01:49:14
At the same time, it's very old forms of exploitation

01:49:19
that are made possible by complete absence

01:49:23
of any labor rights protection.

01:49:28
So yeah, the places in China down at the lower east

01:49:33
and these kind of situations are still occurring.

01:49:41
Now, then to turn a little bit to I would say criticism

01:49:44
or critiques of the polarization thesis,

01:49:47
because it seems to be a very kind of elegant thesis

01:49:51
right as the restructuring of the economy.

01:49:53
At the same time there's globalization.

01:49:55
It leads to the traction of headquarters

01:49:57
in APS functions.

01:50:00
And this kind of adds to a wider process

01:50:02
of income and professional polarization,

01:50:05
which then they also leads to social spatial polarization.

01:50:08
Because people, but different kind of income groups,

01:50:11
may not necessarily live in the same places.

01:50:14
Quite on the contrary, if they have very different lifestyles,

01:50:16
they may want to live something else.

01:50:23
The same time also the empirical base is mostly linked to a limited set of cases in

01:50:25
York, London, Tokyo.

01:50:35
So especially in 1990s when this became a major debate, the question is is Susson right

01:50:41
or is Susson wrong to put it in the words of Chris Hamlet, who is also one of you sitting

01:50:44
in counterforces in this debate.

01:50:46
So for instance according to Hamnet,

01:50:49
yeah, it's very critical of this full organization

01:50:52
as we also briefly discussed before.

01:50:55
It says, well, it's an all purpose general signifier.

01:51:01
And in the end, yeah, it doesn't really explain much

01:51:04
and we don't necessarily need to describe

01:51:07
what is going on in particular world cities.

01:51:11
So what he says is that next to polarization,

01:51:15
This whole process is thinking, right?

01:51:18
We can think about a proletarianization,

01:51:20
so that's the emergence of, say,

01:51:24
an exploited underclass, if you will,

01:51:27
to use that term in society as the main trend,

01:51:29
or it could also be professionalization,

01:51:33
which somehow refers to social mobility,

01:51:37
the rise of middle income jobs, et cetera, et cetera.

01:51:40
So instead of assuming that world and global city

01:51:44
information necessarily reduces polarization.

01:51:47
It's actually a research question, empirical question,

01:51:50
what is going on in cities?

01:51:55
So rather than just saying, OK, this is a disease

01:51:57
or a given fact.

01:52:01
It may be a hypothesis to see to what extent

01:52:04
we see evidence of polarization or whether we see

01:52:05
other things.

01:52:07
And one thing of doing that is also

01:52:11
taking more into account the occupational structure

01:52:15
and the spatial structure of cities.

01:52:20
So to tell a bit more about this occupational structure,

01:52:21
what it talks about this hamlet,

01:52:24
and this is kind of an interesting evolution.

01:52:30
In the 1990s, he mostly looked at the case of London.

01:52:35
And he says, well, what we find in New York,

01:52:40
I'm not necessarily find that in the case of London.

01:52:42
There's actually very little polarization

01:52:44
what I find is professionalization.

01:52:50
So yes, there's a growth of high income jobs,

01:52:53
but it's not necessarily linked to an explosion

01:52:55
of jobs at the bottom.

01:52:58
So it's not really an hour to us.

01:53:00
At the same time, we also see evidence

01:53:03
of a growth in middle income jobs.

01:53:10
And a lot of people can move up, you could say,

01:53:14
the occupational structure can be trained,

01:53:22
can get a training, and are professionalizing.

01:53:27
So yeah, he doesn't find the pattern of what

01:53:32
seemed to be the two expected pattern of New York.

01:53:33
That same time, he says, well, it could

01:53:42
be related to the fact that migration is there and then far less the case.

01:53:46
It's also incomparable to what you find in New York.

01:53:52
So you had migration obviously to London, but it was less globalized.

01:53:58
It was mostly a link to you can say to the dreadnits of empire,

01:54:02
but it wasn't of the scale of what you found in New York.

01:54:06
And silly says, yeah, there's also a much more general,

01:54:11
well-frest date where you compare it to what you can do.

01:54:15
So let us just, OK, let's not exaggerate.

01:54:17
We don't really find polarization.

01:54:22
Other pathways are actually thinkable.

01:54:28
And then what we actually find in such context

01:54:33
that it might be something that kind of more intersects

01:54:38
with, you could say, process of privilege

01:54:44
that intersects with gender, roles in society

01:54:45
and ethnicity.

01:54:49
So it's less the whole discussion about, yes,

01:54:54
this APS complex that start to transform into a labor market.

01:55:00
Now it's actually wider dimensions of gender and ethnic

01:55:05
languages in society that will explain what we find in labor markets.

01:55:09
So friends as well by Susan, Fangstein, and colleagues,

01:55:17
they look at the exclusion by female labor in high end jobs.

01:55:23
Or friends as the work by John Wilson, John May and colleagues.

01:55:28
If we got one of the first may of the co-author is,

01:55:32
is this okay, look, we have to look much more

01:55:34
at necessity to understand what is going on

01:55:38
because for instance, one third of London's

01:55:41
for the Pina population is actually

01:55:42
in health and social care.

01:55:45
Brazilians are in cleaning services.

01:55:52
Sick are hired as security guards,

01:55:58
majority guards, a jereons are running the metro system, etc. etc. etc.

01:56:04
So, these kind of more general processes will tell us much more about what is going on.

01:56:12
Now, what we find is that when you start looking at more recent work at London, is that

01:56:19
this whole argument that that long as somehow exclude or protect it from processes of

01:56:23
All theization doesn't really seem to hold.

01:56:24
Yep, there's a question.

01:56:28
I'm doing the question.

01:56:31
There are the scores for our game

01:56:36
that was known increased in lower intervals.

01:56:38
They tried to also include one formal,

01:56:43
yeah, the general point or something.

01:56:46
I think that's one of the reasons,

01:56:48
that's a very good point.

01:56:51
And I think that's one of the differences between,

01:56:54
for instance, the work of May and colleagues

01:56:58
and the conclusions by Chris Hamditz

01:57:03
who is focusing on formal occupational structures.

01:57:05
So indeed, that's the first point,

01:57:08
mythological question, is this basically

01:57:10
resolved with the data that is being used?

01:57:13
And actually what you find is that

01:57:16
in the article that was in the reader,

01:57:18
which is a way more recent one.

01:57:22
He also admits that process of polarization

01:57:24
are going on and long.

01:57:26
Okay, so it's kind of,

01:57:29
he has seen the lights, Chris Hemmott.

01:57:32
And that's kind of, yeah,

01:57:33
I just referring to this paper.

01:57:36
It's kind of very interesting paper

01:57:37
because it's really targets

01:57:41
migrant groups here in the sense that they look

01:57:45
at regulation and kind of jobs

01:57:50
that are being done by people that typically are not part of official statistics.

01:57:58
And yeah, it's kind of hard to draw conclusions from that and say, okay,

01:58:00
for instance, if you look at this picture,

01:58:05
this kind of showing the division across different kind of

01:58:17
So they collected responses by over 300 people in informal markets.

01:58:26
Yeah, you find that only 9% actually earns the living wage.

01:58:34
So it really shows that there's an overlay between the environment labor and

01:58:36
or working conditions.

01:58:39
But at the same time, it doesn't give you an overview

01:58:41
of the entire structure of the labor market.

01:58:45
So it's kind of a con-draw systemic conclusion from that.

01:58:48
But if you've seen these compare it to this kind of picture,

01:58:53
which is not about income, but there's about job equality.

01:58:58
So it's a very rough marker of, you can say, yeah,

01:59:02
where in the social hierarchy or occupational hierarchy

01:59:03
are we at?

01:59:06
There you see that there's actually a growth

01:59:09
in the kind of the shitty jobs, if you will,

01:59:16
a stagnation between the drive of normal decent jobs

01:59:19
and a large growth at the top.

01:59:21
So in these kind of indicators that the

01:59:23
with occupational structure,

01:59:27
it's counter evidence towards the profession andization.

01:59:29
So I think what happens here is that

01:59:38
When Chris Hamlet was writing his argument against Sussman in the 1990s, it may have still been true.

01:59:47
It may have been biased by looking at formal statistics, not capturing what was going on

01:59:54
at the bottom because it was basically part of the informal economy. But then even with that,

02:00:01
As time has passed the picture even in the form of market which is no longer lower as he would have described it.

02:00:10
So it's kind of a process of restructuring that has only been initiated later, I think, compared to to North North.

02:00:17
Okay, but in any case, I think it's also not necessarily the same way.

02:00:24
to say, okay, Susson is right or Hamlet is wrong.

02:00:28
Point is that we have to identify different processes

02:00:30
that can actually take place at the same time.

02:00:34
So you can imagine ant polarization and professionalization

02:00:35
at the same time.

02:00:38
It's not because you see polarization

02:00:41
that some segments of the population

02:00:44
actually undergo social mobility.

02:00:46
In fact, it could actually be quite interesting question

02:00:49
in the context of polarization,

02:00:52
who is still able to improve oneself on the labor market

02:00:54
and who is not.

02:00:57
So I think that for me was kind of the gist

02:01:02
of the article by Chris Hamlet's there.

02:01:06
Okay, let me move on because again, running out of time.

02:01:10
So yeah, looking more closely at the occupational structure,

02:01:14
I can't possibly go beyond that,

02:01:17
that it gives you a hint of what to look for.

02:01:19
Second element is spatial structure, right?

02:01:22
So a very important critique principle

02:01:26
is using the same steam is to what extent

02:01:29
are the result of polarization?

02:01:32
It is also a statistical artifact.

02:01:37
There's a lot of focus on cities,

02:01:38
but we at the same time,

02:01:41
we know that middle classes have been suburbanizing

02:01:44
or are still suburbanizing.

02:01:48
So maybe this whole disappearance of a metal income

02:01:50
jobs from cities and the fact that you

02:01:53
end up with a very polarized labor market,

02:01:56
it could be some kind of an artifact.

02:02:00
So yeah, I think that's something to take into account.

02:02:02
That's also quite interesting to compare,

02:02:06
you could say differences between what we did in New York

02:02:09
State versus New York City.

02:02:12
I think you can't say that there's no general trend

02:02:18
kind of in decline of middle income jobs for instance in the case of the US.

02:02:24
But it's perhaps less accentuated than if you only look at the very need city

02:02:30
center. So there's always an impossibility that wealth is suburbanized and

02:02:34
would give you a different question. So scale matters, space matters in the

02:02:39
sense that you have to be aware that you need to kind of map the appropriate

02:02:43
and metropolitan area to turn the stance

02:02:45
the entire structure of the labor market.

02:02:46
Okay.

02:02:49
Now, yeah, and there it can go many ways

02:02:51
in sense that you also have to be sensitive

02:02:56
to what extent you say these higher incomes

02:02:57
will drive gentrification.

02:03:02
There has been a whole process of moving out of cities,

02:03:04
but there's also been a return to the city.

02:03:07
When you take a city like Brussels,

02:03:11
I think I would say, it's around to be a doubt that has been a return of middle incomes.

02:03:17
And a lot of places, really leading world cities, has been of the super rich,

02:03:24
setting a motion process of what Loretta Lee's calls super gentrification.

02:03:31
And just one example of that is, and I refer to that on the map, Brooklyn used to be, you could say,

02:03:41
a nice suburb of New York, just across the river, which was still affordable.

02:03:48
You can put it on these brown stones, but what she described is how actually the top

02:03:56
earners in New York are increasingly buying in these property markets.

02:04:03
So we see that almost half of all Brooklyn was owned by the top 10%.

02:04:11
In that period, you see it tremendous growth and orientation of property values in that period.

02:04:19
So you really have to look at the detailed level within a city how you could say these higher incomes.

02:04:25
Yeah, what kind of spatial process they set in motion and sometimes at least here is a classification.

02:04:29
in a city neighborhoods, and maybe more peripheral processes, etc.

02:04:33
So there's no unified spatial structure there.

02:04:38
It's just a question if we have a structure of the economy.

02:04:41
Where does it specially attaches itself?

02:04:42
OK.

02:04:47
Another example is for instance Brussels, where we find that,

02:04:52
I could say, raw city formation and buses often,

02:04:56
Europeanization of the economy and all kind of functions that are laid to that,

02:05:01
how it has kind of reinforced existing social spatial divides.

02:05:05
And this is work by, and now, a Middle-to-S professor from K.

02:05:13
You live in the discussative group who looked at the evolution of,

02:05:19
you can say, migrant populations and expect populations, sorry for that divide again.

02:05:25
but it's being used in reality in Brussels.

02:05:29
And what you see is that you could say typically the population

02:05:35
with a lower income, the Moroccan population has grown

02:05:44
in the western part of the city area, which is called the Puso

02:05:49
the poor crescent, which is kind of the leading imaginary

02:05:52
there, also with policymakers.

02:05:55
Whereas you can take real Europeanization,

02:05:59
has attracted a lot of expats, mostly Americans,

02:06:04
and other kind of people from the European Union,

02:06:10
mostly settled in the south eastern part of Brussels.

02:06:15
And what Krskastalop explains is that in this geography,

02:06:20
it's kind of reproducing early rounds of division in Brussels.

02:06:24
And then it's kind of no coincidence that

02:06:29
people with a Moroccan ethnicity and the northwest

02:06:33
has something to do with the wider process of migrant labor,

02:06:37
guest labor from the 1950s and '60s.

02:06:45
I can say a lot about that, but the bottom line is, Belgian government actually went to Morocco,

02:06:53
but also Turkey recently to really, you can say, brand Belgium as the place to work.

02:06:58
A lot of migrant workers brought their families.

02:07:01
They were seen as temporary guest workers.

02:07:06
The entities people decided, yes, we were going to build a family here.

02:07:11
And he actually worked in all kinds of productive activities and Brussels.

02:07:16
Who went across the 1960s, '70s?

02:07:23
And so you could say globalization of production also had a huge impact on these kind of jobs.

02:07:29
A lot of these migrant workers were faced with structural employment and were kind of locked

02:07:32
in into these situations.

02:07:35
And yeah, never really got out of there.

02:07:42
So there's still a large unemployment rate.

02:07:49
And what we find is that with the restructuring of the economy, just at the time when

02:07:55
new jobs were being created, there were the jobs that were not really matching the profile

02:07:56
of these casework.

02:08:01
So there was a lot of service work.

02:08:08
Yeah, I mean it's required training which was not necessarily offered to make that transition within one generation.

02:08:14
So that's why you kind of see this kind of pattern reproduce.

02:08:19
So the argument by this cast of all this that we should really look also into

02:08:24
looking at the continuities in these spatial structures.

02:08:31
The friends also find that in contemporary elite geographies of pipe, continuing a little

02:08:38
bit, the work by Chris Castel, but then focusing on the upper stratum, if you will.

02:08:46
We looked at cultural patronage activities, which is basically a method to identify people

02:08:52
doing a lot of money or they think about themselves as being distinct by consuming the

02:08:56
high-end cultural activity. So we basically went to La Monde,

02:09:00
Chapel,

02:09:10
but it's again, Eliza Betz, it is a bit. So you have all kinds of high-brow cultural activities

02:09:15
and Brussels. They've been played. We also went to Buzza, which tried to identify,

02:09:21
who is actually on the big friend list, who is sponsoring this high-end cultural

02:09:23
and cultural institutions.

02:09:27
I mean, these are not kind of super spectacular.

02:09:29
I think sometimes we find it's kind of,

02:09:30
it become a big fan of Bazaar.

02:09:34
I think it was 12 euros per year.

02:09:36
So it's not kind of just,

02:09:37
but it's not the same time,

02:09:40
it's not something that you could spend

02:09:41
on a normal salary.

02:09:45
So you, that was kind of used as a kind of criterion

02:09:48
to kind of find a group that has both,

02:09:51
you could say cultural capital.

02:09:56
also economic. What we found then is that another is actually quite interesting that to

02:10:01
these kind of methods you could actually identify the grid, these people live. We actually

02:10:10
in Buzz and I took our bikes and then the pictures that were actually at the port level and

02:10:15
then the firework where the leads were living. We find kind of interesting clustering there

02:10:22
and it's all very much concentrated in actually in the city neighborhood. So most of the kind of

02:10:31
roads led to this kind of area of the east, Breckman and those kind of areas. So we identified

02:10:38
that our leads are very urban, if you will, and the other place was kind of more suburban,

02:10:45
still within the Russell's capital region with Spipula, which is more like a Vulong neighborhood,

02:10:50
But, and that's kind of distinct way of life.

02:10:53
But it's kind of interesting that the major,

02:10:57
say segregation process that you find in terms of

02:10:59
gave it communities and those kind of things,

02:11:03
this is not something that you easily find in Brussels.

02:11:06
These things exist in Brussels, but it's not,

02:11:11
yeah, it's not the Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro

02:11:12
or these kind of things.

02:11:17
It's really happening by micro mechanisms at the plot level

02:11:21
that this kind of segregation is going on.

02:11:25
Now, just those were just a few examples

02:11:30
to take into account histories of spatial structure

02:11:32
that name matter.

02:11:35
Now, drawing it to a close, I think what I want to say

02:11:38
is that, yeah, how to explain,

02:11:42
You can say inequality polarization, et cetera,

02:11:44
I think we'll let that polarization

02:11:47
is just one way of one outcome of this process

02:11:51
is we need some kind of analytical or explanatory model

02:11:53
for that.

02:11:56
And I want to draw on the work that must be here.

02:11:58
For fun, it's still quite interesting,

02:12:00
because they work in kind of three ways.

02:12:03
It's like, look, there's at the macro level,

02:12:05
a level of global change.

02:12:07
The economy in general, as we structure,

02:12:12
could be financializing this new international division of labor, etc.

02:12:14
So that's happening at the macro level.

02:12:20
There's also at the individual level, due to personal characteristics, choices, etc.

02:12:26
Veterans have its sculptures. You may have different kinds of labor market opportunities.

02:12:34
There's a lot of noise there. It's hard to study in a systematic way, but we need to acknowledge that.

02:12:41
But what is kind of interesting is how the macro and the micro kind of connected by this medium level level of analysis

02:12:46
Because it's kind of the interface between global process and local process

02:12:48
So we can think about how

02:12:52
nicity, gender and those kind of things will structure

02:12:58
Access to the labor market and positionality in the labor market as that labor market is being structured

02:13:01
You have to acknowledge national differences

02:13:06
We talked about the rise of new liberalization.

02:13:09
It hasn't materialized in the same way

02:13:12
or at the same time in different kind of spaces.

02:13:14
There's a large difference still between more,

02:13:19
it's a social democratic or at least

02:13:23
light versions of social democracy.

02:13:29
Winston Continental Europe compared to the UK or the US.

02:13:39
So in continental Europe in many places, there's still white, solid social security system,

02:13:41
minimum wages, etc.

02:13:46
And we kind of identified these are crucial elements in explaining

02:13:52
product for Florida. Oh my god, proof of prioritization is getting laid.

02:13:57
So if you have these kind of security measures in place,

02:14:04
will immediately kind of present at least in formal markets that you have an explosion at the bottom.

02:14:11
So yeah that's something to take into account and also clearly even with a national context

02:14:15
you need to look at the functions and that's connecting back to the new party.

02:14:20
Cities have different kind of functions and that will also shape its trajectory.

02:14:27
If you look at city like Detroit or Charlotte Wab, it's not so likely that these places

02:14:34
role now become leading global command and control centers, okay? Because they don't simply

02:14:42
don't have that economic trajectory. So that's something this positionality in global economic

02:14:50
systems has also been taken into account. Including then I think, yeah, the future, how would it look

02:14:57
like. This kind of freemeling here but it's kind of lightly and you see in the

02:15:03
kind of current developments in cities also a mid-COVID is that it's very likely

02:15:10
that these growing inequalities are only going to increase according to me. You see that

02:15:19
austerity has been sent around in kind of forced. There's a lot of intervention linked to

02:15:22
We call it, there's again a discuss of a strong state.

02:15:29
But as you saw that, you immediately have a lot of official documents that it had to be temporary.

02:15:34
And now you see a return to a kind of discourse that there will be again,

02:15:37
but it's got to be made, so it's a coincidence.

02:15:42
And flounders, we are preparing the ditching from the ditching jump.

02:15:45
So our education is to go digital.

02:15:50
But at the same time, we have to have a budget of 100 million euros.

02:15:54
So, okay, how do you marry those two?

02:15:58
I mean, for sure, those ways to become more efficient,

02:16:01
but at the same time, it's not really credible.

02:16:09
So, nothing really has changed, I think, in this mark-to-narrative of austerity.

02:16:11
So, that's kind of continuing.

02:16:15
And you can say the flexibilization of the labor market.

02:16:18
It's still also progressing.

02:16:23
Okay. It will be different in different kind of contexts,

02:16:26
but it's not really going away.

02:16:30
Migration, as you know,

02:16:35
and this is linked obviously to wider issues such as

02:16:37
global change,

02:16:43
will simply be more people that will have to rely on migration to still make a living.

02:16:50
Rish also means in a lot of cities if you don't work on social security, minimum agents, etc.

02:16:56
You won't do anything about the whole discussion about reserve army of labour.

02:17:02
So these conditions for exploitation will remain in place.

02:17:06
So that's kind of working at a bottom-end, if you will,

02:17:13
At the same time at the top end, and it's kind of returning a little bit to the whole discussion about income distribution to very start.

02:17:20
We see that there's some kind of return of the Gilded Age as the Thomas Piketty calls it.

02:17:28
So a period in the 20th century where, in the 19th century, sorry, where a lot of,

02:17:35
You could say personal trajectories will kind of shape their way where you already come from.

02:17:39
So it's a form of patrimonial capitalism where it matters more,

02:17:44
who your parents are, than what you do in terms of,

02:17:50
I choose this profession or that profession, I work to choose to work hard, etc.

02:18:01
And that means that an increasing part of the wealth is not based on income,

02:18:06
but it's based on other sources of return on assets.

02:18:13
So you see that a lot of groups, when you talk about the 1% of the 0.1%,

02:18:16
their income is not an iteration of labor,

02:18:20
but holding shares, bonds, etc.

02:18:30
So this kind of explains why people that depend on an income from labor,

02:18:33
if there's no real wage increases,

02:18:39
well, you lose out on people that are basically representing capital that are shareholders,

02:18:42
that kind of runs away.

02:18:50
this kind of research by by picked a looking at to the share of the 0.1 so not the 1% but the 0.1%

02:19:01
in the United States Britain, Canada and Australia. We're back in the US at the 0.1 owning 7% of

02:19:12
income, right? So 0.1% of all income in the US. So it's just just try to imagine what that means.

02:19:20
So, and it's an every time you see economic growth and if it's not automatically translated

02:19:26
into an increase in wages, which is obviously a whole bargaining process, you see that

02:19:31
the return on capital increases and that it runs away from real income.

02:19:37
And I think that will be the main discussion, I think, and the post-war era, what you

02:19:43
had, for instance, the US is extremely progressive taxation. The higher incomes were

02:19:50
was taxation of 2.70%. I was considered normal. What you see now in multiple

02:19:53
presidency, for instance, in the US in the US has been relaxed.

02:19:59
So now counter-tenancies, I would say, corporate taxation as a holder

02:20:04
debate about that, or what extent we need to kind of increase that or standardize

02:20:10
that is the kind of multi-level chess game which will be hard to realize but at

02:20:16
least some things are going on there. So I think at the top end I think I mean if

02:20:21
all goes normal there's no social upheaval I think this trend will just

02:20:27
continue and the question is to what extent? To when is this socially feasible to

02:20:31
keep things together or really to really pull apart and political another kind of

02:20:35
I mean you think about cities and then as the final point it means that this

02:20:40
function of cities is becoming transformed as well and maybe this links a

02:20:44
little bit to what that question was just talking about last week is that cities

02:20:52
become basically safety deposit boxes for those people that rely in wealth. You

02:20:56
can think about absentee, baptism, and loneliness, all kinds of neighborhoods

02:21:03
that are owned, for instance, by people from the Arab Persian Gulf that don't live in London,

02:21:10
but just yeah, they don't even bother to rent out parts of night bits or Chelsea because they

02:21:16
don't care because their value of these properties just increases so much that it's irrelevant

02:21:22
whether you rent it out. Another example is shell companies in Manhattan and the Time Water Center

02:21:30
average 30 million for apartments. I think 80% of this case is bought by shell companies,

02:21:35
which is basically trusts within the trust within the trust or whatever. So it's somewhere

02:21:41
the Cayman Islands of the new that trusts that buys these properties, but you never really know

02:21:47
who's behind the shell company. So it's a way to for which individuals and corporations

02:21:52
is the way to do the same property.

02:21:57
You maintain the value of those assets to store their wealth

02:21:59
in places.

02:22:03
And yeah, to add on the final point,

02:22:06
it means that the function of cities is being

02:22:12
done support as holders of value, primarily,

02:22:17
and according to SARS-CoS and the debt, I conclude.

02:22:24
And as a real danger that the process of deprovenization is taking place in these leading

02:22:26
world and global cities.

02:22:30
And the case of absence of an terrorism is a good one.

02:22:32
There's absolutely no life.

02:22:33
Nobody is living there.

02:22:41
It's a kind of pure financial asset or it's an empty tower block where nobody lives.

02:22:46
And it seems to be a very big contradiction because when you think about bustling, bustling

02:22:48
world and global cities.

02:22:52
There's a lot of innovation and diversity, etc.

02:22:54
These are empty shells.

02:23:01
They're at the store, the value and the wealth of very, very, very, very rich people.

02:23:06
And I think it's an issue that we should reflect on.

02:23:10
Okay, thank you.

02:23:13
Thank you.

02:23:15
I hope it was not too depressing.

02:23:20
Or maybe that it is depressing and that we do something about it.

02:23:22
on it? Um...

02:23:25
(mumbling)

02:23:27
(chuckles)



# 4 Urban segregation: patterns and causes

00:00:29
[Music]

00:00:32
I don't know whether there's, I see some people with a laptop,

00:00:36
which you mind to check whether the webcast is working.

00:00:39
Could you click on the link of the link of the live stream?

00:00:45
I think it should be, it should be working I think.

00:00:47
um...

00:00:52
[inaudible]

00:00:59
So, I'm very glad I'm trying to try to do anything.

00:01:23
[inaudible]

00:01:30
And I think that some of you might know me, and many others might not show me.

00:01:41
I am the excurable of these, these class, and the next one, in a trajectory-urban social

00:01:42
geography.

00:01:48
And I consider myself to be as our own social geographer, so that's a good thing I think.

00:01:57
Most of my research has dealt with migration, newcomers in the city, segregation, whiteness.

00:02:04
I've done a PhD with case studies and plumbers in South Africa,

00:02:10
so many years in Cape Town. I've studied how white-milliplast people move through the city.

00:02:17
Now, what's kind of people they get to meet in the city,

00:02:24
etc. So I've done some work on the geographies of encounter, the geographies of migration.

00:02:32
And this year I have decided to work less at the university and to spend more time with my

00:02:39
kids and more time on my bike. I like to cycle. And so it means that I have reduced my workload

00:02:47
at the university. I still have a 50% teaching assignment. I teach social geography in the first

00:02:53
year, Bachelor of Geography. I teach some classes in urban geography. I also take the students

00:03:01
on a field trip to Estonia. This will be the geographers this year. I've also done that for the

00:03:07
master in urban study students two years ago, was the last time I think we did it.

00:03:14
And I'm teaching a course on the city and migration that's a title at the University of

00:03:19
to move. So I have quite some teaching assignments, also supervising some master's thesis

00:03:27
to PhD thesis. So that's what I'm what I'm doing. I've written here in my presenter,

00:03:37
through M.I. and I'm another white male, mid-aged, middle-class man that you get to see here.

00:03:41
I think this issue of positionality is also an important one, especially in the kind

00:03:47
issues that I will discuss when it comes to diversity, when it comes to migration, whether

00:03:53
my experience is in the city. And so I think that's also something important to point at

00:03:59
and something that we could discuss also further in a semester like whether this is something

00:04:06
important or not to you. But there will be not so much time for discussion today. There will be

00:04:12
time for discussion in the seminars and that will come soon and there will also be time for

00:04:18
discussion on the field trips. I'm going to run through two field trips for the students.

00:04:25
This is for the four cities and the master of urban studies students so not for all the

00:04:32
other ones. But we have one excursion to Antwerp and one excursion to Shaldrwa next week

00:04:34
that I'm going to run.

00:04:37
And so I wanted to share some practicalities.

00:04:41
And I don't like the fact that I'm somehow bound to my laptop,

00:04:43
but this is for the live stream.

00:04:49
So let's say, I hope that it's working now.

00:04:52
But so first of all, next week, Tuesday,

00:04:55
I think 40 of you have signed up to go to Antwerp.

00:04:56
Is that correct?

00:04:59
Who will join me to Antwerp?

00:05:00
Yeah.

00:05:05
I will hand out some excursion guides.

00:05:08
I bridge a ton in color by accident.

00:05:10
I don't know how happy the department

00:05:11
will be about that.

00:05:11
(laughs)

00:05:15
If you get these paper copies in full color,

00:05:17
so you can take one if you join me.

00:05:20
Don't take one if you don't join me

00:05:23
because then I will not have enough copies from everyone.

00:05:26
And what is important, and that's something else

00:05:29
that I want to hand out,

00:05:31
is that I'm living in Antwerp,

00:05:36
and so I will meet you in Antwerp railway station.

00:05:39
Great.

00:05:42
To be in one wallet.

00:05:44
Who is joining to Antwerp,

00:05:49
and is familiar with this rail pass or go pass?

00:05:53
No one?

00:05:56
Yeah, some people.

00:06:02
So I would agree to you and I would like you for all the people that joined.

00:06:04
I'm going to bring it online.

00:06:08
And so it says, this is a French.

00:06:11
You can also fill it in Dutch Corimiglish.

00:06:17
The day, Tuesday, the dates in the Belgian system with the month here,

00:06:21
then the place in America, beef that will be Brussels.

00:06:26
and then and you need lines for everyone.

00:06:33
It's a bit complicated because you have tickets for those under 26 and other

00:06:37
tickets for those over 26. A bit more expensive.

00:06:40
So I'll give them to you.

00:06:45
>> That means that you are responsible for that.

00:06:47
>> That's good.

00:06:52
>> That means that you are responsible for that.

00:06:53
>> Yeah.

00:06:55
>> That's good.

00:06:56
>> That's good.

00:06:57
>> Yeah.

00:06:59
>> It's good.

00:07:00
>> It's good.

00:07:01
>> Yeah.

00:07:03
>> I think it's good.

00:07:04
>> I think it's good.

00:07:05
>> Yeah.

00:07:06
>> I think it's good.

00:07:07
>> I think it's good.

00:07:08
>> All right.

00:07:25
So it's important that you meet on time, the 22/8 next week Tuesday we are leaving

00:07:33
a rather early with a train that will have as a destination on Vericund, Nordr

00:07:39
bookum which is a small station to the north of Antwerp but it's important that you get off at

00:07:47
Antwerp in Central. Yeah so the group will meet 740 you take you make sure that you get on the

00:07:56
train 752 and then I and Louise will make sure together with all of you that you have a line for

00:08:04
each students, you get on the train and it will be platform 5 I guess if you're late you pay for

00:08:10
your own ticket. So use let's use that as an incentive. I will not reimburse anyone with these

00:08:17
late. You should travel with the group and then you all arrive at the same time according to the

00:08:25
schedule at 835 and I will meet you on the platform. Yeah so that's what we do. We will go cycling.

00:08:32
I hope that everyone was aware of that. It will, it is November, it will be cold, it will be wet.

00:08:39
So make sure that you bring some gloves and some rain gear because it might, it might be cold.

00:08:45
Bring the excursion guides, especially now that it has been printed in full color,

00:08:50
because we will use that quite a bit. And we are going to discuss basically the topics of the

00:08:56
this class and next class. So we will discuss segregation and social mix in the field in Antwerp.

00:09:05
We will get to cycle about 25 kilometers, that's quite a bit, but it has worked out every year.

00:09:14
Nicely so I trusted it will be the same. We're a mouth mask on the train. I don't know what the

00:09:20
regulations will say how we need to get around in enter. We are quite a big group. I might

00:09:28
split you up a couple of times and bring a lunch or buy one in enter. I will give you an hour

00:09:33
to have a lunch but we will be in quite a fancy part of time so it might be more complicated

00:09:42
to find a cheap place there but not impossible. So you will complete these rail bosses and go

00:09:47
bosses and then you will when you arrive in Enterp, you will give these two to me.

00:09:55
Next week, Friday, I will thank you to Charlotte Wop, or some of you who will join me to

00:10:03
Charlotte Wop. Okay, so a similar amount of people and we will meet in the Brussels railway

00:10:10
station, Central, so that's important. Ten minutes later, but still quite early, at 10 to

00:10:18
eight in order to be on the train at seven past eight. Yeah, again, the same system that say I will be

00:10:24
responsible for the rail passes and the go passes. If you're late, you will need to get in touch with

00:10:28
a fellow student to know where we are. I'm not going to wait for you at the train station in

00:10:35
shall the war, but also you need to pay your own ticket. Okay, and we're going to hike. First through

00:10:43
the city but we will also climb some of these at least one ash heap the riddle in French so this

00:10:50
small mountain of like leftover from the coal mining it is quite steep it can be wet so you should

00:10:58
also have some good shoes that allow you to to do that bring a pen and paper and I will bring

00:11:04
you a similar kind of excursion guide probably in black and white for the

00:11:09
shadow-gawah excursion and you can again bring a lunch or buy one in

00:11:17
shallow one. Do we have any practical questions about these trips? Yeah?

00:11:24
That's a good question. I think in shallow gawah I will end around five, meaning

00:11:30
you can get back to Brussels around six, but I have a habit to give you the possibility

00:11:36
either to get on a train back to Brussels, but I also suggest you to walk back to Shah

00:11:43
Leghua train station. But if you want, you can be back in Brussels at six. From Antwerp,

00:11:48
we will end at six the very latest, because that's the moment when I need to give back

00:11:53
the bikes to the biker until agency. And so that means that you should be able to be back

00:12:02
in Brussels at seven. Some other practical questions? No. And I'm looking yeah.

00:12:12
No you will get a helmet you will get a look. If you're very eager to take your own bike to

00:12:17
enter, you can do it on the train and it's a bit of a hassle but you will get a nice rental

00:12:24
you will get a helmet if you want and you will get a look for the bike as well.

00:12:30
So I will see you next week. I will see 40 of you.

00:12:37
Next week, Tuesday in Antwerp Central Railway Station.

00:12:40
I'm looking forward to that.

00:12:43
So these are the practicalities about the excursions.

00:12:45
I'm glad that I was able to share that

00:12:49
and personally rather than just another message in the town of us.

00:12:52
And today you're not in session one.

00:12:54
You're in session four.

00:12:56
You had an introductory class.

00:13:01
You had two classes on world city formation and polarization

00:13:03
in world global cities.

00:13:07
And basically today we will continue with it on the theme of

00:13:11
class three and I will we will discuss segregation.

00:13:18
We will discuss patterns of segregation and we will discuss causes of segregation and next week

00:13:24
I will discuss effects or consequences of segregation. So these are two classes that fit

00:13:30
very well together and there is a clear theme for each of them patterns causes of segregation

00:13:40
today. Effects consequences of segregation next week. I assume that all of you have read

00:13:47
these two texts. Have you maybe we can also have a look? Who has read these two texts?

00:13:55
Yeah, you can be proud about it. Who has not been able to read these two texts? You can also be

00:14:02
proud about that. Okay, so I see that more people have not read it, not read them rather than read them.

00:14:10
For the discussion seminar, I think it's important that we have like a shared knowledge and these

00:14:15
two texts for this week and the two texts for next week will be the shared knowledge together with

00:14:21
what is being shared in the class. So I hope that all of you will be able to read these two texts

00:14:25
and the two for next week by the time we have the discussion. So

00:14:37
and okay today I have basically three topics. I will discuss first these classical models of urban

00:14:41
form in the text by Pat surely, which was a textbook chapter.

00:14:43
There was a reference to Bergus.

00:14:45
I'm going to talk about Hoyt.

00:14:47
I'm going to talk about Harrison Omen.

00:14:49
Some classical models of urban form

00:14:53
that have been generated by Chicago School Scholars

00:14:56
in the beginning of the 20th century.

00:15:00
Then secondly, I'm going to discuss patterns of segregation,

00:15:03
meaning that we will discuss how to measure segregation

00:15:07
and how you can look at segregation

00:15:11
from different angles. And then at the end of the class, I will discuss some

00:15:19
courses or segregation. Why is it that people live in different neighborhoods of the city?

00:15:25
Why is it that you can find white people in one part of town and people of Black African origin

00:15:33
in another part of town? So this is the topic list for today. And I'm going to start with this

00:15:45
classic a land use model by Bergus. So those of you who have read the textbook chapter by Patchoni

00:15:53
have been reading about the Bergus. He was writing from Chicago in 1925. I think that's important.

00:16:00
I will do the live stream like this. I think that might also still work. It's everyone able to

00:16:02
to give you as a back here.

00:16:03
Yeah.

00:16:05
Okay, so that's going around the world.

00:16:09
So what was Bergus doing here is trying to understand

00:16:12
how cities were looking like?

00:16:15
And what kind of groups of people

00:16:18
that could find in different parts of the system?

00:16:22
And you were stating that basically you had five

00:16:24
concentric rings,

00:16:27
the heart of the city that was the loop,

00:16:33
loop I will discuss that later it's a term from Chicago basically the central business district.

00:16:40
Around that you have to assume a transition that's how it involved it and around in the

00:16:48
queer zone of working, working, math schools. There is a residential zone, a suburban and another

00:16:56
residential zone which is called the community. So five rings around the city. And why was it

00:16:59
and that you have these five rings, well,

00:17:03
because different functions in the city

00:17:05
and different groups of people

00:17:08
were able to pay different rents in the city.

00:17:14
So the theory was that in the center of the city,

00:17:16
the center of this district,

00:17:21
you found, for example, the headquarters of an office,

00:17:25
because they were able to pay the higher rents

00:17:28
that you had so close to the city center.

00:17:33
And third in our main property, that was the theory.

00:17:40
You would find, for example, suburban boats, not very dense,

00:17:43
because these people were able to spend too many less

00:17:48
of rent for their part of the forest.

00:17:54
And so this bit of rent theory was basically

00:17:59
underlying this novel of concentric links on the city.

00:18:00
Yes?

00:18:03
The term model can be a little bit confusing.

00:18:05
And because it could give you the impression

00:18:10
that this is an ideal type like this is how we sit for poop.

00:18:12
But Virgus was trying to do, but basically

00:18:16
to simplify reality and to understand our city's

00:18:20
spur, not necessarily how they open it.

00:18:23
How our cities, and we try to simplify it.

00:18:28
and that's how a simplified version of Chicago

00:18:30
of Western cities looks like.

00:18:36
I told you already written in 1925

00:18:38
and that's very important.

00:18:39
Why?

00:18:42
Because we are at a moment in time,

00:18:47
this is the population of Chicago from 1840 to 2014,

00:18:52
We are at a moment in time 1925,

00:18:56
when this population of Chicago has been growing through

00:19:00
an exponential growth for many, many years.

00:19:03
Yeah, and that also explains why

00:19:08
tourists was making a model of the growth of the city.

00:19:11
Yeah, it's not a model of any city.

00:19:13
It's the model of a growing city,

00:19:15
and you tries to understand

00:19:18
how this growth of the city grows.

00:19:22
both in terms of a growing population,

00:19:26
but also a city that is characterized

00:19:27
by an expanding area.

00:19:31
This built-in environment is grown.

00:19:34
And so it's a level of the growth of the city.

00:19:39
And writing from Chicago in 1925,

00:19:42
well, this is a very particular growing city,

00:19:46
this is a city of immigration, but all of immigrants

00:19:50
from all over the world, but from Europe, in particular initially,

00:19:54
arrived in a very nice settle.

00:20:00
And then you see that in 1900, you have less than 2 million people,

00:20:04
and you need to go only 10, 15 years later

00:20:06
to the five Mother-Mimics people

00:20:08
have to the population.

00:20:12
So this is a fast growing city,

00:20:18
both in terms of population and in terms of the area that is built up.

00:20:21
That's also expanding. That's also true.

00:20:28
It's also a city that is characterized by a Virginia population.

00:20:34
So what you see here is the result of a survey going from house to house,

00:20:40
One thing of people's door and then checking whether there is someone English speaking in white

00:20:48
Irish in green German in purple Dutch in dog furbled Russian in red etc

00:20:51
And so you see that this city was characterized by

00:21:00
Energy in this document all these people coming from different countries for origin arriving in Chicago at that time

00:21:02
So it's a particular city that

00:21:07
Burvis is writing from and I'm saying that because I want to argue that

00:21:09
This theory that

00:21:17
Burvis made up and which he thought was universal for growing cities was in fact a

00:21:21
Theory that was mostly applicable to Chicago

00:21:26
So here you see a couple of assumptions which are also mentioned

00:21:31
in the text that you read or that you're going to read,

00:21:35
the assumptions and principles that were underlying

00:21:40
this theory of the model of the growing city,

00:21:41
the growth of the city.

00:21:44
So you see that the assumption is that there

00:21:47
is this cultural and social effort

00:21:50
to eat off the population.

00:21:54
You can also think of other cities and countries

00:21:58
which are less marked by this kind of diversity.

00:22:03
The second assumption is that there is a commercial industrial

00:22:06
based to the economy of the city,

00:22:11
which you think of other bases to the economy of the city.

00:22:16
What kind of other bases could you have

00:22:18
rather than commercial best show?

00:22:21
Right.

00:22:25
In the horizon, if you go to a city,

00:22:26
that is marked by tourism,

00:22:29
and for example, each stream

00:22:32
could be of any important place.

00:22:35
And a while in a commercial industrial city,

00:22:38
it's in the political center of business districts.

00:22:43
The center of the city is dominated by a touristic place.

00:22:47
Well, many of you would get different time.

00:22:50
I have also saw other time.

00:22:51
as a member of the UN at the other side.

00:22:52
See, find it.

00:22:59
Everything's based, yeah, when you were getting a heritage.

00:23:03
I could also imagine like cities that draw a lot of

00:23:06
deliveries, a religious basis to the city of

00:23:10
Temple or church would be central places.

00:23:13
So you can take off other kinds of cities.

00:23:17
And then the idea of burgers would be that this model

00:23:20
of the group, personal warfare.

00:23:24
Right, ownership or property, economic competition for space,

00:23:27
you can imagine other cities in the Soviet Union,

00:23:32
for example, land and economy, different kind of cities.

00:23:35
And for expanding area and population of the city,

00:23:41
many cities in Europe are nowadays marked by shrinkage.

00:23:49
in eastern Germany, for example, Genova in the thinkability city that has been

00:23:56
marked by Shriepitrofennial on top. Detroit, that will sit in both America, but

00:23:58
that's gone through a similar.

00:24:05
Fifth assumption, transport is equally easy, easy rapid and cheap in every

00:24:09
direction within the city. It's hard to imagine how that would ever be

00:24:15
possible because you will always have transport infrastructure that will allow you to move from one end of the city

00:24:23
which more quickly to another end and to another part of the city. Number five the city center is the main

00:24:30
center for employment and therefore more studyable. You'll also think many other kinds of city

00:24:35
you have for example the airport is an important help and you have a leak and

00:24:41
big developments for rockets. So these things are more attractive because of

00:24:46
differences in terrain. I told you I did my PGD on Cape Town you've got the

00:24:50
Atlantic Ocean you've got table mounted. You can imagine that these differences

00:24:56
in terrain are very important to understand how this city is formed. You have no

00:25:02
concentrations of heavy industry. Yeah, and you have no historic survival of an

00:25:09
burial and your spatter in any district. There is no heritage to you have 19th

00:25:16
century housing or a medieval harvest city. And so, Virgis himself already

00:25:21
acknowledged that it's our techniques to be added, I'm quoting there, that neither

00:25:28
Shikago, nor any other city fits perfectly into this ideal scheme.

00:25:33
Complications in Shikago are introduced by the lake front,

00:25:35
but a lake in Shikago.

00:25:40
And so there is a difference in Shikago River,

00:25:43
another difference in the rain.

00:25:47
Railroad lines, which mean that the transport is not equally

00:25:50
seen rather cheap in every direction.

00:25:54
and historical factors in the location of industry,

00:25:58
in which might mean that you have concentrations of heavy industry,

00:26:00
some parts of the city.

00:26:02
Et cetera.

00:26:04
So you see the acknowledgement that,

00:26:07
well, I'm trying to formulate

00:26:11
a universal model of urban growth,

00:26:17
but underlying my theory are a lot of assumptions and principles,

00:26:20
which make that basically unwriting,

00:26:25
I'm writing up a model of a specific city.

00:26:30
Chicago and basically my model was called for Chicago.

00:26:32
There's not even both for Chicago itself,

00:26:34
because there are many congregations.

00:26:41
I will discuss this further in a bit like.

00:26:48
In urban studies we have been going through a moment where we started to realize

00:26:53
many of our theories are provincial. When we write about gentrification and we make

00:26:59
theory of gentrification, then if we make a case on Brussels then we write a very Western kind of

00:27:06
perspective on gentrification. So it's necessary to deprovinsulize our theories. I find it

00:27:13
interesting that already 100 years ago there was this awareness that, well, me, Burguz, I'm writing

00:27:17
from Chicago and this is important to understand.

00:27:21
So how did this model look like?

00:27:25
I will run through this central central,

00:27:27
most central,

00:27:29
concentric ring is the loop.

00:27:31
Why the loop?

00:27:33
If you ever winch the ideal,

00:27:37
you focus metro lines that all converge in the city

00:27:41
and where basically this whole metro is making a loop

00:27:55
taking back the line from where it's going. So you have these elevators metal track, in a loop, in the shape of a loop. And so that's why the central business is the kind of scope.

00:28:10
So this is the place where you have shopping, where you have offices, where you have headquarters, companies where you expect to find theaters and etc.

00:28:18
etc. Because these are the functions that are able to pay the highest rent, the highest price

00:28:22
for the central one pitch. Why do they want to be in the central location? Well, these are all

00:28:31
functions that need to draw office workers, shoppers, de-entergoers from all corners of the city.

00:28:39
And so for them, it is important to be in the central location that is easy to reach from

00:28:50
everywhere in this. So they want to be in the room. She got on 1925 pictured the

00:28:59
media on IP, busy streets, the first skyscrapers of the world in the city, earlier than New York,

00:29:06
and so we have basically the first city where you have this, I'm just saying that like this

00:29:09
the classical central business district

00:29:11
from the North American town city.

00:29:16
So, so soon, one, the central business district.

00:29:22
Around this, you have the zone,

00:29:24
in transition, the zone of transition.

00:29:30
Basically what you find there is factories.

00:29:33
Why do these factories want to be located there?

00:29:41
They also rely on labor that needs to come in by a trend, by a metro, etc.

00:29:48
So they also want to be in a central location that allows them to bring in workers from all corners of this.

00:29:56
But they are not able to pay these high prices for length, that these functions on the previous slides were able to work.

00:30:03
So we will find a second to bring in which you have these factors.

00:30:08
Not only factories, you also find neighborhoods there.

00:30:12
Who wants to live close to these factories?

00:30:13
Nobody.

00:30:16
This is very poor, you took this very dirty.

00:30:19
These are very bad living services.

00:30:21
So who ends up here?

00:30:24
The first generation of immigrants

00:30:27
from different countries of origin.

00:30:30
Yeah, and as soon as these people are able to force

00:30:35
move to a better part of town than they will do so.

00:30:41
These names that you find on the pictures, little hell,

00:30:43
those quite a bit.

00:30:45
But also the fact that, for example,

00:30:47
here you have little Sicily,

00:30:52
so this is a part of town where this Sicilian is derived.

00:30:55
That was formerly little Sweden.

00:31:05
So you see how one group of newcomers moves out and is followed by a new group of people

00:31:07
from another country of origin.

00:31:10
That was what Berghis was noticing in 1925.

00:31:17
And so this is the part of the Chicago, close to the central business district, close

00:31:26
to do, in the middle of all these factories, where people who just landed off the boat

00:31:32
from Europe and Iraq. And so you have some secret groups, and these are these of new commerce

00:31:42
school Iraq. People who have been able to climb the social ladder, they will move out of these areas.

00:31:54
And they are able to afford a better home, further away from these factories, and they are also able to afford the commutge between home and the world.

00:31:58
So there's also a price to be paid for this.

00:32:05
So, verbus is writing there about the zone of independent European France, who's dead.

00:32:12
And in his vocabulary, respectable working class is living there.

00:32:24
So I found it interesting that I hear six miles northwest of the loop, more west.

00:32:28
So we are moving in that direction about 10 kilometers out of the loop.

00:32:34
You also had an area of Chicago that the family had quite some Belgians living.

00:32:37
And Berghis was also writing about the Belgians.

00:32:39
Many of them were geniters.

00:32:43
So they also had like a specific profession

00:32:46
that many of them were home forms.

00:32:48
And they also had a colloquine.

00:32:53
So you see here, 1921, whole Belgians are equal.

00:32:58
They built a colloquine for Belgians.

00:33:02
Celebrating Belgian-based and Belgian traditions,

00:33:14
We have a St. John Burickman's church, Cynthia and Bechmans in Chicago, and so after the day you can visit the neighborhood that was marked by a Belgian son of the post.

00:33:21
Empathy also has neighborhoods where you had many German or many Russians for many Italians

00:33:27
who had been able to find this social weather and who had been able to out with further

00:33:30
away from these effectiveness.

00:33:36
I have also shown you this map of the survey going door to door.

00:33:42
There was a lot of heterogeneity even in streets that some neighborhoods were also marked

00:33:46
by these ethnic groups.

00:33:49
And then as you go further away from the loop,

00:33:54
you get to more suburban, less dense developments.

00:33:58
Here you see the neighborhood of Mount Prospects.

00:34:02
About 25 miles more west from the loop.

00:34:06
And so we are moving about 40 kilometers out of the loop.

00:34:11
Now 30 to 60 minutes commute to the loop by train.

00:34:16
And so the moment that these trains are being trained lines are being filled,

00:34:18
you see these kinds of suburban developments.

00:34:24
And then you see my prospects 1917.

00:34:27
This is a K-trick of my memory, the 50th.

00:34:29
And this was the ring of the day.

00:34:32
But you also see who is living there,

00:34:36
on the twist, 3D shadowies who have arrived quite early

00:34:39
and were contained like a flying this source of color,

00:34:41
and we'll arrive a little bit on Sweden,

00:34:43
but then we'll move to the so-and-well,

00:34:47
respectable working and its homes as very as common,

00:34:50
but we'll be able to, as they climb to the social weather,

00:34:52
we'll also be able to,

00:34:57
to these suburban developments in bringing forward.

00:34:59
So I have a question about the French private,

00:35:01
and it seems like all of the stuff,

00:35:03
the city of France, but the craftsman,

00:35:06
like it seems like the party is important,

00:35:07
it seems like the French is too.

00:35:08
I'm sorry.

00:35:11
How do you feel that they're rent?

00:35:12
They're a part of it.

00:35:13
Is it revenue, how do you work?

00:35:14
I think the part they have.

00:35:21
Yeah, but you need to see it rent for like you need to pay $12 per stream.

00:35:26
Yeah, and so closer you get to the city center,

00:35:27
the tensor is developed.

00:35:28
We saw it.

00:35:32
And so for that reason, it's not about like what you can't

00:35:38
afford, but how much you are willing to pay per stream.

00:35:42
And so these developments closer to the center are much more dense.

00:35:44
And so that explains why this bitter and poor

00:35:46
is still going down.

00:35:47
Now, yeah.

00:35:57
Virgus, so the concentric zone model.

00:36:03
And a theory that is still being used--

00:36:07
but even today, if you read about newcomers in cities

00:36:11
and neighborhoods of arrival, and people still refer to tourists,

00:36:13
maybe conceptualized.

00:36:17
This arrival of newcomers in Chicago,

00:36:20
and the kind of neighborhoods that they were going through,

00:36:22
as they climbed the social networks.

00:36:29
But you also have other models.

00:36:32
I'm still, before the second world war,

00:36:41
and points another researcher who studied 142 American cities and who stated in the beginning

00:36:49
of his paper that so far reaching are the changes in our population pattern and social

00:36:55
structure that it can well be asked whether theories of city growth and structure formulated

00:37:01
for the private enterprise economy of the late 90th and 20th centuries is now referring

00:37:07
to veriviously would be well be applicable in a future society that may be

00:37:14
of a fundamentally different nature. What happens between 1925 and 1939 in

00:37:20
America? What kind of changes would be so important that you just have an

00:37:24
impact on the model of the world?

00:37:27
Yeah, the depression.

00:37:31
So this is about crisis, a moment of economic crisis.

00:37:32
Yeah?

00:37:39
And when you look at, we'll go a couple of slides back.

00:37:48
Yeah, when you look at population growth and in Chicago,

00:37:52
then you see that this crisis, 1920 by the 1930s,

00:37:58
But this is a clear impact also on the population of shiitaj.

00:38:01
As people are eager to immigrate,

00:38:03
and to a country in crisis, the government

00:38:06
is also more strict on who can come, et cetera.

00:38:11
And so there is a big economic crisis that also

00:38:15
means that there is less migration related to less migration

00:38:17
to the states.

00:38:20
There are also other phenomena.

00:38:25
of white was writing itself, a new theory of civic grade growth made

00:38:30
necessary to fit the effects of a period when cities grow more slowly,

00:38:36
and that's what I told you already, but also when automobiles and airplanes

00:38:42
removed dependency on fixed rails, the car becomes much more important.

00:38:48
You can imagine that a city built for car drivers looks quite different from

00:38:53
city that is built for people to take a tram or a metro or a train.

00:39:00
And he also adds that what is also different is that there's more government control and fixation of high incomes

00:39:05
for the benefit of the poor. This is a graph that sells you something about

00:39:11
taxation of the top income rates in the states. And so you see that this has been going through

00:39:18
going through fights and changes. And as described as when America was hit by

00:39:26
prizes that there was an urge to do it, so we have more texts, more income texts,

00:39:32
these highest power that means is that government can also intervene more in-house

00:39:39
in-game infrastructure, et cetera, et cetera. And so a couple of changes that

00:39:46
is it we have been going through and so what is saying well these models made for cities of a

00:39:53
particular kind remember these assumptions of burgers to not hold true in the cities that I am

00:40:02
studying in the 1930s this 104 cities because we see a lot of different kinds of processes

00:40:07
So, Hoyt came up with a sector of...

00:40:11
... At a sector of theory, saying that,

00:40:15
"Well, you still have this central business district in the city."

00:40:19
So, around this, you do not have a couple of concentric rings,

00:40:21
but you have sectors.

00:40:25
And the assumption is that when the city grows

00:40:29
at each of these sectors, a little growing,

00:40:39
And so if you have to the, in this case, to the east sector in which the richest people

00:40:44
are living, and the assumption is that when these group groups or the population from

00:40:49
the city grows, that this sector will also grow to the east.

00:40:56
And so you have a couple of different sectors, I class medium class, both class, which are

00:41:05
also organized by the transportation infrastructure. So you would have industry

00:41:13
factories concentrated along rivers, allows rain lines and roads. You may at the

00:41:18
next day that you would have both glass residential areas just like

00:41:24
burgers assumed. The burgers assumed that these factories and the lowest

00:41:29
world-class areas would be located in a concentric ring.

00:41:34
And Oric was saying, well, if you look at cities in the 30s in America,

00:41:37
and the sector model comes closer to reality.

00:41:42
So this is a better way to simplify how cities are looking.

00:41:48
So sectors rather than concentric rings,

00:41:52
what is also important is that there's much more emphasis on

00:41:59
and medium-class, low-class, high-class. While Virgus was often writing from these ethnic groups,

00:42:07
Italians, Sicilians, Germans, Russians, Swedish, and people arriving in the city.

00:42:11
And...

00:42:20
Okay, a third moment is the one by Harry's and all, and this is a garage for a

00:42:27
a picture that comes from their paper. We wrote now on the 19th or 25 and you see that in

00:42:33
their paper they make a reference already, just got sent to it. So mobile by burgers. They refer

00:42:39
to the sector theory by Boyd and then they come up with their phone mobile, just got

00:42:47
controlled people locally modeled of the city and you see in date that they have

00:42:52
this kind of jigsaw puzzle that represents the city for them in which you still

00:42:58
find number one essential business district and next to it and next to it

00:43:03
this trick would also a live manufacturing which you also see a couple other

00:43:08
notes that are important to understand the city for example seven and

00:43:16
outline business systems. So this is an important difference between these two models and that one.

00:43:24
There's not just one central business list which also has important business districts in other parts

00:43:33
of the city. For example in London and even in the history, there is an open state. You have this

00:43:39
economic hard of the city, of the city, close to the dollar bridge and you've got a political

00:43:45
heart of the city, close to the westerns there, there is a distance between us to, while

00:43:51
in this traditional bubble, you would expect them to be concentrated, close to each other

00:43:57
in this central business district. They also refer to Chicago, they say there are a couple of

00:44:05
industries or universities which are in very different parts of the city than this

00:44:12
burgers model, quite more, and expected. So then we refer to area of any industry

00:44:18
that I call it, close to the river in the lake. And then also this university of Chicago

00:44:26
for the south of the, which is then again like the hook of an area in which you find

00:44:31
of the military people, the university, the pictures, and people working at the university.

00:44:34
And part of the town where you would not expect that to.

00:44:39
And so they also look at his kind of spice in the big

00:44:44
witrant, saying that well, formerly according to Ferguson, this would always come

00:44:52
down by the further you get from the city center, the lower

00:45:00
is bitter and occur with me. The lower the price per square meter that people of poor companies

00:45:06
or other pensions are willing to fake, but then Aristotle would say, well, you always find this kind

00:45:13
of low spice, for example, local shopping centers, not all the shopping is happening in the central

00:45:21
business district, so you can find these low-risk shopping centers or a satellite city and around which

00:45:23
you fight again like this, the increasing

00:45:26
and the threat force.

00:45:28
So the third model, head is an omen,

00:45:35
where you have multiple, nuclei, more than one center,

00:45:37
basically, and you get this kind of itself

00:45:43
was to simplify perfect force.

00:45:47
In this theory, they upon consider those 10

00:45:50
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:53
Well, in that case, if that's the table,

00:45:54
they work.

00:45:56
Yeah, every city will have a different kind

00:46:02
of form of them in argument that these models are too simplistic.

00:46:04
And not everything is ready, anything from one center

00:46:07
with the practice you will always find, but then one.

00:46:14
So that's why reality looks more complex than in these minutes.

00:46:15
OK.

00:46:23
And why to go back to Chicago, why to go back to theory

00:46:26
that have been written 100 years ago?

00:46:29
I think it's interesting to make urban geographers

00:46:34
of people who are not studies, to make them think about the form

00:46:38
of a system and who is living where they are.

00:46:42
And so on the left, you have cleared a map of Chicago

00:46:49
nowadays and each dot basically represents one person to put the ultimate Detroit

00:46:57
ultimate report, finds maps for other American cities like that and so you see here that

00:47:04
basically the different colors on the back represent different people who self identify

00:47:12
with different racist slash ethnicities. So then making you find people self identify

00:47:19
and the climate is too wide in the year 20 then in blue we find people self-identify this

00:47:26
black in green people who self-identify this Asia and in orange people who self-identify

00:47:30
this Spanish.

00:47:36
In the American context, the race, the ethnicity corresponds very much with class.

00:47:54
And so if you would have a map with socio-economic classes, then you would also find that most of these neighborhoods, which turn out to be a big number of times, where you have a majority of people, so identified as white, so it would be the better of neighborhoods.

00:48:02
And the neighborhoods, with people who self identified, black, could be underprivileged neighborhoods.

00:48:09
So now I question for you which of these models of urban form the concentric

00:48:16
remodel by Virgus, the sector level by wood where this multiple nuclei model

00:48:22
can you find on the mat.

00:48:28
It will not be a lot, so you can find elements of basically all three models

00:48:36
on the map. So when you look at this close, what do you see? Who sees that?

00:48:41
>> For now, when you see a question, it might be a question, but it's too sweet to be a find that's

00:48:48
right out. >> Mm-hm. You find these kind of sectors.

00:48:57
And indeed, I have the Metro Metro Chicago. This will be the central business district.

00:49:02
to have like pieces of pie that start from the central business.

00:49:06
So in the scratch of Chicago nowadays,

00:49:09
it's still looking like for it with a predicted

00:49:12
with these different sectors corresponding

00:49:14
with different population groups,

00:49:16
different socio-economic classes,

00:49:18
low-class, high-class, medium-class.

00:49:21
They use the vocabulary by, by point,

00:49:25
so in these, you can still find that there.

00:49:54
So, what is represented on the map? In these terms, it's considered to be relevant, but yes, so we still make that like also for some reason. We still find it important to do that. But when you look at the pattern.

00:49:59
So I would feel like more of a over-the-contestive

00:50:03
I would say our own focus is about it.

00:50:08
But that's just a bit of a fight.

00:50:13
From the airport, so indeed it's very hard to see

00:50:17
concentric sense, the ring one, because there will be very few

00:50:19
residents of the Central Business District.

00:50:22
It's also hard to spot concentric ring two.

00:50:26
It's also hard to spot some trickering three.

00:50:30
But then when you move further away from the city center,

00:50:33
it's a ring number of four and a ring number five,

00:50:36
where a bird is really expected to better off.

00:50:39
Residents who are blind to social better,

00:50:41
because still see that even today,

00:50:46
these are indeed the places where you find almost exclusively

00:50:49
white, dominated paper roots.

00:50:51
And so this is still the case.

00:50:56
That's what this ring number 4 and 5 are still there.

00:51:00
Every single woman is multiple, quickly.

00:51:07
[inaudible]

00:51:12
Yeah, you can define, so for example, to see an example,

00:51:42
example. It's like his neck, like running, posture, sound. I hear that. Yeah, let the rest of it. I do. I like it. There are two questions. Okay, so in the future I have a cluster of these, I think, people who sell identified as his colleague in the South. And that's around this, a caliber to river. In the street area.

00:51:52
Yeah, you also have a cluster of whites in a sector that is blue, that is dominated by

00:51:55
people who are so identified as black.

00:52:00
And this is this university of Chicago crests.

00:52:08
So up to today, you can still see remnants of this horizon, almond bubble.

00:52:14
And also the reasons why they wanted to refine or give more detail to this consensus

00:52:16
green model and sector.

00:52:18
Yeah.

00:52:25
So I hope that these models make you think about how different cities look like.

00:52:30
And that they also make you aware of well, in different type of cities.

00:52:36
You have different ethnic groups, different socio-economic classes, making up different

00:52:37
parts of the city.

00:52:39
And this can be very different.

00:52:41
And for us also for example,

00:52:44
is a city where poverty is very central.

00:52:49
We have the medieval city, but then when you have

00:52:53
the medieval city, you get to a 19th century government

00:52:55
related to industrialization.

00:52:57
This is where you find the poorest neighborhood

00:53:00
across the spectrum of each world,

00:53:03
and it's just a small Los Angeles.

00:53:06
These are poor districts of the city.

00:53:10
And they are very close to the medieval artists.

00:53:12
You have other kinds of cities, for example.

00:53:15
Paris, where you have much more wealth,

00:53:17
close to the city center.

00:53:20
You have much of the poverty and very peripheral.

00:53:25
So it is interesting to compare differences

00:53:27
and to understand various poverty,

00:53:32
located where do different racial ethnic groups live in the city.

00:53:43
And so when you do that, you will also be able to make a simplified model of the city that you are familiar with,

00:53:45
the city that you want to study.

00:53:52
And you will also come to an understanding that this work is on point and there is an open bubbles are very simplistic.

00:53:59
And that in different countries, in different cities, you would have very different models.

00:54:01
And I have a couple of examples.

00:54:06
This is one from Kiausli that is also used in the textbook.

00:54:11
But you have in the British context, these council estates.

00:54:13
Yeah, built on peripheral land.

00:54:17
And so in a concentric ring where Ellis,

00:54:18
and

00:54:22
Burgess would expect private suburban housing,

00:54:25
you also have these council estates, just

00:54:28
like these volunteers in the French context.

00:54:31
very much of the poverty is horrifically,

00:54:35
while that contradicts a burden.

00:54:40
The Chinese city,

00:54:42
was ever a bird of the Cheng Cheng

00:54:45
truth, my pronunciation will become a bird.

00:54:48
Cheng Cheng,

00:54:56
nobody said this in China, also fast-growing.

00:55:02
In China, you basically have a noodle or an urban citizen.

00:55:06
The Google system, probably the third.

00:55:15
And you have villages, which were taken up by farmers,

00:55:17
which are noodle pieces of land.

00:55:20
And you have people with this noodle citizenship,

00:55:22
with the noodle living.

00:55:26
When people from the countryside migrate to the city,

00:55:31
they are able to take up residence in these old villages.

00:55:34
And because then, who took this citizenship

00:55:36
you might make, say it like that,

00:55:39
allows them to stay in this area.

00:55:43
So you have a many Chinese cities,

00:55:45
parts of the city that I look like that,

00:55:49
where you have a very formal part immediately next

00:55:52
to a part of the city that looks much more informal,

00:55:57
much more dense. And that's because when the city grows over this countryside,

00:56:04
that these rural villages from the past become these religious in the

00:56:09
city where they have a lot of newcomers arrived. And so in these Chinese

00:56:14
cities, the model of the Chinese city, we've looked very differently from

00:56:22
because you have these areas that used to be villages or centres of villages,

00:56:29
where you have people with emigrating from countryside, from other parts of China,

00:56:31
who arrived there.

00:56:37
So this change from true, I think it means something like village in the city.

00:56:42
And these are areas that I was just talking.

00:56:50
The African city, the play of a whole pro-life in 62, very different again.

00:56:54
Because transport is much more complicated, is African cities.

00:57:00
So, bridge people refer to the close to the cities and the poorest of them who are

00:57:04
right from the countryside will arrive at the very ends of the city,

00:57:09
and very peripheral locations where it takes you two or three hours to get to the south.

00:57:14
So this city is looking different again.

00:57:20
My Davis, Los Angeles, you might have heard of the Chicago School, Burbs, for example,

00:57:26
that you might also have heard of Los Angeles, who of course modern photographers riding

00:57:27
across Los Angeles.

00:57:34
And my Davis, and who wrote an interesting book in 1992 and tried to make the 1998

00:57:41
for me, a model of how people's angels look like in the night.

00:57:47
And you might have heard of Skit Row, this part of the city,

00:57:51
there's thousands of homeless people living on the street,

00:57:54
just next to the central business district of Los Angeles.

00:58:00
So this is the song of transition, and this is where the poorest of the poor live,

00:58:03
He needed the next to the central business.

00:58:06
But you also had a pet bike,

00:58:11
these gated developments at the periphery of the city,

00:58:16
where he had the richest of the rich living in these gated suburbs.

00:58:21
I'm sorry, you could also see that, basically, these borders

00:58:25
between the different drinks were being walled, fortified,

00:58:27
that is anchorage in the city.

00:58:34
So you're trying to make a mobile of Los Angeles in the 1990s.

00:58:44
Mark Vage's desperate poverty, some parts of the city, and then also this fell in other parts of the city.

00:58:48
And in the end there's still a lot of burgers in the small.

00:58:56
There's still the central business district, there's still the Corro, and there's still this forest of the poor living community next time.

00:59:01
in the zone of transition between mixed the factories and this little hell

00:59:07
or little system, but people living with the streets. And I'm not more able

00:59:11
out of this at the center of the rich earth, it's never good to get. It's also

00:59:18
very much good. So trying to make a follow up, Los Angeles, in that

00:59:19
that I did.

00:59:23
I'm also a little touchy.

00:59:24
Sorry.

00:59:25
Thank you.

00:59:28
Yeah, I-- one hour ago, I took out

00:59:29
the slides with a couple of four

00:59:34
telling-- again, trying to understand, for the post

00:59:39
socialist city and wood light, but then also using

00:59:41
ballot as an example, but also trying to understand

00:59:46
what kind of problems do we see in these socialist cities

00:59:48
and then in these post-social cities.

00:59:52
and how can we try to generalize the simplify.

00:59:55
And so that attempts to make a low is an attempt

00:59:59
to simplify reality and to try and understand

01:00:02
what this particular about cities.

01:00:06
And what makes Los Angeles different from Chicago

01:00:08
in 1925.

01:00:12
So you also have indeed puzzles for European cities.

01:00:14
This was a British city.

01:00:19
curiously in this council estates that you could also make a model for a

01:00:22
stuck hole and try to think like what the specific of a stuck hole

01:00:28
I understood the problem from better to all the cities and then we're like general models

01:00:35
by I think it's not because I'm so in there by the general one

01:00:39
I think not that I know because this this

01:00:42
This event has been like a special fashion of American events.

01:00:48
And indeed, you could think how these assumptions that burgers some that are that I have

01:00:51
some not only slide in it, finally fixed.

01:00:57
But there's some of them are, are, uh, actively European.

01:01:02
Like for example, this idea that there can be an early on energy, so your peak city

01:01:05
is then to have a long history.

01:01:08
So for that reason there are always parts of the city,

01:01:12
and to always something to have a growing city,

01:01:17
in a sense area, so you always have 30 land users

01:01:20
and you have a history of the city.

01:01:26
There's also much more state intervention in Europe.

01:01:28
So we could think like how European city

01:01:32
would be different from these assumptions or burgers.

01:01:36
I want that with me that for the mother-world.

01:01:39
I have found that, but it could be an interesting--

01:01:42
it could be an interesting exercise.

01:01:45
Good thing how it is, what makes--

01:01:48
what is particularly European out of the city?

01:01:51
And is this something like it?

01:01:52
I just told you that the rest of them

01:01:54
took different from Paris.

01:01:58
It was just two hours, so I'm not allowed by three.

01:02:03
So it might also be possible.

01:02:05
So I think it's like our idea of what we did

01:02:09
to know when we studied college for dinner

01:02:10
with joint comedy, why is there--

01:02:12
because I think alumni are going to be

01:02:15
in this three days, only last time

01:02:19
in the built-in scenario.

01:02:20
Since then, there's three for all.

01:02:22
Like, what will happen?

01:02:25
I know there's so much projects through your sewing states.

01:02:27
And I assume that, for example, when

01:02:31
the nervous was making up the model in front of the body.

01:02:34
That's almost less strict and less regulated.

01:02:35
And it is non-dicks.

01:02:39
And when you're also in you have a city that is growing that fast,

01:02:46
that is having 1 million extra inhabitants in the very short period of time.

01:02:48
And then the city grows fairly organically.

01:02:55
And then it's also very hard as a planet to be put with the base, but the city is growing it.

01:02:56
but I must have been in the eye.

01:03:00
Don't know so much about song in regulation.

01:03:03
When exactly it must become a state.

01:03:12
I'm gonna mention the problem with the questionnaire

01:03:14
and the single that--

01:03:17
Uh-huh, okay, and can you read it?

01:03:18
Or not to know?

01:03:22
So I said that to, well, I will ever look

01:03:24
whether I can I can see.

01:03:29
Okay, I see some comments.

01:03:29
Yeah.

01:03:32
In the example from China,

01:03:34
how does the ownership of people of these states

01:03:36
where is the city grows over these villages?

01:03:45
Okay, I will,

01:03:48
I will, it's time for a break.

01:03:49
I will have a look at it.

01:03:52
I will have a look at what I find in public borders

01:03:59
It's hard for me to check this livestream that also, I also need to get out of PowerPoint to check that.

01:04:05
I'm teaching most important people here and I hope that the livestream first.

01:04:10
I'm going to say 5 minutes break. It's 4 past 6.

01:04:15
On my clock here, so let's start again 9 past 6 or 10 past 6.

01:10:14
I'm just going to put it on my hand.

01:10:19
[inaudible]

01:10:26
All of those issues are like

01:10:56
[inaudible]

01:11:03
[ Inaudible ]

01:11:12
[ Inaudible ]

01:11:17
I have lots of slides with a conclusion for the first

01:11:24
So I will be asking if I will show you, let's go through it.

01:11:31
It seems there's urban differentiation, like that bridge, and four of them are the

01:11:32
neighborhoods.

01:11:38
There are people from different ethnicities, different generations of view colors that

01:11:40
they live in different neighborhoods.

01:11:45
somehow it seems to be some characteristic of most different whole cities.

01:11:48
I've been showing you a levels grow.

01:11:57
Africa, Los Angeles, Chicago, United Kingdom, and I've been talking about this model of

01:11:58
socialist or socialist.

01:12:04
It seems that in each of these levels there is this idea of different groups of society

01:12:08
and whether you define them in social economic classes

01:12:11
or different ethnicities or some of identity

01:12:15
by race, but these different groups

01:12:17
take a different part of the city.

01:12:22
And it also seems that different local features

01:12:25
impact of a permanent forum.

01:12:27
For example, this link in G.D.

01:12:30
I hope you could see that there are references

01:12:33
to the wins direction in some of these models,

01:12:35
migration, patterns, etc.

01:12:40
And obviously also local policies and transport system.

01:12:43
Stay in the region in housing,

01:12:44
desire B, for example,

01:12:48
the Scouts of the States for the body use

01:12:50
and the pre-career city.

01:12:55
And restrictions of mobility in the Chinese context

01:12:59
of the system determining where to live

01:13:02
or where you could set your kids to school.

01:13:04
strategies to counter the hypothesis.

01:13:08
So that also means that most of these models of urban form,

01:13:12
even if they say this is the bottle, the American city.

01:13:14
But they somehow wear bird marks that they are situated

01:13:18
in a specific space in a specific time.

01:13:24
The model of Chicago for 1920s was a model of the growing city.

01:13:27
And with this already 10 years later,

01:13:31
when this American economy has been hit by crisis,

01:13:32
is modeled with not all true anymore

01:13:36
because the city was not growing at the fast pace.

01:13:39
And so it's always about situating these models

01:13:41
in time and space.

01:13:45
And so that also makes it necessary to provincial us

01:13:47
at the theories about it.

01:13:49
Oh, great.

01:13:51
And I like to show you some exact questions

01:13:58
to make you think like how will I ever make you--

01:13:59
like what kind of questions could you

01:14:03
you straight from this and this is a question that I've asked for in 2016.

01:14:08
You have the model on the side African, both of our state city,

01:14:11
by a particular author and then all our familiar,

01:14:13
all of you are with this studio fund.

01:14:15
Apart from that, so let's recap,

01:14:17
repeal of this, Apart from that, also.

01:14:20
Ateez, Nelson Mandela.

01:14:22
Right.

01:14:26
So you have some references to this legend.

01:14:31
And then I asked you which elements of variousoids and errors of the

01:14:34
Do you recognize in this model?

01:14:36
What about that?

01:14:37
Sit.

01:14:43
That's really a way to check whether you understood what these models are

01:14:44
about.

01:14:48
You're able to apply that to another one.

01:14:49
Yeah?

01:14:50
>> I was touched.

01:14:51
>> What are we doing?

01:14:54
>> Don't anyone have to take time?

01:14:55
>> Yes.

01:14:59
the following model.

01:15:02
They have, I found it in a book that I don't remember,

01:15:04
which is perfect.

01:15:07
They should ever look and know I don't.

01:15:09
I can look at it.

01:15:12
I don't know if they'll do the thought.

01:15:16
I can tell you also the thoughts.

01:15:22
So first, our these classical models of perfect form,

01:15:25
but also some more reasons

01:15:30
and place with several models.

01:15:33
But I'm going to discuss now with patterns of segregation.

01:15:40
How can we look at segregation in cities?

01:15:45
And I will use the definition by two American authors

01:15:49
again, Messi and Beno Duchs-Smesi,

01:15:53
and Nancy Netton to America's sociologist,

01:15:56
who wrote a book called American Apartments.

01:15:59
So you see this reference to the silent written signals.

01:16:01
But in the thinking on segregation,

01:16:04
this book has been quite important.

01:16:08
And so you see here, what is the definition?

01:16:11
First of all, they focus on the residential segregation.

01:16:15
I could also discuss segregation in leisure spaces.

01:16:18
how many people who play sports or the places

01:16:20
where people spend their leisure time,

01:16:25
how we are desegregate, or I could look at work segregation

01:16:29
to people of different socioeconomic losses

01:16:33
meet each other on work, but most of the work

01:16:37
on segregation focuses on residential segregation.

01:16:39
What is residential segregation?

01:16:42
It's a degree to which two or four groups

01:16:49
of every unit, find it, this separately from each other in different parts of the urban

01:16:55
confiring. And that's the decision. Now what you see in these models that I'm going to show you

01:17:06
in the previous hours is that in most cities, different groups that you find them in a social

01:17:14
economic rate for this ethnicity, race, self-identifying,

01:17:17
that indeed in all of the cities,

01:17:20
different groups to live in different parts of the city.

01:17:23
That's all within each of these cities,

01:17:25
where this model is.

01:17:25
Eight.

01:17:30
It would make sense to look at residential segregation.

01:17:32
As a more, is the messy and dense one

01:17:35
to make this a little bit more complex?

01:17:38
And they say most of the research on segregation

01:17:40
has been too senseless because it looked at segregation

01:17:43
in one particular way.

01:17:46
And so what I'm going to do with you now

01:17:51
is to look at, for this, just five dimensions of segregation.

01:17:55
For messy and then, these are called evenness, exposure,

01:17:59
concentration, centralization, and plustery.

01:18:02
And also the research on segregation

01:18:04
is discussing evenness.

01:18:07
So I'm also to look at it.

01:18:10
What is evenness?

01:18:15
Evenness refers-- and I'm just reading what you see on slide now--

01:18:18
refers to the differential distribution

01:18:24
of two social groups among aerial units in a city.

01:18:28
So a minority group is said to be segregated

01:18:33
if it is unevenly distributed over aerial units.

01:18:37
Evenness is not measured in any absolute sense,

01:18:40
but it's scaled relative to some other group.

01:18:44
So we are able to save in this city.

01:18:46
This is the example that you see there.

01:18:50
Lights are segregated from blacks.

01:18:55
Or the low socioeconomic losses, if you may call it,

01:19:01
same like that, are segregated from a high socioeconomic

01:19:08
bridge is segregated from. So you always need these two groups. So you see here that you

01:19:19
can have index, here is this here, and index of this similarity can be calculated. And

01:19:26
I will give you two examples. Some years this goes out of the realm and sometimes this

01:19:33
goes wrong. Imagine that you have a city that is made up of four districts. And in each

01:19:50
of these, you have 75 whites and 25 whites. What would be the index of this similarity

01:19:59
When I use the measure layer, we need to take half of the sum,

01:20:02
that is what this great sigma is being.

01:20:05
And now we need to, for each of these neighborhoods,

01:20:10
we need to say what is the length of relation in an area.

01:20:16
If I just write total length of relation, 25 to 5, 100,

01:20:24
minus 75 the white population in area 1 divided by the

01:20:26
social white population.

01:20:31
What do we have here for one neighborhood?

01:20:33
Zero.

01:20:34
Yeah?

01:20:38
And it would calculate the sum for this measure for each of

01:20:41
these neighborhoods so that there will be zero,

01:20:47
a 0, 0, 0, 1/2, 0, 0.

01:20:54
The index of this similarity would be 0, or 0%.

01:20:59
This corresponds with the fact that you need to move 0%

01:21:03
of the population in order to get an even distribution

01:21:05
of white and black across the city.

01:21:08
Because you have an even distribution.

01:21:10
In each of these four neighborhoods,

01:21:15
You have as many whites as you have in other parts of the city.

01:21:21
And you can also look at another example,

01:21:26
where you would have 100 legs living in one neighborhood,

01:21:33
100 whites in another, 100 whites in another,

01:21:35
and another 100 whites in another neighborhood.

01:21:39
And if you would make the calculation now,

01:21:42
and you will get to one, not going to do the computer,

01:21:46
but for those who are able to do this,

01:21:48
this means the absolute number of this.

01:21:50
So if you get to a negative number here,

01:21:52
then it comes closer to the end.

01:21:55
When you calculate that, it will be,

01:21:58
then the number will be one.

01:22:00
Yes.

01:22:02
And because you will, again,

01:22:03
so do that with you.

01:22:07
This is a sum of 100, the number of price

01:22:12
in the first neighborhood minus 100, the total number of x,

01:22:16
minus the number of y's in the neighborhood zero,

01:22:17
and 500, 100, 300.

01:22:22
And for each number, each of these neighborhoods,

01:22:26
you will get to the number one,

01:22:30
and here you will get one, third, one, third, one, third,

01:22:33
total two, half of two, one.

01:22:37
Meaning you need to move 100% of the population

01:22:42
order to get an even distribution of these population groups across the city. Either you move

01:22:52
33 flecks from this neighborhood to this neighborhood. And then you can get if you move 33

01:22:58
to each of these, then you get an even distribution of flecks across the city. Or you move all

01:23:03
the white people to that black neighborhood. And then you would also get to the reason this

01:23:07
some people across the city, according to this neighborhood.

01:23:11
And so there's an index of this singularity,

01:23:15
range is from zero, even this distribution

01:23:18
to one fairly uneven distribution.

01:23:21
And basically, in corresponds with a percentage

01:23:23
of people that you would be moved in order

01:23:28
to get an even distribution of people across different neighborhoods.

01:23:30
And so this may be complicated,

01:23:33
But you can just look at the practice.

01:23:34
So how does this look like?

01:23:37
You would get to a number.

01:23:38
This is this percentage.

01:23:45
And what you see here, for example, is that--

01:23:49
so 0 was an even distribution.

01:23:54
But this example, Y_hunder, very uneven.

01:23:58
And so the more you look at the prides on this slide,

01:24:00
more uneven disease are.

01:24:02
So what is particular is that you see,

01:24:05
as first of all, American cities tend to be much more

01:24:08
unpleasable than European ones.

01:24:13
Yeah, so segregation, when you look at the dimension,

01:24:18
evenness, then you find out that in American cities,

01:24:22
the poor, for example, are living much more

01:24:25
in particular parts of the city.

01:24:30
in the European context, they are a bit more spread across different parts of the city.

01:24:40
And so you see here for different cities and for different population groups, you see how this has been

01:24:46
done. And again, you always need to compare it with another population group. So what is done is

01:24:50
the poor of Edward compared with then the ones who are not considered to be.

01:24:59
And so it's also interesting for those who joined into M-Turk to see that according to these

01:25:10
statistics, poverty in M-Turk in 2005 was also much more unevenly strengthened across the city.

01:25:17
So you had particular neighborhoods where you had that were marked by poverty much more than in

01:25:26
other European schools. This also is scale-ish Belgium and in a very small statistical sectors

01:25:33
that's a part of the explanation. Scale is important, but these sectors grow. They will mask

01:25:38
some of the concentrations of poverty of health that you get in this at least 60 to the

01:25:54
or defined. So this measure of evenness, yeah? So more numbers, again you see that 90,

01:26:01
and so you get close to 1, Birmingham Bangladesh, I read there, "All time Bangladesh,

01:26:08
called the Bangladesh. So apparently this Bangladesh sheet in UK cities are living very much in

01:26:15
particular neighborhoods of the city. And in these neighborhoods you would find almost exclusively

01:26:22
by much and that explains why you would need to move almost all these Bangladeshic or other

01:26:28
neighborhoods if you would like to get to an even distribution of Bangladeshic in UK cities.

01:26:35
And so you see how this measure is being used in order to say something about residential

01:26:41
segregation in these different cities.

01:26:50
Poverty in Copenhagen, the first quintile will be like the first 20% of the people according

01:26:58
to the income distribution is much less segregated and it spreads much more evenly across

01:27:05
the sick and is in all the other cities that are missing there. So do you understand what

01:27:14
is measure of evenness and evenness means? Yeah? Okay. I get now to these four other

01:27:19
dimensions. So what Messian and Desmond are arguing is that we have been looking at

01:27:25
segregation, goes through this lens of evenness. There are also four other dimensions,

01:27:28
which are worthwhile, I will leave it.

01:27:29
That a question.

01:27:31
Oh, I would sort of make for an honest example,

01:27:35
with the one hundred black residents in one end,

01:27:38
and then the two-second, right, I didn't say,

01:27:42
what does it, what does it need for if you want there,

01:27:45
for the, for white residents in one second,

01:27:47
and black residents?

01:27:51
Or did I need to put that on? - Well, I'm just,

01:27:53
I am just for each of these neighborhoods.

01:27:59
I am calculating, I didn't want to grow too much into this.

01:28:02
I am calculating this.

01:28:06
And I start from the black neighbor roots.

01:28:09
Their measure for the number will be 100 divided

01:28:13
by 100 to the total number by minus the neighbor

01:28:16
within our zero whites divided by total number

01:28:17
of whites to be 100.

01:28:19
That will be one.

01:28:21
For the white neighbor roots,

01:28:25
and I have three of them. The measure will be there are zero

01:28:30
of legs and I have minus 100, the number of whites in that

01:28:34
neighborhood divided by the total number of whites 300.

01:28:38
Yeah? So I get here to 1 divided by 3, 1.

01:28:46
And so I get 1 plus 1/3, 1/2 plus 1/3 plus 1/3, 2

01:28:50
divided by 2, 2.

01:28:53
But it doesn't say anything about these neighborhoods.

01:28:56
I'm calculating something at the scale of the city.

01:29:01
And for that, I need to calculate this measure for these four neighborhoods.

01:29:04
>> Okay, you can add on this.

01:29:09
>> And then I think I realized I know how to do it.

01:29:15
>> And then I need to make the sum of this number in each of these.

01:29:24
So that will be sum of 1 plus 1/3 of 2.

01:29:30
And I need to be vided.

01:29:32
But that's 1.

01:29:37
But the index of the similarities is 1 in this case.

01:29:44
100% meaning that either 100% of x or 100% of y's

01:29:54
need to move in order to get to an even distribution of both wide sunwax across the seat.

01:29:57
Okay.

01:30:00
Four other, yeah?

01:30:22
[inaudible]

01:30:29
Yeah, that's the percentage. So then this would be 100, and this would be zero. And if the index of this

01:30:34
the same level would be 0.5, then you would have 50%.

01:30:36
And that would be 50.

01:30:42
And so you move close to one, and you are close to zero.

01:30:46
But this is a measure that you would often find in the loop,

01:30:47
in the loop.

01:30:52
And it would also be often checked like our segregation

01:30:55
changing across time.

01:30:58
And it would be the index of the similarity

01:31:07
first hand work has moved from 0.40 to 0.6 in an equal dot order concentrated over time.

01:31:12
Or more say you need it. Sorry, I'm not using it because more say good.

01:31:22
So I got less evenly distributed across time. Okay, for other dimensions I'm going to move

01:31:24
to them rather quickly.

01:31:35
There's a potential exposure, which first is the degree of potential context or the possibility

01:31:37
of interaction.

01:31:44
In this case, in each of the neighborhoods, there is a similar degree of exposure.

01:31:49
The other is when these people limit their lives to the neighborhoods, there will be no

01:31:59
approaches. So this degree is fairly close to evenness but not completely because for exposure

01:32:07
and the number will also be depending upon the total size of these communities. If the total

01:32:13
black population in the city is very low then the chances that you will get to meet a black

01:32:16
a person are lower already.

01:32:19
And so the size of the group is important if you would

01:32:24
make a measure for exposure.

01:32:26
Concentration, dimension number three

01:32:29
refers to the relative amount of physical space

01:32:33
over five by a minority group in the urban environment.

01:32:38
So again, it depends on the size of this one.

01:32:40
3F here in Haton.

01:32:42
And we have been these different colors

01:32:45
again, these different ethnic or racial groups,

01:32:50
or people self-identifying with a particular group.

01:32:54
And so you see that in shades of purple,

01:32:56
you have the Asian population.

01:32:59
And so you have China,

01:33:04
and that's where most of these Asians are concentrated.

01:33:07
They take up a very small amount of space.

01:33:09
This is a dense neighborhood.

01:33:16
most agents living in Manhattan or living in that particular part of Manhattan.

01:33:24
So concentration, the relative amount of physical space occupied by a minority group.

01:33:28
Number four, center of the city.

01:33:33
It relates to the creed to which a group is spatially located near the center of an

01:33:40
I don't know what the center of New York would be, but if you say it's Wall Street, then these

01:33:43
Asians are living very centralized.

01:33:52
And while like Africans in the case of New York are not living central anymore.

01:34:01
The same goes for this example of poverty. In Brussels, poverty is very much centralized.

01:34:06
these neighborhoods which are marked by COBRT are close to the city center.

01:34:15
In the Parisian days, 40 is very much decentralized. That's much more an issue of these peripheral

01:34:26
volunteers. And in the last dimension is clustering. The degree to which these aerial units

01:34:34
inhabited by minority members and join one another or not. I don't know how familiar you are

01:34:41
with New York, but I remember walking out of the metro station in Flushing, close to Flushing

01:34:47
Meadows where you have the tennis tournament and that was another neighborhood and that was

01:34:51
was very much marked by a presence of Chinese people.

01:34:56
Yeah, the Soviet have clusters of,

01:35:02
at least two clusters of agents, one in this China attack,

01:35:05
an attack, and another one somewhere here in Russia.

01:35:11
Yeah, and so is the presence of agents,

01:35:15
is a cluster, no, because there are two neighborhoods

01:35:18
which are quite far away from each other.

01:35:24
Even this exposure,

01:35:30
for the centralization, concentration, cluster.

01:35:34
And so I could also ask you in the exam

01:35:40
to discuss the three most relevant dimension

01:35:41
of messy and messy,

01:35:43
or the ones that you still remember.

01:35:51
to these five to discuss social economic segregation process.

01:35:54
Is over the Western or not?

01:35:57
Is it centralized or not?

01:35:59
Is it concentrated or not?

01:36:01
Is that even the same?

01:36:08
And the data might allow you to say something about it or not.

01:36:13
I already told you when I pointed at these high numbers

01:36:18
of unevenness in entered, that scale is fairly important.

01:36:24
So now here this is a pattern of rich and poor

01:36:29
and you will only detect it as segregation

01:36:33
when you are able to study it at the scale of these

01:36:35
specific neighborhoods.

01:36:38
And if your statistical units are this big,

01:36:43
then it would be, then this would be of any events

01:36:51
you're able to study it at this scale, then this is a very uneven. And so the more refined

01:37:00
these statistics allow you to grow the higher one with assume these levels of segregation or even

01:37:09
this unevenness will be. So scale and the scale through which you look is something very important

01:37:15
this one. I saw a hand somewhere at the bank and I'm only with the discretion for the relevant death.

01:37:40
[ Inaudible ]

01:37:45
Well, I could imagine, like, some already have a CBD.

01:37:49
And we have four neighborhoods around the CBD,

01:37:51
part by poverty.

01:37:55
And you would say that poverty is centralized,

01:37:58
but it's not clustered.

01:38:00
And it is also-- is it concentrated on it?

01:38:06
The role of this amount of space and a less

01:38:13
They are related to each other, but there is still something visiting about the digital

01:38:17
associations of poverty, which are very decentralized.

01:38:24
They still put the poor paper-pated space, but this is far away from the city centre.

01:38:30
And then the question could still be whether this poverty is clustered with the you have in the east of the city

01:38:38
or this is roots which are adjacant to each other and is over deep, concentrated.

01:38:48
Or rather this poverty is also decentralized, but also not clustered and not translated.

01:38:57
So you could imagine you could imagine you need to start playing poverty decentralized.

01:39:02
You also expected to be some of the close to the majority.

01:39:05
They are not.

01:39:06
They are not.

01:39:11
Well, for groups of people, in a sense of data,

01:39:16
they should not understand that today or what,

01:39:19
and I should not present something.

01:39:24
Some are in the center of the arms of the thing.

01:39:33
And you would say, "On routine is centralized in the people, our centralized in Brussels,

01:39:53
rich people are not, because they want to be able to do it. And they can't do it. And they can't do it. And they can't do it. No. No. Okay. These are what's known. And this can create a safe, safe, easy, easy. This is for John's family. Take care of that.

01:39:58
[INAUDIBLE]

01:40:00
Well, then it will still be relevant to say that.

01:40:01
It's not a danger.

01:40:08
OK, so five dimensions of segregation,

01:40:12
which also allow you to speak with a little bit more detail

01:40:16
about the social differentiation that you find.

01:40:19
So some only about evenness, people living

01:40:22
in different neighborhoods of the system.

01:40:25
You can also discuss concentration plus three central

01:40:26
activation exposure.

01:40:29
There's another question.

01:40:30
Yeah.

01:40:33
I'm just wondering what the concentration,

01:40:36
does it matter like the portion,

01:40:38
like the size of the population?

01:40:42
Like I demanded a city that they're just not very nice.

01:40:44
Very few people are bored of their,

01:40:45
and then you should have a couple of neighbors

01:40:47
that are in the first book,

01:40:50
and that would be all concentrated,

01:40:53
and how we can help the management experience.

01:40:55
How are many people?

01:40:59
Yeah, I must admit that I don't know exactly how this

01:41:01
would be measured and how it would operate

01:41:03
in a certain measure.

01:41:09
But here, it will be about the size of the group,

01:41:11
how many Chinese do they have?

01:41:14
It will be about the densities that you are talking about.

01:41:18
Tower, it will also be a dangerous square meters

01:41:22
but it implements neighborhoods.

01:41:25
But I don't know how you're with exactly operationalized

01:41:29
that's in this kind of way.

01:41:31
But for me, the important thing is

01:41:33
that you understand that there are different front

01:41:36
pages that you can understand this spatial

01:41:41
differentiation between racial or between like the bias

01:41:46
or between male and female or between normal sexual sexual.

01:41:49
You can look at it in many different ways,

01:41:52
but that you will be able to study it through this final language.

01:41:58
For me, that's important.

01:42:00
And I will ask you how to measure

01:42:03
that's around to operationalize it.

01:42:09
But I hope that you understand that it can be meaningful to do it.

01:42:14
And that is, for example, a figure from your statistical

01:42:32
for culture, for example, you have different kinds of cities, topological and German cities. And it matters whether the rich, for example, still meet a different indigenous cities where rich, do not need to come to meet, do not need to be to.

01:42:39
For example, in the Brussels case, these poor neighborhoods are so close to it.

01:42:45
Okay, just do these neighborhoods where each people work, for example.

01:42:51
You would get all conflicts around the front place, but in other kinds of cities,

01:42:53
that would necessarily beat a case.

01:42:59
So for that reason, these kinds of dimensions do matter.

01:43:05
And I could ask you to apply that to a particular city.

01:43:11
70 minutes left to discuss the goals of segregation.

01:43:18
So why is it that different population groups take a different part of the city?

01:43:24
I guess that all of you have some kind of ideas about it.

01:43:30
What will it be about what kind of explanations would you advise it that rich and poor

01:43:39
and the whites, Hispanic, Asian, people of the origin, people of the cross, that they lived

01:43:42
in a different part of the city.

01:43:43
Why is that?

01:43:53
>> Tell me when it comes to creation or in coming city, they will often choose the name

01:43:58
of the book, for example, like the world age of tea, coming to come to sign for,

01:44:27
[ Inaudible ]

01:44:29
You have another explanation?

01:44:37
I'm in the early early days, different in the health and strength, and then the health and strength.

01:44:43
Through example, teachers are concerned. A public thing in the present world, one in an area.

01:44:53
Okay, so it could be about what you're able to afford and the financial limits that you have to be about, choice to live amongst people like you.

01:45:03
[inaudible]

01:45:13
[ Inaudible ]

01:45:14
>> Okay.

01:45:14
>> Okay.

01:45:14
>> Okay.

01:45:14
>> Okay.

01:45:15
>> Okay.

01:45:16
>> Yeah.

01:45:17
>> Yeah.

01:45:24
>> There are many explanations.

01:45:25
>> Yeah.

01:45:30
>> And it is important for me, but I'm going to try to do

01:45:35
in a very short period of time is to run through a couple of typical explanations.

01:45:39
But I find important is that I'm showing you this crop.

01:45:45
I think you've seen it already in some of the previous classes by the University of

01:45:46
of Austin.

01:45:53
And so what is important for me is that different drug workers or urban thinkers or people

01:46:05
over a human domain of students that have been coming up with different explanations, that also it matters very much from which sub-discipline that they are looking at.

01:46:18
And so family and instructors have been pointing at different explanations of segregation than Marxist-chair-person.

01:46:23
And so for that reason, it is important to situate

01:46:28
this theory to explain segregation on this match.

01:46:30
And my take on it is that one explanation is not

01:46:32
better than the other.

01:46:34
But in order to understand what is happening,

01:46:37
we need to look at financial limits of people.

01:46:40
And Marxists will have a big theory about it.

01:46:43
And but also a choice.

01:46:45
And it will be mostly these.

01:46:49
there are the even older history childrens

01:46:53
who are eager to explore the preferences of people

01:46:57
and why people want to live in a particular neighborhood.

01:47:00
And they will also then go to interview and say,

01:47:03
why is it that you move subverts?

01:47:08
So my point is, I think it's important that you unravel

01:47:11
these different theories made up by these different thinkers

01:47:13
from different disciplines.

01:47:19
quantitative geographers in the 60s

01:47:22
were not so interested in explanations or segregation,

01:47:25
but they had a rich set of mapping tools

01:47:29
to understand these spatial patterns,

01:47:33
but they were not so interested in explanations.

01:47:38
Ecological models, Bergus, she would go and read Bergus,

01:47:43
1925 concentric solo, why do these different population groups

01:47:45
and look at different parts of the city.

01:47:49
Almost like you would have this pioneer fit of fit.

01:47:52
So imagine the beauty area of land.

01:47:54
First you would find grass,

01:47:56
and then you would find shrubs,

01:47:59
and as the shrubs grow, the grass cannot survive anymore

01:48:04
because there's no fighting for the grass.

01:48:05
And then you would get these big trees,

01:48:08
and these shrubs can also not survive.

01:48:12
So you would have competition amongst different types

01:48:14
of which they should put their competition

01:48:16
amongst different populations.

01:48:20
You would have innovation to most desire parts.

01:48:23
So we talk about ecological models.

01:48:27
Because when you read these 100-year-old theories,

01:48:33
that often you find these analogies with ecological models

01:48:39
at your vegetation or the survival of the fittest

01:48:41
almost.

01:48:46
So ecological models they draw on theories of expansion, competition,

01:48:49
in patients, your session of different countries,

01:48:55
in analogy to what you find in among plants.

01:48:59
For Marxist-Jokers, different neighborhoods,

01:49:06
different built environments, our parts of circuits of capital.

01:49:09
And so to understand why different neighborhoods

01:49:11
are produced for different people.

01:49:15
We need to understand the flows of capital,

01:49:17
the entirety of its state,

01:49:22
and look at the circuits in which this built environment

01:49:24
features.

01:49:30
For instance, I'm not going to discuss this whole figure.

01:49:34
But for example, to understand super-binization,

01:49:43
We also need to understand the archivalization regime in which this super-venisation came

01:49:44
across.

01:49:50
And how for example, after the second world war in Belgium, super-venisation was promoted

01:49:56
by the state also because it was a start of a consumption spiral when you suburbanize,

01:49:58
you meet a car.

01:50:01
And so people will buy more cars.

01:50:05
You will need a fridge because this local shop is far away. You will need a freezer

01:50:11
Yeah, so there's a whole consumption spiral that starts when people so urban

01:50:13
So in order to understand why

01:50:19
Superventization of the millic losses was promoted in Belgium, March 36, of course

01:50:24
We need to understand that a group of patients received enriched this function sport

01:50:30
to understand why neighborhoods are being gentrified

01:50:32
and to understand the rent.

01:50:35
Which many of you have lost us by material thinking

01:50:36
and as well that you will explain

01:50:38
how this rent gets worse.

01:50:44
So he tries to understand when you look at gentrification

01:50:49
to a rent gets, say, well, effectively have an invasion

01:50:53
of gentrifying us to borrow this word from burgers

01:50:57
to understand that you need to understand the red gap

01:51:00
and the fact that profit can be made in this neighborhood.

01:51:03
So this is part of capital accumulation.

01:51:08
And so radical marks as drug workers will focus on the fact

01:51:11
that you have the rich in the suburbs or the jail,

01:51:13
and the rich in this gentrifying neighborhood

01:51:17
stable type understand how that fits within this process

01:51:19
of capital accumulation.

01:51:22
Their explanation of segregation will therefore

01:51:29
be rooted in the circuits of capital that Harvey is trying.

01:51:37
In the text by Michael Benvener, the review and the read about the neo-reb

01:51:37
reb

01:51:44
area, there are more constraints to people than only these financial constraints. It's also

01:51:49
about discrimination and it's about the social capital that you have. Are you here about

01:51:55
different resources that might be important in finding a place to it. And I also

01:52:02
the constraints that link to that. And I want to have there at the bottom is

01:52:10
discrimination by people in the real estate systems for different population groups in

01:52:15
in Belgium. You see that there are some significant

01:52:22
and so it's not only about the financial resources that you have.

01:52:25
It's also about your last name, whether that's sexual

01:52:28
French or whether that is an aramic name that will

01:52:32
impact often how easy it is for you to find an apartment or

01:52:37
a place to buy in Belgium.

01:52:46
behavioral drug efforts that are interested in the preference and the perceptions and the decision-making of

01:52:49
visual. So for them to explain

01:52:54
suburbanizations and affect these middle-class families move to the suburbs.

01:52:57
They will think about

01:53:02
push and both things. Why do these people prefer to leave the city? It is

01:53:07
or humans, this overcrowded is the animal,

01:53:09
grime, and so on.

01:53:13
Why are people attracted to the surface well

01:53:15
that are different pieces for them?

01:53:19
But in order to understand segregation,

01:53:22
you also need to understand the preferences

01:53:24
of these different populations.

01:53:27
It's not only about restraints,

01:53:30
it's not only about capital accumulation,

01:53:33
It's also about different groups of people

01:53:36
preferring to live in different kinds of environments.

01:53:39
Students will also be segregated from non-students

01:53:42
because we have a certain, many of you will have

01:53:45
a similar set of preferences that make you not live in

01:53:47
the suburbs, I guess, but that will make you

01:53:51
the closer to the university, closer to places

01:53:53
where interesting things are happening.

01:53:59
And then you also read in this text by

01:54:01
a long time can be done.

01:54:03
And there's a regular one you will also read about

01:54:04
at the cultural.

01:54:06
You can also look at these preferences

01:54:08
through an ethnic lens.

01:54:13
And for example, to explain why people

01:54:18
are broken, Turkish origin in the city of Antwerp

01:54:20
by they live in particular neighborhoods.

01:54:24
You will need to understand their financial restraints.

01:54:27
And they have them to be rather poor.

01:54:32
And so they are forced to live in cheap parts of the city

01:54:34
or cheaper parts of the city.

01:54:36
But you also need to understand their preferences.

01:54:39
And you can also look at that through an ethnic lens.

01:54:40
And many of these more weapons will be

01:54:43
either too close to a mosque or too really close

01:54:47
to the Turkish paper or close to a halal butcher.

01:54:49
And that makes that kind of a big box.

01:54:53
So you can also look through these preferences.

01:54:56
So if you look at these preferences through

01:54:59
and ethnic lips, you could use the same lens

01:55:03
to understand why more and more these more

01:55:05
African families or people for families

01:55:08
or for origin also move to the surface.

01:55:13
That will also be a reference really to a visit.

01:55:17
For example, government bail along

01:55:21
who studied this in the enter of context found out

01:55:27
already quite some time ago, that in these ethnic neighborhoods, as there are also people,

01:55:32
they also have very tight methods of social control, so to move out of these neighborhoods

01:55:38
is also to output this, to move away from the social control in these areas. So you

01:55:46
could have another preference that is linked to this reference. So the ethnic cultural

01:55:52
approach where you look at these preferences through an ethnic lens and obviously it can also be

01:56:01
a criticism. So if Mother and Joker first they will try to understand how housing is important in

01:56:09
identity, kind of raising the truth, conceptualize yourself and the meaning that housing or living

01:56:14
in a particular apartment since he is tasting them. So you see here a whole new title, they

01:56:17
They clap under meaning of house.

01:56:21
And how is it more than just a roof above your head?

01:56:25
It's also about home and feeling at home.

01:56:27
And so these post-post-mother-joker

01:56:31
they try to understand segregation from this lens.

01:56:35
And so they try to understand what moving to the suburbs

01:56:40
means for these milli-class people who did that in the 60s.

01:56:42
That was a thing to do if you had the money,

01:56:44
you're reading the quote, well,

01:56:46
and then you move to the servers.

01:56:49
And so this idea of social mobility

01:56:54
and showing off somehow was quite important

01:56:56
in understanding why this group of people

01:56:59
moved to the servers.

01:57:01
And we can do the same for,

01:57:08
for why these gender fires move back

01:57:10
this often set them to the cities.

01:57:14
It'll also be about a certain identity.

01:57:34
and spend a lot of time to keep the output to see here.

01:57:38
This is also something that is very much promoted by the citizens.

01:57:45
And for example, skier to get these gender fibers and little phosphon, these white, little phosphon,

01:57:55
the tuxion, on these pictures to get them to live in the city because it helps them to have a text space.

01:58:01
So if you want to have money to spend in the city, you will need in the building system,

01:58:05
you will need people currently not from the part of their ecosystem.

01:58:12
And in the city, the city council can do this.

01:58:19
So I'm not really making myself very clear, but the bottom line is that the social and

01:58:24
of the majority of the sites understand why people end up in different parts of the city

01:58:31
through the lens of identity and how we identify as people with the place where we live,

01:58:37
what that means for ourself and others looking in other parts of the city.

01:58:46
I've been really into these slides, yet again the bottom line for me is that to understand why

01:58:50
people live in different neighborhoods that we might need all these

01:58:54
feelings and then it will be about the Marxist idea of capital

01:58:56
implementation. It will be allowed to nail

01:59:01
very many resources and constraints that we have looked at. It will be

01:59:03
about the preferences of people that assume this

01:59:07
picture of the first very interesting will be about

01:59:10
identity formation and what is for mother's

01:59:14
geography of first-born interests. So I could give you another

01:59:20
exam questions. Look at this map there, this confusion of people of Turkish and Moroccan origin

01:59:27
in Antwerp. How were these different photographers explained it? And many of the explanations that

01:59:33
you've given in the beginning of the... So when I started the form of the also of segregation,

01:59:40
having studied five different drug workers learning some disciplines for people in different

01:59:44
parts of what is simply cultural mistakes.

01:59:48
Of course, why do we do that?

01:59:53
Is because we assume that this matters and that segregation has effects and has

01:59:55
cultural interests.

02:00:03
That many people have been eager to understand what was the key for a poor person to this

02:00:05
and neighborhood that is part by whole.

02:00:10
And most people who are people who are living around it doesn't matter whether you

02:00:11
And that kind of neighborhood, the way that you

02:00:14
as a person is in a more mixed neighborhood.

02:00:18
And you have middle class, which is the same.

02:00:19
And we're doing it.

02:00:21
And we're doing it for a city.

02:00:23
And when you have this segregation

02:00:26
of legs living in a particular part of the city

02:00:29
and have a wide-staking of different kinds,

02:00:32
or would it be better to strive for this kind of more

02:00:35
even distribution of legs and a wide-stin

02:00:44
the particular city, or region tour, or young people and old people, whatever social imagery

02:00:47
we used to do.

02:00:53
So next week, I will not discuss patterned those segregation, causes those segregation, but

02:00:56
I will discuss these effects of segregation.

02:01:03
And also, policies of social mixing that are related to them, you get to the heart of

02:01:06
why doesn't matter to study this?

02:01:11
Well, is we just reassume that segregation, concentration,

02:01:15
centralization that is a whole ethics for the people

02:01:19
that we have been talking to them for these two hours?

02:01:25
So in two weeks time, another class on the ethics of segregation.

02:01:28
Next week, Tuesday, feels like to end work,

02:01:33
There are various guests on the field, many of these issues as well.

02:01:42
So I would forward to see many of you in a tour of the Tuesday 8th something in the real

02:01:44
So see you soon.

02:01:46
soon.

02:01:48

# 5 Neighbourhood effects and living with diversity

00:00:12
I have done my best now to restart the stream.

00:00:15
Maybe you can ask whether it is working.

00:00:17
It is difficult for me to check.

00:00:20
I thought I had been doing what I have been doing last week.

00:00:22
It seemed to work then.

00:00:28
But I am also for those who use the streams to study.

00:00:31
I think it makes more sense to use last year's stream,

00:00:33
also for today's lecture,

00:00:35
for those who are following now,

00:00:38
because I prefer to teach for the ones here,

00:00:42
meaning that I will be from my screen.

00:00:43
She'll also put that on again.

00:00:50
Or in the classroom, and that will not be recorded.

00:00:53
And last year, I've just been streaming from my office

00:00:57
because we were not supposed to have lectures anymore.

00:01:03
So I feel that it's better to draw in lost the SZ and also for the ones who come and be

00:01:13
here today. But also in case you want to study the slides are 99% safe. So I think it makes

00:01:17
most sense to use lost years of live streets also for last weeks.

00:01:27
Do you have any information about this tree now?

00:01:30
I think it's working.

00:01:38
Okay, I'll do my best to move it in that direction.

00:01:42
Okay, so let's suppose that the tree is working.

00:01:47
If not, everyone can rely on last year's theme.

00:01:52
Okay, I think quite many of you are here.

00:01:55
I don't know how many students I'm expected to have.

00:01:57
I think 70 or 80% is here.

00:02:02
Good, the ideal of social mix.

00:02:05
And so I thought you already,

00:02:09
I told you already that in many cities across the world,

00:02:11
there has been a concern with segregation.

00:02:13
And then we're supposed,

00:02:19
that segregation has negative effects on poor people.

00:02:22
So, add that you're worse off when you're poor,

00:02:25
when you're living in a neighborhood where

00:02:30
with a concentration of poverty, rather than in a mixed neighborhood,

00:02:35
where you have both working class people and a good class.

00:02:40
Already in the 19th century,

00:02:46
the heydays of the industrial revolution. You have very different groups

00:02:54
the capitalistic bourgeoisie and the Ethiopian socialists and so both the bourgeoisie

00:03:03
and the socialists who are afraid or who are thinking that concentrations of laborers

00:03:09
in particular neighborhoods of the city, for example here in Brussels in Bolognese at that time,

00:03:15
and for it and to work in an unfair report and put it out,

00:03:18
that this would have negative effects.

00:03:23
And the bourgeoisie was afraid that concentrations

00:03:25
of laborers might lead to revolutions,

00:03:29
that socialist thinking would become dominant

00:03:32
in these neighborhoods, and that you would never

00:03:34
recall that people would get upstream.

00:03:39
And the utopian socialists, they were scared

00:03:46
that these concentrations of lasers would make it more

00:03:50
difficult to strive for an egalitarian society.

00:03:53
And so on both ends of the political spectrum,

00:03:56
you had people who were thinking that it

00:03:58
places such as Manchester or Gental Brussels,

00:04:02
where you had these new working laws, neighborhoods,

00:04:08
that this was something that to be contracted.

00:04:10
This ideal is still very dominant nowadays.

00:04:14
Here you see a quote from

00:04:19
the Russell Scapfoe region,

00:04:21
by the old one working,

00:04:23
current policy of the country,

00:04:24
which I'm similar quotes,

00:04:28
stating that contrary to the American city,

00:04:31
the ideal type for the European city

00:04:33
is based on the mix of functions and,

00:04:37
and I think it's important to make a distinction

00:04:43
between these two things on the one hand they refer to a functional mix, meaning that

00:04:49
they would like to strive for neighborhoods where you have a mix of the residential function

00:04:52
of artisans and houses.

00:05:01
And for example, offices or shops, saying that well, it's not good to have neighborhoods

00:05:05
they only have a residential fridge.

00:05:09
And other neighborhoods where your only have offices.

00:05:13
And so we strive for a Brussels with neighborhoods

00:05:16
where you have a functional mix.

00:05:19
And the other thing, this is what we are interested in.

00:05:24
A is saying, well, we also want Brussels

00:05:28
by other European citizens who have neighborhoods

00:05:31
with a mix of people, poor people and rich people.

00:05:35
And in Brussels, there have been many different moments

00:05:40
where this topic of social mixed

00:05:42
has been on the political agenda.

00:05:44
I think there is a few,

00:05:50
but not surprised to Brussels only a month ago.

00:05:52
I might have heard of these discussions around

00:05:55
paper, was social housing estate,

00:05:57
Unmanlyed.

00:06:01
Sorry, the periphery of the Brussels capital region.

00:06:06
And therefore, you have quite some media reports about crime.

00:06:09
And then the issue of, well, you have all these

00:06:15
to be accommodated on the social housing estate

00:06:17
in Brussels and in Belgium,

00:06:21
more generally you need to fall below certain income

00:06:30
And meaning that it's mainly the poorest of the poor that do concentrate on the social housing

00:06:31
instance.

00:06:36
And so then you have discussions, well, is that the good thing?

00:06:44
Is this not leading to this culture where crime or con- and conservative politicians would

00:06:47
erase these kinds of those sorts?

00:06:52
Progressive politicians would wonder, well, is that then a neighborhood where they're

00:07:00
it is easy for people to climb the social building. Wouldn't it be easier to be socially mobile

00:07:06
when you are not only surrounded by other poor people, but when you are living between

00:07:15
and poor and rich people are like it. So beta-bles, a neighborhood in on the left,

00:07:24
And obviously also in the way of these terrorist attacks in 2015, there were a lot of concerns

00:07:31
also in the international youth, about knowledge and their reports about knowledge,

00:07:37
as they were doing as a get-up. I've been looking at the statistics. I think

00:07:44
of all the makers of the most people of Moroccan origin,

00:07:50
the most followers of Islam, but it's still less than half.

00:07:54
So in the international media, it was often

00:07:59
reported as if Mollum May was immunistic, but with only

00:08:06
Moroccan people and people of Moroccan origins.

00:08:09
And then you look at this example, it's not the case.

00:08:13
Nonetheless, there were some concerns,

00:08:16
hopefully, that also could be a penalty.

00:08:20
About Mollumbe being a safe haven,

00:08:24
for there is a breeding ground for their central tech

00:08:28
that you have this concentration of people

00:08:36
of the same origin was then the reason to be, to be concerned.

00:08:40
So both when it comes to social mobility

00:08:46
and when it comes to cultural integration, new commerce,

00:08:50
there are concerns, ethnicity, such as Brussels,

00:08:53
about the concentration of either two people

00:08:56
or people of foreign origin.

00:08:59
These are two different issues, social mobility

00:09:03
and social control in the future.

00:09:05
As I said, was there a question?

00:09:11
So, the structure of five people?

00:09:16
No, I am trying to explain you.

00:09:19
I'm not saying that there is a desire to plan

00:09:21
or supply in the social mix,

00:09:23
but I'm trying to explain you that in many cities

00:09:27
across the world, I will start from a couple of intelligent examples.

00:09:31
This idea of social mix is high on the whole of the knowledge.

00:09:35
memory, very to this data, most issue, and more on the

00:09:39
app to the errors, the text as to moments, where social mix

00:09:43
was highly debated. Local media in case of this

00:09:47
terrorist, the text also is informational.

00:09:51
Um, Brussels, we move to Gint,

00:09:54
an informer colleague of mine,

00:09:57
that's written a nice book about gentrification

00:10:01
in the nation, in this name is a spot called Tukkau,

00:10:04
so for those who know the church and for our interests

00:10:09
that they find some interest in the literature.

00:10:13
And see a quote from an elder man of the city of Kent

00:10:17
talking about a production of Kent neighborhoods

00:10:19
such as wish support,

00:10:23
neighborhoods that have a similar history

00:10:30
a small make in Brussels or in Al-Terepa North in Antwerp.

00:10:34
Neighborhoods that have developed in this 19th century

00:10:37
industrial industrialization.

00:10:44
And so neighborhoods with a higher than average

00:10:49
percentage of unemployment, higher than average percentage

00:10:53
of people, also a higher than average percentage

00:10:55
of people or for an average, etc.

00:10:57
What was this elder man saying?

00:11:01
Well, when I attract young families,

00:11:06
preferably with a job, preferably double income families

00:11:11
that will improve my social tissue, my sex base,

00:11:15
and my neighborhood life.

00:11:16
I think these are different health

00:11:21
serves the dead space, something important, I'm sorry.

00:11:27
In Belgium, about 40 to 50% of the municipal budget

00:11:29
comes from local taxes.

00:11:33
Most of it is a percentage on the local income tax

00:11:37
and percentage on the income tax,

00:11:40
meaning that if you have more rich people

00:11:43
in your municipality, that you will have

00:11:45
a higher municipal budget.

00:11:50
Yeah. The other part comes from Lent and I'll study you.

00:11:54
So why did this other amount of Ghent finally

00:11:58
for the trends? Young families prefer to leave a joke.

00:12:01
They look lost from the white families.

00:12:04
They still improve these local text things.

00:12:09
So you have more budgets for the city of Ghent.

00:12:10
But on top of that,

00:12:19
It's also important to improve my social tissue, and I will go further intuitive, but often

00:12:26
there the underlying thought is that, for example, when you have rich and poor people,

00:12:32
when you have families, really good job and families without the job that you will get

00:12:38
diverse social networks, for example, and that in these networks, jobs can be found for

00:12:41
people can be held with homework, etc.

00:12:48
So this ID for the importance to attract young families,

00:12:50
we call it refurbishment.

00:12:55
It's not only for to improve text-based obesity,

00:12:58
but also to improve the social tissue and the labor

00:13:01
of life.

00:13:07
In very much a similar way, we move to the city of Annenberg,

00:13:10
And we have been visiting this unperturbed port,

00:13:12
the neighborhood, the neighborhood,

00:13:16
where I think 25% of the new covers in Enter

00:13:20
passed through before moving to other parts of the city

00:13:23
and neighborhood that is quite similar to this transition.

00:13:28
So the burgers was describing in my own sanctuary style.

00:13:32
And I've been talking there about a lot of regulations

00:13:36
that affected shopkeepers in the neighborhood,

00:13:43
but also regulations that concern the subdivision of houses.

00:13:49
And you see there that in the previous government agreement in

00:13:55
Enter, it was stated that the city wants a larger share of single-family

00:14:02
developments in this particular neighborhood in the housing supply in order to attract families.

00:14:06
I always find it interesting to see this kind of word.

00:14:10
Often the youngster means young people of foreign backgrounds.

00:14:13
What you see here is that families excuse me,

00:14:17
what is land is funnel-in-mail families,

00:14:19
all of them are white countries.

00:14:23
So that is why the transformation of single-family

00:14:27
develops into smaller housing entities is not desired.

00:14:29
And for those who joined the mentor,

00:14:34
We have been discussing how could you support the arrival function in this neighborhood?

00:14:40
Well, then people are looking for a very cheap place to live and they will rent a room

00:14:42
for even just a mattress.

00:14:47
And that's what they would for the cheapest roof above their heads.

00:14:52
What you see here is that the city of Hanford is not so poor, the arrival of the church.

00:15:01
defines it in importance to bring another kind of people to this neighborhood, namely richer

00:15:12
levels. So again, you see efforts here to turn this out to an open north into the social

00:15:22
the mixed neighborhood where you have newcomers next to white families who can afford to buy

00:15:32
such a big house just for the use of one family. In the art in the art, people by

00:15:37
I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

00:15:42
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

00:15:47
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

00:15:51
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

00:15:55
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

00:15:59
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

00:16:06
of foreign origin, you had demolition projects and you had the creation of new dwellings

00:16:14
that try to cater for different audiences. And again, you see the, this is a course

00:16:22
from the Army Department of State, you see that the idea was that in these neighborhoods

00:16:29
that can be transformed, that these big inhabitants,

00:16:31
the people who used to live there,

00:16:34
were seriously disadvantaged by a rare name.

00:16:38
And the idea was that living in such a neighborhood

00:16:41
being poor in such a neighborhood,

00:16:46
accessor-based poverty makes it worse,

00:16:48
not basically living in such a neighborhood

00:16:51
is worse than living in another name.

00:16:58
that is only more difficult to find out a poverty in such a neighborhood of the parts of this.

00:17:07
So for this reason, it was a big, big and project to basically the knowledge match of the house

00:17:13
in these neighborhoods and to build new houses that cater for different audiences.

00:17:22
Slater also refers to this whole sixth program in the UK and the US sorry.

00:17:31
For example, Capri Nichri, a neighborhood of miles to the north of Peru in Chicago.

00:17:34
Lastly, there have been quite a bit of a Chicago.

00:17:42
A neighborhood with a very bad reputation for drug use and any crime and any other things.

00:17:51
And again what has been done there is that many of these apartment blocks that have been torn down have been demolished.

00:17:58
And that you houses have been built again trying to cater for other kind of hope.

00:18:05
It's trying to bring the millic loss to a neighborhood that was previously painted in evident fire.

00:18:12
And then in the situation of the SU-minded hurdle, this far geosystem,

00:18:17
where many of the original residents of the neighborhood such as that,

00:18:24
other voucher, and basically to give them discount on their rent price,

00:18:29
in other parts of the city trying to encourage them to move and to better off

00:18:33
neighborhoods in other parts of the ocean garden.

00:18:44
So again you see attempts to mix neighborhoods in the conviction that the concentration of poverty

00:18:51
is bad that it leads to crime and it leads to drug use and that it is bad for these

00:18:53
inhabitants.

00:19:01
South Africa? Yeah? I want to know what's going on, how come about it?

00:19:09
It's the... Well, I think the outcome, there are many, many papers about this and many scholars

00:19:17
looking at different sides of this medal, but I think in the article by Stom Slater, page

00:19:26
369 I see here. It is stated that no effects have been reported for a number of outcomes

00:19:34
and that at first effects on the delinquency and physical health of

00:19:42
Adorsant males in particular have been reported but positive effects on adult mental health and

00:19:48
education and health of young women. So it depends very much what you're looking at, but in any

00:19:54
case studies who try it and to find out like what happened to the people who moved to middle

00:20:02
class neighborhoods, found very at first effects and in any case one good question whether such

00:20:15
Well, because the project was the best one to try and improve the situation of computer and Chicago.

00:20:22
I will discuss the effects of such programs in more detail. But before doing that, I wanted to

00:20:28
highlight that in many countries across the world, US, UK, many built-insities,

00:20:33
and basically all over the Europe in South Africa.

00:20:35
And then step in,

00:20:37
to create socially mixed neighborhoods

00:20:40
in the conviction that segregation

00:20:43
and the concentration of poverty is bad

00:20:46
for people living in just the situation.

00:20:52
One question, okay, yeah.

00:20:55
Why is there this idea that I can't speak?

00:20:58
Like, you know, there's a target.

00:21:07
[ Inaudible ]

00:21:08
>> I don't know what to say.

00:21:09
I don't know how to make the definition of inclusion.

00:21:18
In any case, I think it's another coincidence that all of these projects that you see here

00:21:26
are about bringing the middle class to neighborhoods which used to be predominant for

00:21:28
And the future.

00:21:31
This fire-shark program that I was just talking about

00:21:33
is also doing the other way,

00:21:34
doing it the other way around because it's

00:21:40
nice to bring four people to a milliposs neighbor.

00:21:44
And so this is also a project where milli-class neighborhoods

00:21:47
are also becoming more or mixed.

00:21:49
Because by giving these rents subsidies

00:21:55
through this fire-shark system, it allows people

00:21:58
and the religious people to move to a better off parts

00:21:59
of the city as well.

00:22:02
But I will come back to that.

00:22:04
For now,

00:22:10
we, it's good that you already start to wondering

00:22:12
about effects of these programs.

00:22:15
But as I said for now, it's important that you see

00:22:19
that in many parts, in many corners of the world,

00:22:24
this ideal of socially mixed,

00:22:31
socially mixed neighborhoods seems to be a very stable kind of idea.

00:22:38
And it's very predominant among policy makers, both on the left and on the right.

00:22:45
So on both ends of the political spectrum, you find this pretty four neighborhoods

00:22:53
that house people with different origins or people of different social economic backgrounds.

00:23:06
Two questions we need to ask about this is it possible then to create social index mixed neighborhoods and then a third visit or second the second question.

00:23:11
Is it desirable to do it?

00:23:17
And the article by a little stator gives, or those stators

00:23:21
gives an historical, apparently clear answer referring

00:23:27
to this whole six program in the United States

00:23:30
and housing markets review rule in the UK

00:23:32
is stating that whatever they don't,

00:23:35
they have basically just shifted over the elsewhere.

00:23:38
This has not been a remedy to overty.

00:23:42
This has just made full people elsewhere in the city.

00:23:47
The mode of production that shapes urban environment,

00:23:49
extreme net,

00:23:52
it's referring to the capitalistic system

00:23:57
there, the system of production of capitalism,

00:24:01
produce concentrations of poverty

00:24:05
that many policymakers, as we have seen,

00:24:07
rejoice in bringing up.

00:24:11
yet, at same mode of production,

00:24:15
churning in tech produces further concentrations

00:24:17
just down the street.

00:24:22
I still remember one of my former professors

00:24:24
saying that, well, many of these attempts

00:24:27
to create socially mixed neighborhoods

00:24:31
by attracting middle class people

00:24:35
to, for example, who neighbors?

00:24:39
in Brussels has just shifted this over the elsewhere. And for that reason, the

00:24:49
he made this comparison with moving chairs on the deck of the Titanic. People remain poor,

00:24:56
which you just make them move somewhere else. But this does not improve their socio-economic

00:25:02
position. This does not help them to climb the social ladder. In the day's fight, I can't

00:25:06
all you have also seen is reference to water bed.

00:25:16
So when you look at that, it seems to be very hard to create a social mix.

00:25:19
The same goes for Brussels.

00:25:23
I have been referring to this article by Martin,

00:25:27
like Knee King, already in Shadow 1.

00:25:35
And basically what material has been doing is to study people moving out of

00:25:41
gender-ifying neighborhoods in Brussels. What happens to people who move out of

00:25:48
neighborhoods in Brussels that are gender-ifying? And basically he made a distinction

00:25:54
between different clusters of people and if I'm correct, then cluster one

00:25:58
consistent mainly of highly educated German coefficients.

00:26:03
Where do they move as neighborhoods in versus gentry5?

00:26:10
They move to and to work and gensh and also some of the municipalities of Plava,

00:26:11
one of them.

00:26:13
And these are municipalities.

00:26:17
These people find a joke in another city, in another part of Belgium.

00:26:23
They move out of these gentry5 neighborhoods and they move to a place closer to the place

00:26:25
and that's where it is.

00:26:31
But the tool consisted of more working-wise people,

00:26:35
people with a lower-than-average income,

00:26:39
where you then move first of all to,

00:26:45
well, make difficulties along the canal,

00:26:49
and such as Holland and U of Warden,

00:26:52
the home of our familiar all of you are

00:26:54
to the geography of Belgium already,

00:26:57
but these are also usability small towns

00:27:00
that have gone through a process of industrialization

00:27:02
and where humans find small houses

00:27:06
that will be cheaper than the houses you would find

00:27:09
in these gentry-fly neighborhoods in Brussels.

00:27:12
And so what you see here is that gentry-ification

00:27:15
comes with displacement, for example,

00:27:18
to a municipality such as Phil Moore.

00:27:26
So as you see these clusters you can find rather far from Brussels,

00:27:36
Cenvois, Laudien, Mols, many town cities in this 19th century

00:27:41
built for industrialization in the Indian culture.

00:27:46
So these are municipalities very much find housing for a rather

00:27:53
cheap price. So if you follow material by thinking this argument, then you would see,

00:28:02
well, what happens here is that by trying to improve the lives of poor people in Brussels,

00:28:11
through creating the social mix, attracting the middle class to these neighborhoods. What you see

00:28:18
is that these people moved, are displaced to other municipalities,

00:28:23
where you also have concentrations of poor people.

00:28:29
But they are located in much worse situations, locations,

00:28:32
where it comes to finding a drug for it.

00:28:38
And so what is happening here is a shifting the chairs on the deck of the Titanic

00:28:42
over these still exists, but by attracting the middle of the loss to some

00:28:49
neighborhoods from Brussels, you move forward the elsewhere. To places where

00:28:54
people can afford to live, and these are neighborhoods that we have been

00:29:01
visiting in Isha, the Walker, and Salk. We're here buying a house or renting an

00:29:05
apartment will be much cheaper than this in San

00:29:10
actually, for some of the other genshifying parts of process.

00:29:16
This map shows something very similar for Antwerp,

00:29:20
those who joined to Antwerp by a recognized

00:29:23
its first reading, the medieval Antwerp,

00:29:28
the second reading, 19th century industrial Antwerp,

00:29:32
and what is not...

00:29:40
visualizes is a synthesis index of this advantage.

00:29:42
And you see that in some neighborhoods,

00:29:46
there are no big changes in the last years

00:29:46
in this index.

00:29:49
They are yellow, for example,

00:29:52
blue fall social housing estates

00:29:55
that we have visited the remains yellow situation.

00:29:57
There does not really change.

00:30:01
You also see other parts of the city, for example,

00:30:06
A luncheon, the area around the museum that we are doing.

00:30:10
You see that this is blue.

00:30:15
And many of the inner city neighborhoods

00:30:18
in Alberta, the North, for example, are also blue.

00:30:24
At the same time, you see that other parts of the city,

00:30:28
for example, medicine and dirt on the outside

00:30:32
of this 19th century, well by a sea of worsening

00:30:34
of this synthesis.

00:30:36
That's also here.

00:30:39
Through this map, you could see that, well,

00:30:41
some neighborhoods are attracting

00:30:43
four million plus people,

00:30:46
but poverty is shifted elsewhere in the city

00:30:50
is moving to other parts of the urban region.

00:30:53
This map is just giving you the situation

00:30:57
for the municipality or the city of Antwerp,

00:30:59
that if you would include the global programs

00:31:03
of the vendor, you might see that, for example,

00:31:06
all for people to know the future.

00:31:11
Or they're high in the people region.

00:31:13
They're yet to be split effectors,

00:31:15
to be protected to the boss,

00:31:18
that you would see a worsening of the issue.

00:31:22
So we can try to attract villain loss people.

00:31:23
That's when the city of the service,

00:31:27
You can try to attract the middle of the law, so it's back to the city.

00:31:35
But this place is people from these neighborhoods who cannot order their

00:31:39
anymore. So this is whose poverty elsewhere?

00:31:40
Yeah.

00:31:41
Question?

00:31:47
[inaudible]

00:31:54
Well, I must admit that I don't go all the imitators in this specific index, but I guess

00:32:02
it will be about average income, unemployment, I may be some other indicators that say

00:32:07
something about this name.

00:32:11
But I should have put this.

00:32:16
So much of what we see here confirms this ID of Slater

00:32:20
when clicking in that well, trying to create a social mix

00:32:22
in some parts of the city.

00:32:28
Will shift poverty will make a poverty move elsewhere.

00:32:32
I will create, that's what Slater said,

00:32:37
will create over concentrations of poverty.

00:32:41
This is just down the street in shallow go up

00:32:46
are the case of these gentry flying neighborhoods of Brussels, in bone for the gentry flying.

00:32:53
So that's where in medicine, in Berlin, in other parts of these urban regions.

00:33:02
There are examples in the world where mixed neighborhoods are being created.

00:33:10
But then it's only possible when city councils or governments can have a serious

00:33:19
impact upon who is living in specific neighborhoods.

00:33:28
In some parts of the world, scholars write about conclusion that we housing or inclusion

00:33:35
every zoning forcing for example real estate developers who devour a high tower

00:33:44
full of apartments to dedicate a certain percentage of these residents

00:33:51
residential units to people who fall below a certain income threshold and so

00:34:01
you can create a social-emixed neighborhood. If you force real estate developers to

00:34:13
well in a newly built project, you have a certain percentage of apartments,

00:34:18
of four people, of the certain, in people, are fully low-surfing in countries.

00:34:26
In Enter, I've been talking about this Catholic's neighborhood. This was the land of the port in

00:34:36
public hands. And so, this is the council could also sell this land to developers with a lot of

00:34:46
conditions. And so, developers could buy this land under the condition that they built 25% of the

00:34:53
There is digital units for social housing, 15% rent, 10% to buy.

00:35:00
And then they reserved 50% of the units at affordable prices.

00:35:06
And that was not very affordable, but at least you could not ask whatever you wanted.

00:35:08
This prices could not skyrocket.

00:35:12
You could not ask whatever you wanted for these residential units.

00:35:19
And so you could argue, a socially mixed neighborhood has been developed here almost from

00:35:21
scratch because only it's white.

00:35:26
The looks that you see here are new and only the brown ones exist.

00:35:32
But that was possible because the land was public owned and could be sold to developers

00:35:38
under the condition that the reserve is kind of.

00:35:47
it's for certain degrees of people. And I make a look who is able to rent or buy these units

00:35:56
without in case you can follow a certain income threshold in order to be able to be eligible

00:36:07
for the social housing. Yes. The same goes for this affordability criteria. I don't know how

00:36:14
what was the price exactly. But I see here that you could earn up to 58 euro of

00:36:21
family, almost 4 euro added for each additional person. So we are buying quite high

00:36:27
incomes already. But the bottom line is that these developers could not just build whatever

00:36:34
they want. That they need to meet certain criteria and that they also need to serve

00:36:41
Why the British number of units for people belong to different income units.

00:36:48
At the lowest income, the degrees, social housing, and then the points of house to work.

00:36:56
So, a socially mixed neighborhood when it comes to income, when it comes to poverty and wealth,

00:37:01
could be created. But that was only possible because there was a serious intervention

00:37:07
of the Sydney Council in this.

00:37:12
In Belgium, the government or public authorities

00:37:16
are not really able to intervene that much in housing.

00:37:21
Because it's only days of blasters, 6% of the units,

00:37:23
which are social housing.

00:37:28
In Brussels are 10% and all the risks,

00:37:31
the development sessions, minor exceptions,

00:37:33
all the rest is the market.

00:37:36
It's either people who are home, house,

00:37:39
or people who rent the house from another market.

00:37:42
But there are cities across the world

00:37:47
where you have 50% social house in that workshop

00:37:50
or under the dump is another small,

00:37:52
a high percentage of social house.

00:37:54
That also means that as a council,

00:37:58
you can be to be quite a bit in who it is where.

00:38:07
in the dodging days where 90% of the people need to find a house or accommodation on the market,

00:38:13
you will see that attempts to create a social mix quickly lead to displacement and quickly

00:38:17
lead to concentrations of poverty elsewhere.

00:38:25
And this is very much the dependent on how this particular house mix looks like and how much

00:38:30
because the councils can interfere in the housing.

00:38:32
(mumbling)

00:38:44
So it's a place?

00:38:48
There has been a time when the social housing association

00:38:53
sold out of the white, some units, that they know it is.

00:38:57
In any case, there's no research.

00:39:04
And these type of files are a project for the developer.

00:39:08
This question will be, I will be in the chat.

00:39:15
As long as they can still make profits, this is possible.

00:39:18
The same goes for this inclusion of housing.

00:39:25
as long as the developer is able to take profits, then this is also.

00:39:33
In this case, I know that the developers have to pay a lot of money to sit and get this piece of debt.

00:39:43
And because they were also asked to cater for these public sectors, they had to develop the parts and the streets.

00:40:01
And they have to say that in the local social house, to the city quit it very much more money by selling this piece of land for the highest price to develop and to build a sparkles for the obvious people who chose to do things different.

00:40:08
And there are many parts of the world where we have this kind of skis.

00:40:10
Yeah.

00:40:18
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:26
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:31
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:32
Okay.

00:40:34
Is social mixed feasible?

00:40:36
The answer is yes.

00:40:41
In this feasible, it is possible to create socially mixed neighborhoods,

00:40:46
but it is very hard to do that in a situation where the market rates,

00:40:51
and because then trying to attract middle-class families

00:40:56
who are poor neighborhoods will lead to displacement of poor families

00:40:58
to other parts of the country.

00:41:01
In this case, that will not happen, because you reserve

00:41:10
25% of the neighborhood to people who fall below a certain interest zone.

00:41:17
And as long as these units are social housing, these 35% will remain there for this

00:41:18
population.

00:41:31
So you allow people to live in a neighborhood where 50% belongs to

00:41:38
a village loss from the upper middle of the class and 25% of these units goes to a

00:41:44
baby, which people can afford to spend one million here or one.

00:41:46
Another question?

00:41:48
Yeah, I have a question.

00:41:51
For instance, it would be like,

00:41:54
social takes early in this one,

00:41:58
for instance, areas, areas of the city.

00:42:01
But then when in this view, I'm asking for an example, actually,

00:42:04
can't wear a capitol of the city.

00:42:06
For example, for keeping, I mean,

00:42:08
just from experience,

00:42:10
to work out, I don't know,

00:42:12
for example, usually if you are,

00:42:19
like very up-to-date luxury, the lane there are so affordable and so powerful.

00:42:27
However, this has been changed if it's given up to a track.

00:42:32
So it might be different people of different things from the system.

00:42:41
But then the general effect was actually that it's upper class and the capitalist developed.

00:42:48
It's not like actually the people who are living there beforehand and maybe I could reserve a

00:42:55
It's a good question. I think in this case

00:43:03
People who lived there were just a fish that were ready that was not so much the case yet because you only had a couple of hundreds of people

00:43:06
You develop a neighborhood for thousands of people

00:43:11
It was a neighborhood that was more true than it was.

00:43:12
That was not so much worse.

00:43:15
Just, I guess it was, of course, like,

00:43:20
when there's a, when there's an example of

00:43:23
gensification, people all around it,

00:43:26
and not really attempting to solve.

00:43:31
They're trying to

00:43:40
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:44
Well, I guess it depends how you will argue the 100th.

00:43:48
Also, you would say that your vacation goes with displacement

00:43:52
and displacement with the essential part of the change of education.

00:43:57
In this case, there might be a displacement

00:44:00
of the people who lived in these brown houses.

00:44:05
And who lived there already before the rest of the neighborhoods,

00:44:07
before the white parts of the neighborhoods,

00:44:09
were being concerned.

00:44:16
But there will not be a place in these 25% units,

00:44:21
which are either rented out or sold as social house.

00:44:24
Because you will need to fall below a certain income

00:44:30
order to buy or rent these goods. And no matter what happens in the rest of the day's

00:44:38
request, the students will still remain like reserves for people following those income

00:44:44
threshold. So this is a way to make sure that these places will not happen. Even if you

00:44:53
buy these kind of, you will not be able to sell them, and if you rent them out, then this is

00:44:55
There's also another condition that's followed below.

00:44:56
So it's just the average.

00:45:03
But it's only applied to the red part here.

00:45:04
Yeah, indeed.

00:45:05
That's the current moment.

00:45:10
Everything else at this whole area has been

00:45:13
identified that has been over-renewaled in this whole area.

00:45:16
So it's only in that very small part,

00:45:18
where they were able to create a solution.

00:45:20
So this is the my area of it though.

00:45:22
Is it really achieving a solution?

00:45:27
Yeah, one important thing is to scale the scale of which we discuss things.

00:45:33
Now we are talking about a very small scale neighborhood of a couple of thousand people.

00:45:36
But indeed, if you discuss it at the scale of Enter,

00:45:45
then you will see that this whole area around this red square that we've just been talking about has been going through

00:45:51
and improvement of this, this advantage in mix and has been going through

00:45:58
at, at very strong gender education. Sorry, that's, they're completely just a

00:46:03
fairly fair film. I don't need violence. I'm sorry. But then I'm just curious

00:46:09
how it works here. Like, um, due to the private health, we can get tax based

00:46:11
or like, and it's from the government or the YH.

00:46:15
It's from the government because I was a member.

00:46:17
Well, I don't know about these these

00:46:20
thanks for your base, but for sure the length price

00:46:23
for which they were able to acquire this.

00:46:27
Well, the price for which they were able to buy this piece

00:46:31
of length from the city council was much lower

00:46:36
than it would have been just a market with a firm.

00:46:38
OK.

00:47:08
Okay, is it yeah more questions? Okay now we move to the next question. This

00:47:10
is it good or bad?

00:47:13
Is it desirable to create such a name?

00:47:16
Now, I'm going to say in the globe,

00:47:19
the kind of shops that you find really good with that.

00:47:24
The most big caters for the needs and the desires

00:47:28
of this 75% of residents and a lot of tourists

00:47:32
and visitors who like to visit the market.

00:47:35
And so that could be a reason to say, well,

00:47:37
it's not desirable to do this.

00:47:41
because these people will not find cheap food in the area

00:47:46
for the kind of problems they would like to buy.

00:47:51
But that shows that we are moving to the next question,

00:47:53
the social mix desire.

00:47:57
I guess it would be time for a break.

00:48:00
I'm running a bit behind some into.

00:48:05
I'm wondering there is a three hours or a decade

00:48:08
to over-joker.

00:48:12
Boston has been limiting by Boston powers.

00:48:15
We've been big for all, we have a goal of its power

00:48:17
just two hours and one for us.

00:48:23
Okay, I'll just go to the slides.

00:48:28
We'll see, we'll see what time, what time,

00:48:30
but I think it's better to have a great job

00:48:32
before moving to this next question.

00:48:39
is a desirable way to start with five minutes and then we continue.

>> So let's continue with this question

00:54:53
by social mixed desire.

00:54:59
[ Inaudible ]

00:55:06
I think I need to skim the question number four or part number four.

00:55:14
But in any case, I'm really excited to go into the arguments here.

00:55:24
And the overarching assumption amongst policy-makers and also in the dominance of high-pumpies

00:55:44
Amongst researchers seems to be that very good lift affects your life chances. Whether you lift an end to work in this line clock, this social housing estate, live power.

00:56:13
or whether you live as a poor person in un

00:56:17
And they make their residence verse 4.

00:56:26
Maybe two observations before I were looking to the different arguments,

00:56:32
the difference and the ways in which this question has been answered.

00:56:39
Observation number one is that researchers working in different subdisciplines

00:56:43
I've been showing you this diagram last week already.

00:56:46
Research is working in different sub disciplines

00:56:51
of human geography, urban studies, or broadly.

00:56:54
Have been answering this question, different?

00:56:58
A rareal two positions, a lot later on the map.

00:57:02
What kind of geographer is he?

00:57:04
Do you have an ID?

00:57:07
Mark says geographer, they're writing about the capitalistic

00:57:09
of protection.

00:57:13
And he's a Marxist chauffeur.

00:57:20
And he's mainly interested in social economic issues.

00:57:22
Yeah?

00:57:26
What happens to poor people when they live in a poor neighborhood?

00:57:28
Other chauffeur first have been asking different police

00:57:31
members, for example, in the ancient New York,

00:57:34
and the cultural segregation.

00:57:35
as a whole article by

00:57:37
my paper and

00:57:40
whose written deals with

00:57:42
ethnic segregation

00:57:43
and not with

00:57:44
social and economic

00:57:46
segregation

00:57:47
amongst his children

00:57:48
children for such as

00:57:49
false later

00:57:51
only interested in

00:57:52
social and economic

00:57:54
segregation

00:57:55
and who are at the reach

00:57:56
people live

00:57:58
and this is that meaning for

00:58:01
in the eradication of poverty for example

00:58:02
so you see that different

00:58:09
have been asking different research questions when it comes to these effects of

00:58:13
segregation. They have also been using different research mental

00:58:21
colleges. We use large surveys. They have a survey of 1 people in order to

00:58:26
answer these questions or do you have called it negative research where you

00:58:29
the Interfuge Thirds Fellows,

00:58:32
and we're 13 people living in a thing,

00:58:35
or this place from a thing.

00:58:36
So different research,

00:58:37
mental politics,

00:58:39
and then you've also been reading

00:58:42
in the article by Adam Slather,

00:58:45
that that might also be different ideology

00:58:46
under things,

00:58:50
underlying the work of these different.

00:58:52
So I think it is important for you

00:58:55
to understand that just like I,

00:58:58
I could last week for the courses of segregation

00:59:02
and the different arguments that have been given

00:59:06
for why people live in segregated neighborhoods.

00:59:10
And also when it comes to these effects of segregation

00:59:13
as a role that's been showed around that

00:59:15
that people are working in different conditions

00:59:19
and different sub-disaboots of human geography

00:59:23
have been giving different answers

00:59:26
to these questions.

00:59:30
Another remark that I want to give before going

00:59:36
to the answer to that question is that it is important

00:59:41
to see that studies on neighborhood effects

00:59:43
bear birthmarks.

00:59:44
What do I need with that?

00:59:49
Is it matters to bear a study of the eclipse?

00:59:51
And then often, for example, the literature

00:59:54
of the effects of segregation.

00:59:58
Conducting studies conducted in the United States,

01:00:02
the conclusions of these studies have been used, for example,

01:00:06
to influence policy in Western Europe.

01:00:11
And a while it is quite important to see the differences

01:00:13
between these different contexts.

01:00:15
Last week, I have been highlighting, for example,

01:00:19
that when it comes to desegregation,

01:00:27
in the United States, the United States is much stronger or prevalent than it is

01:00:28
in Europe.

01:00:34
So there's an important difference when you take the conclusions from one country to

01:00:35
the other.

01:00:42
The welfare states in Western Europe has been much more developed than in the United States.

01:00:47
So when it comes to poverty and the eradication of poverty, this is a completely different

01:00:49
issue in a Western European context.

01:00:53
And this is an American.

01:00:59
So it's important that you contextualize studies

01:01:03
on segregation in the United States, for example.

01:01:06
And then just to not transfer these conclusions

01:01:11
to Europe.

01:01:17
Many of the studies on neighborhood effects

01:01:22
and the effects of segregation have been conducted in the Netherlands.

01:01:27
And also this Dutch context is a very peculiar one.

01:01:31
Where, for example, concerns about the value,

01:01:34
and also to see there, or particularly neighborhoods

01:01:39
in Amsterdam have been quite important in stimulating

01:01:47
research field. And being for dying, I don't know whether you're interested in going.

01:01:55
But this far-right whole addition to the Netherlands have always been proper for two decades already, have been kept forward.

01:02:03
And that's also important to understand why this research field has been sort of developed in the Netherlands.

01:02:10
So important to provincialized students and to understand that a study in Vienna or in

01:02:16
Antwerp or in Brussels or in the United States that it's important to contextualize,

01:02:21
to understand the specificities of this particular context.

01:02:26
I have seven answers to this question.

01:02:28
Have you remember the question?

01:02:31
Can impoverished neighborhoods make the residents

01:02:34
worse off or when I'm interested in

01:02:38
ethnic cultural segregation and neighborhoods

01:02:43
with the concentration of people for origin

01:02:45
make integration more difficult?

01:02:52
Um, seven different arguments.

01:02:55
The first one, the social network

01:03:03
I think many of you might have heard of Robert Pootman, focusing on social capital,

01:03:08
but the social capital, the connections among the visuals, the social networks, the

01:03:10
norms of reciprocity.

01:03:15
There's the rules of desiring and trustworthiness that arise from, making a distinction

01:03:20
between holding capital, what is falling capital.

01:03:27
These are social methods, connections, loans, or reciprocity that means socially homogeneous

01:03:28
people.

01:03:34
For example, people of the same ethnicity are people of the same social and economic group.

01:03:39
Distinction between only and bridging them of the preaching of the capital, being connections,

01:03:46
that works, loans, and reciprocity, and transporatiness, being socially heterogeneous.

01:03:53
For example, people of different ethnic countries are people of different social economies.

01:04:00
And the argument is often that rich in capital is important for social mobility.

01:04:09
And for example, if you're poor from your middle class neighbor, you will meet here about

01:04:10
jobs.

01:04:12
And it is a version who's working.

01:04:14
And there is a job opportunity that

01:04:17
office workers, persons, persons in my chair is

01:04:20
knowledge, but she might share it with his

01:04:22
worker name.

01:04:26
Work and ready to do not speak Dutch, it might

01:04:28
be good to have this wide middle class

01:04:31
family, this university council.

01:04:34
So interested in living next to you, because

01:04:38
you maybe they can help yourself or go

01:04:41
with homework as they speak.

01:04:46
So these are the ideas behind this argument,

01:04:50
saying, well, it's good to have mixed neighborhoods,

01:04:55
because this mixed neighborhoods with leads to heterogeneous networks

01:04:58
that will lead to bridging capital,

01:05:00
and that will make importance.

01:05:05
That will be to the benefit of poor people living in such an effort.

01:05:09
And so one reason why you would want to create a social

01:05:14
expert is because you want to create heterogeneous social

01:05:15
networks.

01:05:20
Because you assume that rich in capital will help poor people

01:05:23
to be socially mobile and to join with it.

01:05:28
And for example, through education or through jobs.

01:05:32
And so this is one of the seven arguments

01:05:36
that underpins this ideal of social works.

01:05:41
But I'm going to study how people live.

01:05:46
It turns out that people are rather mobile in a city

01:05:51
to not limit their lives to a particular neighborhood.

01:05:53
And that many of the social networks

01:05:55
that people in a neighborhood spend

01:05:57
different neighborhood borders.

01:06:02
And this is a study from Guangzhou in China.

01:06:06
looking at the social networks of people living in four different types of

01:06:11
neighborhoods and in each of these neighborhoods the conclusion is that most

01:06:23
people get to know people through work and spend time with colleagues also after

01:06:31
after working hours. Many people also get to know people through kinship from a

01:06:33
childhood to schools of

01:06:35
graduate children.

01:06:38
And then are actually quite

01:06:41
a small amount of

01:06:43
social mentors in each of these

01:06:45
neighborhoods, less than that

01:06:47
percent.

01:06:50
And, well, you look at the

01:06:52
social connections of these people.

01:06:54
There's quite a small amount that

01:06:56
helps in these neighborhoods.

01:06:58
And no matter the reach of the four

01:07:00
types of neighborhoods that

01:07:04
People seem to develop mostly boats,

01:07:11
connections in that works with people from outside this language.

01:07:15
And so this idea that by bringing the middle of the last work,

01:07:18
the middle of the last two of the middle of the neighborhood,

01:07:22
that this would be a way to create these social networks.

01:07:27
And when you look at this, then the social networks also develop outside.

01:07:31
So why do you focus so much on that neighborhood that people live?

01:07:38
I'm just very

01:07:43
[inaudible]

01:07:46
In other countries you mean

01:07:48
the situation would be different.

01:07:56
I told you it's important to understand the complex

01:07:58
and the context of this study.

01:08:01
But in any case, also for which

01:08:03
that European cities, if you're

01:08:06
a study, this process is over time.

01:08:07
I think you would find out that

01:08:11
connections are less neighborhood-based

01:08:12
than they used to.

01:08:14
I can imagine that this neighborhood

01:08:17
is more than being an organ.

01:08:19
People still get to know a lot

01:08:23
of other families, for example,

01:08:26
through their children, through the school,

01:08:27
in many countries of the world.

01:08:29
You have a school kitchen system

01:08:30
where living in a neighborhood

01:08:32
and sending your kids to the same school.

01:08:35
And so for sure there are many reasons

01:08:39
why this would be different in other countries.

01:08:43
Have an overall, I think this argument is still true

01:08:45
that there are also many social networks

01:08:48
that have outside the neighborhood.

01:08:50
Of course, I also studies that focus on

01:08:51
foreign neighborhoods and say,

01:08:54
well, these people are less mobile and rich people.

01:08:58
So it's exactly for the school people that this neighborhood is an important

01:09:06
ground of network for each. Much more than this one, which you know.

01:09:17
If you do not have a joke, if you do not have the money to buy a best-in-game club, that is neighborhood context will be a form of form for social networks to develop.

01:09:21
So also for different countries, people this might be.

01:09:27
But still I think it's important to see that that merge is another one we've felt inside

01:09:28
the paper.

01:09:36
That there are also networks in other parts of the city, or with people living in other parts

01:09:39
of the city.

01:09:45
German, drawing, white, double-inkled,

01:09:51
families to a neighborhood such as molar make.

01:09:54
And here is possible, well, then

01:09:59
make these networks, a study by Sabina Rick

01:10:04
and like a un-person in German cities.

01:10:09
I think it was not explored in the food area.

01:10:13
And they have been interviewing the white,

01:10:17
middle class people in this example to women

01:10:19
about their social net.

01:10:20
And there's quite a lot on this diet,

01:10:22
everybody might need to explain it.

01:10:25
So you see they're women in the middle.

01:10:30
And then you have different scales in the neighborhoods.

01:10:31
You have the city.

01:10:35
You have Germany, and you have outside of Germany.

01:10:40
So people who are the important people in your life,

01:10:44
ask that, and if you put them on this diagram saying,

01:10:46
well, there are people inside the neighborhood,

01:10:48
people living in the same city,

01:10:50
but you also know people in the same country

01:10:52
and people also being grown.

01:10:56
And for different people, you would get to different diagrams.

01:11:01
Then what they also did is to map contact frequency.

01:11:08
So if you have frequent buildings, this arrow will be born both then it is for people through

01:11:11
you to have rare contacts.

01:11:19
And then they also have met a level of education and indicators for class in the Indian

01:11:20
countries.

01:11:28
So you will learn these people that you frequent are they people with the same educational

01:11:29
background.

01:11:32
They would cost people high education,

01:11:36
high-educated, or artists people who do not have

01:11:39
any personal qualifications for this one.

01:11:41
Now, the other thing that you see here

01:11:43
is the type of relation to a frequent

01:11:47
these people or really provide you with emotional support

01:11:51
or instrumental materials or a good talk,

01:11:53
or example, how to be used in poverty.

01:11:55
So it's quite a complex map.

01:12:02
So what you see is that first of all, just like in the Chinese example, many people have

01:12:09
social networks, there are Bartovus social networks with people living outside the neighborhoods.

01:12:15
And what you also see there is that most of the connections that these middle-class women

01:12:22
in these under-religious neighborhoods develop are with other people with the same

01:12:24
education qualification.

01:12:27
So the idea that bringing the middle of class people

01:12:29
to an underprivileged neighborhood

01:12:32
will create that an routine is social networks

01:12:35
in which you're finding more enriched people.

01:12:37
There's no single whole truth here.

01:12:39
There's a middle class people that's

01:12:41
you're attracted to these neighborhoods.

01:12:44
The eight mostly social bonds with people like them

01:12:46
with other middle and false people.

01:12:50
And so this bridging capital,

01:12:53
That was the reason why you wanted to exist,

01:12:54
neighborhood.

01:12:55
That's not really the problem.

01:13:04
Another argument is that creating a mixed neighborhood

01:13:09
might disrupt the strong dice that exist there over it.

01:13:12
The bolding capital that exists

01:13:14
and the strong forms of social economic,

01:13:18
emotional support that people are the same,

01:13:20
that Mississippi, for example, provides you

01:13:23
when they live in a neighborhood,

01:13:24
part of the city.

01:13:30
So residents living in distant parts of cities,

01:13:33
slaves are argued, fall back on what they know,

01:13:36
and what they have each other,

01:13:40
this building can also be crucial in the life's home

01:13:43
for people, in the lives of newcomers,

01:13:44
where just arrived to the city,

01:13:47
they were looked for all that excursed,

01:13:54
And if you create a mixed neighborhood in these parts of common, for example, by attracting

01:13:59
the middle class, there will display some people and that will disrupt these bone-in-capped

01:14:01
open-assists.

01:14:10
And so what I'm trying to do is to say, well, there is an argument there, why you would

01:14:14
to create mixed neighborhoods, which are also left

01:14:16
a couple of cancer arguments.

01:14:19
That's the why this argument is

01:14:21
by not to work or to hold a reason

01:14:24
and applying the argument to my not to work.

01:14:28
Social networks, social capital,

01:14:30
owning and bridging capital.

01:14:32
I guess you have a few kinds of points there.

01:14:38
The second argument is called under-place arguments.

01:14:43
And this is an argument that has developed in the United States

01:14:46
in the 1980s.

01:14:50
And then finding that there was a big discussion

01:14:55
between structuralists who looked at the causes of poverty

01:14:57
in the declining economic base.

01:15:01
And for example, Marxist, Trevor first saying, well, there

01:15:06
is a shift from a forest to a post-fortress capitalism.

01:15:10
And this makes it harder for this people to fight with chocolate.

01:15:15
or the arguments that you've heard in the classes by the past of our polarization,

01:15:19
is there a declining job market for this.

01:15:22
So you look for structure of a goal of a scope forward.

01:15:25
And on the other hand, you have culture groups,

01:15:30
except poverty is dead because you have a culture of poverty.

01:15:34
That poor people have certain attitudes,

01:15:38
have a certain behavior, and this keeps them in poverty.

01:15:43
there was an important discussion between these two.

01:15:47
And this under-class argument is part of this cultural

01:15:49
history of looking at forward.

01:15:53
And whom is this under-class?

01:15:56
They're not talking about all four people

01:15:58
in the case of the United States.

01:16:02
In the 1980s, 33 million people were not.

01:16:06
Who was this under-class that was a minority

01:16:09
in this minority, 5 million people.

01:16:13
And people who follow below the income threshold

01:16:17
for which they are like considered to work.

01:16:20
This proportionally black and spelling minority

01:16:23
in this poor minority, but what defines

01:16:26
that's not so much over the ordinary base,

01:16:28
but they're behavior.

01:16:31
They're throwing lawlessness,

01:16:37
to reduce out of record words, lack of a warm and welfare dependency

01:16:39
for school faith.

01:16:43
That is sort of this culture, this lane to the poor,

01:16:47
to be poor because of their own behavior and very

01:16:49
able to do this.

01:16:52
And so this is this under-class argument.

01:16:58
So what is the argument exactly that in kettles or in neighborhoods

01:17:04
So you find the concentration of two people that you find is more than an employment, more

01:17:11
welfare dependency, more early school living, more truancy, more criminality, more drug

01:17:18
abuse, more alcohol abuse, more out of rent with birth, more teenage pregnancy, more

01:17:26
dysfunctional values, whatever, that in June to socialization effects within

01:17:35
these things, if you grow up in a neighborhood like that, then your peers, people of

01:17:44
your age, the people that you're free and grow at a higher chance to be criminals or

01:17:49
or gamblers or drug users or alcohol abuse, etc.

01:17:54
And that is why in such a route you find more on this.

01:17:57
You also find a leg of role models really

01:18:00
junk without a drug without an alcohol

01:18:05
prediction and who are not the age followers, etc.

01:18:09
So there's a leg of those are the role models.

01:18:12
And you also have this peer group effect.

01:18:17
And so why are you worse off living as a poor person

01:18:20
in a poor neighborhood, the argument of this culture,

01:18:24
this was, that is because you have these norms,

01:18:26
you have a lack of these role models

01:18:30
and you have this peer group that makes it made that,

01:18:34
well, that's why it's your worst off living in them.

01:18:37
And I also referred to physical structure,

01:18:41
the solution of that works, the argument was, no.

01:18:43
This has been quite an important argument.

01:18:49
Many policymakers have been facing or helping

01:18:53
argue in first-person countries because of this.

01:18:59
Because they were convinced that living in an appornable

01:19:02
group increased the chances that you

01:19:05
found the job-less important thing.

01:19:09
These schools early and because of your friends doing the same,

01:19:14
you up to school because your friends met you so as well that you would

01:19:18
turn into a criminal because this is the example that you have seen most

01:19:21
they have already put that set up.

01:19:28
Okay now even when there would be a link between what is on the left and

01:19:32
the spoon neighborhoods then it can still be wondered whether that what is

01:19:37
the causal relationship between these two. Here on the map you have

01:19:41
She's got her again since we are getting quite familiar with.

01:19:45
You see the poverty level in this neighborhood.

01:19:50
The darker the reds, the poorer the neighborhoods are.

01:19:59
And you see people arrested for drug use or the

01:20:04
or the conversation of authors.

01:20:10
How you see there is that there is a correlation

01:20:16
between over D and the concentration of over D

01:20:20
is neighborhood and use of one of your while there, right?

01:20:24
Go getting the scratch scanner, which more is patterned.

01:20:32
But you also see that in the other neighborhoods where you have a concentration of poverty

01:20:34
that this much less begins.

01:20:46
And I can also wonder to what extent this graph is the result of real drug use or the

01:20:47
policing of these standards.

01:20:54
If you have a police force that is much more on the outlook for drug use instead of the

01:20:55
the name of the Goodswell bank.

01:20:59
It's logical that this will show up in any step distance.

01:21:02
So there are many reasons why one could raise

01:21:05
concerns about the goals of a relationship.

01:21:08
In this case, we could introduce, on the one hand,

01:21:11
and the concentration of over-theon public

01:21:14
on Goods, as Dr. Kritis says, like, how

01:21:16
these statistics came about.

01:21:18
One can also see that for certain drugs,

01:21:22
there seems to be a correlation from other certain health.

01:21:28
So I can also see that you have concentrated poverty that corresponds with a lot of errors

01:21:33
for drug use, but that you also have neighborhood with concentration concentrated poverty

01:21:35
or less, which means.

01:21:40
So there are many reasons why we would start a question whether there is a real causal

01:21:45
relationship, a relationship, a concentration of poverty on the one hand, and all these

01:21:51
other indicators here on the slide on the other hand.

01:22:01
And another argument against this under-class argument would be, well, again, socialization

01:22:05
be these peers to not only live in these neighborhoods.

01:22:10
These role models do not only live in the neighborhood, but where I go back, but also

01:22:18
in the neighborhood, that we can get this role almost 23 or the music that we're going to

01:22:22
So why is focused on the neighborhood again?

01:22:27
Third argument, the social cohesion argument.

01:22:36
Here you see the basic line of thought of this argument,

01:22:41
when ethnic minorities live isolated from native touch,

01:22:44
they have less contact with native touch.

01:22:46
Consequently, they do not acquire

01:22:51
an adequate command of the Dutch language are not likely to adopt

01:22:56
Dutch laws, values, and will not succeed in social recognitions.

01:23:04
So, you can see a mixing of arguments about ethnic segregation and social

01:23:10
economic mobility, saying that well, if you're lived in a neighborhood with a high

01:23:16
concentration of people of foreign backgrounds to speak their mother tongue

01:23:20
and we will be able to speak in touch.

01:23:25
And if you have less contact with native Dutch people,

01:23:30
then you will not acquire an adequate command of language.

01:23:33
You are not likely to adopt Dutch moments and values,

01:23:37
and therefore you succeed in social networks.

01:23:43
And other arguments that has been quite important

01:23:48
In the kind of rethorex and the kind of discourse of policy makers

01:23:52
that are advocating a social mix, same for example,

01:23:55
it's not good that in wall make you have a high-down

01:23:59
situation of firms or in both the larger, high-down situation of workers.

01:24:01
Why is that not good?

01:24:03
Well, these people will not get to speak.

01:24:08
Touch and they will not integrate to use that word.

01:24:12
They will not adopt touch laws and values

01:24:17
and that will make it harder for them to climb to social weather.

01:24:22
Again, one can wonder, yeah, is it only in the neighborhood

01:24:27
that people could get a chance to develop this kind of relationships

01:24:31
with native Dutch human arguments to talk to.

01:24:34
We could look at these research, too.

01:24:38
I'm not going to do all the details that they say about you.

01:24:42
home, that's a place where people develop social networks.

01:24:43
You've got leisure,

01:24:44
you've got digital,

01:24:45
you've got mental health,

01:24:47
social networks,

01:24:48
you've got work,

01:24:50
and you've got the transport between

01:24:52
these three different domains.

01:24:55
So it's important to look at all these domains

01:24:57
and to see what happens between people.

01:24:59
And then you might see that this neighborhood

01:25:02
in which these people live is less important.

01:25:05
Another counter-argument with focus

01:25:08
or is a local culture.

01:25:11
It's only because you have a concentration

01:25:15
of people who are certain ethnic background, for example,

01:25:20
that you can support the show that sells ethnic products

01:25:24
and sell the food, that sells the food from the home group,

01:25:28
where it allows you to have the church or a association

01:25:32
that focusing on a particular ethnic group.

01:25:35
And these kinds of places might be very important.

01:25:37
they will act as a perfected space,

01:25:39
they will act as a safe space,

01:25:42
in which these people feel like they're home.

01:25:44
And this feeling of belonging might be very important

01:25:49
for them to find a life in this new country

01:25:52
where they are living.

01:25:55
The social cohesion argument.

01:26:02
Before the argument, we'll focus on local services.

01:26:11
And we'll say that, for example, in neighborhoods

01:26:14
with the concentration of poverty that you

01:26:16
will have less public and private services.

01:26:18
There will be less shops.

01:26:21
There will be less banks.

01:26:24
And you might also have less public service.

01:26:27
These are examples from Luvibong, social housing

01:26:31
estate that I've been talking about today already.

01:26:33
and the closure of a bank.

01:26:37
And there is no ADM anymore in other papers.

01:26:39
And the argument could go well

01:26:41
if that would be more middle to false people

01:26:43
than there would be higher interest

01:26:47
from banks who have an ADM in the bank

01:26:52
or other shops.

01:26:58
Chicago, food deserts, I don't know

01:27:00
that you've ever heard about this term.

01:27:05
If you look at healthy food, grocery,

01:27:08
shops, American, you find that,

01:27:13
if you see a map with these different racial groups,

01:27:17
remember this self identification in the case,

01:27:22
America that deserve each racial group to self identify

01:27:23
with the United States.

01:27:26
You see neighborhoods, predominantly white,

01:27:28
like Hispanic Asian, a nurse,

01:27:32
and you see that in many of these blank neighborhoods,

01:27:34
which are also luxurious neighborhoods,

01:27:38
you find that it's very hard to find.

01:27:40
Healthy food that's very hard to find fresh vegetables

01:27:43
and fruit, because these shops are so fine.

01:27:47
And so the argument would be that its better degree,

01:27:49
it makes neighborhood, because that will attract

01:27:54
a library set of shops and services to these neighborhoods.

01:27:59
We've already been talking about this,

01:28:02
that the question of course is what kind of shops

01:28:04
and what kind of services do you get

01:28:08
in the case of this end to our advantage of this street

01:28:09
one person said, well,

01:28:12
the people will not feel affordable shops

01:28:14
and they will also not find the products

01:28:16
that apply to five shops.

01:28:20
That's also in gentrifying neighborhoods

01:28:24
and what kind of shops do you find there?

01:28:31
as it shows catering for people who look for the cheapest or possible because they have

01:28:41
only five heroes to spend in the last three days of the month, or visit cafes or restaurants

01:28:46
who try to cater for these incoming, tenured pups.

01:28:53
So it's important to look at the difference in the amount that will result from creating

01:28:59
and so the question is if you mix name routes through these shops and services

01:29:04
cater for these cool people because if there's something case then it will

01:29:10
displace the shops that existed there already and that cater for these

01:29:15
audience. The answer we've also been talking about all of these specialized

01:29:23
services that you might get in neighborhoods of Rhode Island at these ony transfer

01:29:30
or a full shot set of African vegetables or high ingredients.

01:29:36
And the question is if you try to mix the neighborhoods,

01:29:42
do these kinds of shops and these kinds of services still be able to be to remain

01:29:49
or will they also be displaced because this place will be involved by a fancy

01:29:52
see, probably shown that it's mainly

01:29:55
catarities and changing farmers.

01:29:58
So questions around shops, services,

01:30:03
catering for different audits.

01:30:06
A fifth argument that you find in the literature

01:30:08
is a political one.

01:30:13
Start from the observation that many neighborhood associations,

01:30:18
for example are mainly run by middle class.

01:30:23
And that middle class people are much more vocal

01:30:26
in expressing their concerns from the paper.

01:30:28
So I'm gonna say that, well,

01:30:32
by attracting the middle class to a poor neighborhood,

01:30:33
this neighborhood will be higher

01:30:35
for the political agenda.

01:30:40
And I have this quote interprome

01:30:42
and I have read at the end of the excursion,

01:30:44
which I've got a lot in my channel,

01:30:46
for people stating,

01:30:49
"Well, there also gets paid or sliding to this."

01:30:50
To us.

01:30:54
And so the idea is that I'm mixing neighborhoods,

01:30:57
you will put these neighborhoods higher.

01:31:02
Jen, I'm in Belgium, people from outside the youth

01:31:07
with other buildings in Oxford are able to fold

01:31:13
this film not getting case in every country, so if you have a neighborhood with a lot of people

01:31:19
from outside the group, who do not have a say in vocal politics, then why would this

01:31:26
vocal mayors address the concerns of people living? And if these people are not able to

01:31:33
express their needs and to put a stamp on the vocal agenda, but why would you do it?

01:31:40
So the argument is that really class people are able to have these connections with politicians

01:31:43
or at least they will be listened to.

01:31:56
Well, I'm not going to go into that example, but it's out with the enter of highway

01:32:00
that issue of air pollution to be observation

01:32:04
with both of the paper groups lying next to the library

01:32:05
are up.

01:32:08
So one would question what would happen

01:32:12
with this whole issue of the only dates around the highway.

01:32:15
If these neighborhoods would want to,

01:32:17
to neighbors, the voters would come,

01:32:19
the broader than they would be the highest

01:32:23
if they would be the show that they did.

01:32:27
So the political arguments by mixing neighborhoods,

01:32:30
you will put that higher on the political agenda.

01:32:34
Of course, the issue is that why we put the issues of this,

01:32:38
who even, why does that not have priorities

01:32:40
made for the result of the political agenda,

01:32:44
without these middle-class residents.

01:32:47
The sixth argument is a bit different.

01:32:49
The spatial mismatch does not focus so much

01:32:52
on the issue of segregation.

01:32:55
But if you follow these five dimensions of--

01:33:04
We see a benefit it focuses on concentration plus red doe pool people live in which part

01:33:10
of the city are these neighborhoods with the concentration of poverty.

01:33:16
This is a diagram from Cape Town but in old London it's still very much the case.

01:33:23
Where do you have a job of her students in white and where do you have population?

01:33:28
where do people live and where do they, where, where could they?

01:33:34
And most of the drug opportunities are still in the previous new white neighborhoods, particularly

01:33:37
in the central business district of Cape Town.

01:33:44
But most of the poor people in Cape Town are living by far away from these places.

01:33:49
So there is a mismatch between the places where they live and the places where they could

01:33:51
potential, burning.

01:33:55
And so it's not just important to focus on segregation

01:33:58
and the fact that poverty is concentrated

01:34:00
in these more peripheral neighborhoods

01:34:02
in the case of big dive.

01:34:04
The genetic focus then also of distance

01:34:06
between various neighborhoods are

01:34:09
and the places where these people put through.

01:34:11
So there is the spatial mismatch

01:34:14
are focusing on the mismatch between

01:34:19
place of residence and potential places of the world.

01:34:28
Rest in European cities, then to have a better public transport than most American for

01:34:29
cyber.

01:34:34
So one of the other big issues is argument to the whole list through in the case of Brussels

01:34:41
for example, even if you live in a field world, there are good train connections to

01:34:53
of nature places. This is a meant for Brussels, Joe Ben City, you see two clusters, the inner city,

01:35:01
and all these offices, and the area around the airport. Where the poor people in Brussels

01:35:09
lived mostly in this 19th century, boats around the inner city, meaning that there's not so

01:35:11
So much of the spatial mismatch.

01:35:15
If you live in all of make, you can walk to many job opportunities.

01:35:17
Of course, the question that this barely

01:35:21
have most guilt job opportunities.

01:35:24
Or if you don't need all of communication,

01:35:27
then you see that more or less the same clusters

01:35:28
appear.

01:35:33
Of course, as jokes shift towards the airport,

01:35:36
the issue is what are the transport connections

01:35:40
between Wollumbeg, St. Joseph, the Wollus, and Joseph,

01:35:44
and these areas where you find the growth

01:35:48
of most new, or most new jobs.

01:35:51
And in the case of Brussels, the issue will also be,

01:35:54
whether the language requirements for these jobs,

01:35:57
because these are Joseph flowers,

01:36:02
what kind of a touch proficiency to a need,

01:36:04
and also for these jobs that are repulsion, French,

01:36:09
and you also English, so just language wise,

01:36:13
these jobs are already quite difficult.

01:36:16
So the spatial mismatch argument focusing

01:36:19
on the location of these poor neighbors.

01:36:23
So it's not just how mixed these neighborhoods are,

01:36:24
whether poor and rich, they decide

01:36:27
by side, but where do these concentrations

01:36:29
of overty occur?

01:36:33
Last argument statement is each,

01:36:37
And this is an argument that Slater has been writing about

01:36:40
is important to look what happens outside

01:36:43
of these neighborhoods under scrutiny.

01:36:47
And why is it harder to climb the social weather

01:36:49
and body of it on all of the developments

01:36:53
because teachers who live outside these neighborhoods

01:36:58
from where the set of stereotypes or pupils in these schools

01:37:02
and that will look different at the same educational

01:37:06
chances as people going to school in other meetings.

01:37:09
Or if you're both going to this, and you know

01:37:11
what is the post-code report, what made with you,

01:37:14
apply for a joke, then you, okay,

01:37:16
you're one thousand meters.

01:37:19
If you have a driver, a joke, and this is your address

01:37:22
is there, then potential and borders

01:37:24
might already come to the center of stereotypes,

01:37:27
why not too high?

01:37:32
So why would it be good then to create the social mix?

01:37:36
Well, one could create a one-point argue for a social mix

01:37:40
because that will reduce the stigma of attitudes

01:37:44
or the stigma attached to this gap.

01:37:47
Of course, there might also be other ways

01:37:49
to work on that stigma.

01:37:51
You don't need a mix to do that.

01:37:53
You also can make people living outside this neighborhood.

01:37:56
So you can make that more air off.

01:38:00
And what this really happens is silence and the difference.

01:38:03
There's a bit of stigmatization, life of nature,

01:38:07
employers or teachers or police men

01:38:08
who are working in this neighborhood,

01:38:10
but who do not live there,

01:38:16
will be another argument to buy social mix is necessary.

01:38:22
So are people living in impoverished prisons?

01:38:25
Well, doesn't matter whether you are poor,

01:38:30
mostly poor neighborhoods surrounded by people like you.

01:38:34
or whether you live as a poor person in a mixed name.

01:38:35
Just that matter.

01:38:39
And our seventh arguments that I have given down

01:38:41
as to why that could matter.

01:38:44
For each of these seven,

01:38:47
I've also given a couple of counter-audicates.

01:38:52
As to why I creating a mixed,

01:38:55
it should be a bad thing to distract,

01:38:58
to advise that exists already.

01:39:04
are is not necessary because people find peers and role models outside the environment.

01:39:13
For people with a class, people arrive in these neighborhoods, well not create social networks,

01:39:19
different people, this better order, etc. So for each of these arguments, I've given

01:39:29
a couple of counter arguments. What about the privilege? I will skip that. But in

01:39:37
those data spaper you will find many arguments for that. I will get to a small conclusion.

01:39:45
Okay, so when we discuss this ideal of social mix, when we discuss the question of

01:39:50
which is social mixed feasible, is social mixed desirable.

01:39:52
Now, when it's my take on it, I think,

01:39:55
of his home and we,

01:39:57
who has been doing a lot of vertical housing

01:39:59
here in Brussels,

01:40:01
has summarized this quite well through.

01:40:05
The concept of social mixed here runs,

01:40:08
which now legitimizes a good part

01:40:11
of the regional interventions

01:40:14
in the area of housing here in Brussels,

01:40:17
just looking at the Brussels step of the region

01:40:20
and how the idea of social mixed-minded concept

01:40:25
of social mixed-

01:40:29
is occurring to a very non-spading conference,

01:40:33
the gentrification reaches underweight

01:40:35
in the central neighborhoods,

01:40:40
in those neighborhoods where these authorities are doing

01:40:44
in a big effort to attract valid possible products.

01:40:48
Indicates that when there is a mix,

01:40:53
it is only a prelude to the eviction of the most disadvantaged

01:40:56
fire the mechanisms of a completely

01:40:59
deteriorated real estate market.

01:41:01
Really in a city,

01:41:06
where only 10% of the total residential units

01:41:14
our social house, and there is almost no control over the remaining 90%.

01:41:25
And so if you try to attract little class residents to these 19th century industrial labor books

01:41:30
around Brussels, if you do that, then it will push out over the elsewhere. You see that in the

01:41:35
the snap of a tree, where there are these poor people moving out of a gentrifying

01:41:42
nature, started it both to build on to oust, to really get into the hollow, to

01:41:48
shower the water, to my shadow. Yeah, you move over the elsewhere. So when there

01:41:54
is a mix, you can exist for a while, but then it's only a privilege to be a

01:42:00
fiction of most is a fantasy. Because rents will go up eventually. And these poor

01:42:03
people that live there are not able to afford these rents,

01:42:07
they will need to move elsewhere to find the next mistake.

01:42:11
So this social makes feasible in the case of Brussels,

01:42:17
with very little control of authorities on the housing market.

01:42:21
No, this is not feasible, shall we?

01:42:22
Is it desirable?

01:42:24
A second question that I asked.

01:42:28
Even if this eviction could be a forked,

01:42:35
And even if you think of a situation where at much, 25% social housing everywhere, 50%

01:42:39
and you will not evict these poor people from these neighborhoods,

01:42:47
then she argues there is nothing to indicate that these disadvantaged populations would eventually

01:42:50
benefit in any rate from these nips.

01:42:57
F1 because the attraction of this middle league penalties will change the shops for

01:43:05
a regular, will not lead to these heterogeneous networks that these policy makers three

01:43:05
and off.

01:43:16
Yeah, will not lead to the kind of social cohesion that underlies this social cohesion.

01:43:23
does not make the kind of role models that people who

01:43:27
believe in the spendery class argument

01:43:29
who are looking for, et cetera.

01:43:32
And so she's arguing in the case of Brussels again,

01:43:36
it's important to revitalize these studies

01:43:39
and to understand the complexity of the Brussels case

01:43:43
only 10% social housing over the at this moment

01:43:47
concentrated in neighborhoods with quite a critical

01:43:50
very close to these jobs.

01:43:54
And so there are many particularities that we need to understand.

01:43:58
But what is arguing is that kind of social mix

01:44:01
that this person's capital picture tries to create

01:44:04
leads to the displacement of people,

01:44:06
to neighborhoods, to parts of the city,

01:44:10
which are much less connected to job opportunities.

01:44:15
I refined much less jobs and services that paid the for this.

01:44:16
That's right.

01:44:20
So to much worse locations actually.

01:44:23
And even if this kind of mixed could be realized,

01:44:27
she argues, then this is not desirable.

01:44:30
Then this advantage population will not benefit from this.

01:44:34
This will not help them to plan the social better.

01:44:38
As she will draw on all the seven counter arguments

01:44:44
that I've given to substantiate this claim.

01:44:56
So, well, I think when you, I remember that I once asked an exam question such as

01:45:01
"would yourself you choose all the manner of N-word, do another manner of N-word, but

01:45:06
you verbal against social mixed policies or not?"

01:45:09
The question was a bit more complicated.

01:45:13
I think it's important that when you have such a question,

01:45:16
when you have a group for a city already

01:45:19
who has discussed this from an academic point of view,

01:45:21
I think there are a couple of questions

01:45:24
that you need to ask yourself.

01:45:25
Yes.

01:45:28
The first one is whom are we talking about?

01:45:30
Why do we treat?

01:45:34
Why do we want to create a social mix?

01:45:37
Isn't because we say, well, this is the interest

01:45:42
under privilege or I've skipped now most of this at heart.

01:45:45
The class could also be interested in the privilege.

01:45:48
I mean, I'm a member of the original Scout,

01:45:53
one of the richer, richer richest municipalities of Belgium

01:45:55
and some of you said well,

01:45:58
it could be good to have some more diverse

01:46:02
years because people like, for example,

01:46:04
change the way they think about people

01:46:07
they have some of them living close by.

01:46:33
You see that all of the arguments so far have been dealing with the unknown group. So for that reason, I think it's important to ask your question, what about the crucial questions. And in the discussion, seven years that we as next week, there will be one paper that happens together with the real male and post-galbert, they could deal with the question. So we have a chance to come back to the issue.

01:46:36
and we have discussions.

01:46:41
Do we only focus on social economic segregation?

01:46:46
Are we also interested in ethnic arguments?

01:46:47
And you're seeing, for example,

01:46:52
a social cohesion argument, the two are conflated.

01:46:55
So do we want to create a social mix

01:46:57
in the interest of ethnic minorities

01:47:00
or does that have a majority,

01:47:04
that still exists because more and more cities

01:47:08
in Belgium do not have a majority of people.

01:47:11
So we also think about this group,

01:47:15
frankly, to problemate such policies.

01:47:20
Are we interested in the several residents who

01:47:23
are there already, who are we mainly thinking

01:47:26
about few cops for the horizons?

01:47:29
So I think this question for whom

01:47:31
So we want to create a social experience.

01:47:37
And most interests is the first one that you should ask.

01:47:41
A second one is the issue of scale.

01:47:43
I told you last week already, scale

01:47:45
is the crux of the matter.

01:47:49
If you want to calculate segregation finishes,

01:47:52
it matters that we scale, we do so.

01:47:55
In Belgium, we have the straightest small statistical units

01:48:01
for that reason, we find that that's high levels of segregation.

01:48:04
And if you would make these statistical units bigger,

01:48:08
then that would be less segregation.

01:48:12
Your comment about the red square relates to this.

01:48:16
We can create a social mix in this very small neighborhood.

01:48:19
And if you would look at the bigger picture,

01:48:22
if you would look at this A-monch in area of emperor,

01:48:26
as well as all the news found out that there is no social business,

01:48:29
it's mostly relative to a certain level.

01:48:33
So I think scale is a very important issue,

01:48:38
as well as the question where do we want to create a social business.

01:48:43
I think that most of the social mixed literature

01:48:46
is concerned with this disadvantage, neighborhoods.

01:48:49
The focus is on these neighborhoods

01:48:51
and the need to create a social business.

01:48:57
If you would look at all the make, you would look at social economic position of people.

01:49:02
If you would look at ethnic maker of this neighborhood, you would find out that the

01:49:09
whole make is maybe the most social image's name roots of Russell's original culture.

01:49:15
And the most of the homogeneous neighborhoods are white suburban municipalities.

01:49:19
So why are we only concerned with this disadvantage

01:49:20
neighborhoods?

01:49:25
How are we not concerned with the homogeneity

01:49:28
of many of these suburban groups?

01:49:29
Which are better off.

01:49:33
Is there a need to create a social mixed slope or not?

01:49:36
And I've imbed a shout for those who join to enter by

01:49:39
be talking about the way they protest that they

01:49:42
can't stop training against the local asylum center

01:49:51
against any attempts to make this an usability.

01:49:54
One good even argued that most of the literature and most

01:49:57
of the concerns of policy leaders

01:50:02
target only those this advantage neighborhoods,

01:50:06
which are change-refiable, which have the potential

01:50:09
to attract really close newcomers.

01:50:11
Because that's good for them.

01:50:15
Next, then the question becomes rare is this possible.

01:50:19
And then enter, we have been on the triangle,

01:50:22
square, bowling plank.

01:50:28
But if you look at the houses, there are many fancy houses,

01:50:33
which are potential homes for rich families.

01:50:38
If you move more to the north, you only find

01:50:43
very small houses which will never attract this kind of.

01:50:46
Rarely I have debates about social mix,

01:50:49
about the needs to gentrify neighborhoods well.

01:50:50
Only in certain,

01:50:54
you know, limited amount of this is a factor.

01:51:00
So I think this rare question is an important,

01:51:04
rare, are we interested in data social issues?

01:51:06
You know, notice that these discussions focus

01:51:09
of a very limited number of neighborhoods.

01:51:15
Another issue is never discussed in other parts of the city.

01:51:19
It's also important to look at the issue of scaling

01:51:23
already discussed that, here again, many of our maps

01:51:27
only focus on and for the Russell's capital region.

01:51:31
But I've told you that many of these waterbed effects

01:51:34
have consequences in other parts of the urban region

01:51:37
or even other parts on the bench.

01:51:40
If housing prices in Brussels, Europe,

01:51:43
this has effects in

01:51:45
shall I want, this makes us walking around in

01:51:48
my shape of hope and see the poverty there.

01:51:51
And for we go to the proposal,

01:51:54
the filmmaking French, quite far away from Brussels

01:51:56
and we see these effects there,

01:51:58
or need over needed care.

01:52:01
All these municipalities are affected

01:52:03
by this gentrification.

01:52:10
So it's important that we discuss this issue at the scale of at this deep urban region.

01:52:18
So for whom, in whose interest do we want to create social mixed layer?

01:52:19
Do we want to do it?

01:52:22
Which neighborhoods are we actually talking about?

01:52:27
And then I think it's also important to focus on this wide question.

01:52:34
If you want to create a social use to counter-operatively or even to stimulate the

01:52:41
sculptural integration, then I think that there might be many policy alternatives which

01:52:46
are less costly and which may have much bigger effects.

01:52:54
I'm not going to go too much to do this, but you can imagine that you can try to combat

01:53:04
poverty, not through the spatial intervention, but through other kinds of social and welfare

01:53:12
that's correct. Is it to improve the local text bits? We've seen this course from this elder man

01:53:18
who gets, I think for many dozens, it still will be an important one. Why do we find gentrification

01:53:27
important. And why do we want to attract the middle class to the city? It is because then it's good

01:53:35
to learn our views of budget. But then even then, I will always be this very coloring of this is

01:53:41
in the interest of who people have included. And this will eventually help them by the social

01:53:46
that. Create social mixed-to-counter racist or

01:53:53
pluses stereotypes. What will that mean? I guess that would mean that we would

01:54:00
rethink rare and for whom we try to create a social mix. You see that in most

01:54:08
of the policy discourse this is quite absent. If stigmatization is one of

01:54:19
other reasons why living in Poland or for a government or come to a different world makes your life more difficult than other parts of the city.

01:54:22
It's a bit about stigmatization and discrimination.

01:54:28
Now what kind of spatial interventions can be needed to counter these stereotypes.

01:54:33
I think you would create social mixing of the three different ways.

01:54:45
So this is a bit of an open ended conclusion with a lot of questions, but I hope that by giving

01:54:52
your arguments for social mixed and cancer arguments against and by encouraging your

01:54:59
to think about the context in which you want to create a social mixed or not that you

01:55:07
are able to think critically about the effects of segregation and needs to create a social

01:55:09
mix or much.

01:55:19
And five plus seven, I propose that we almost leave it here for now.

01:55:24
We still have time to discuss all these issues next week in the seminar.

01:55:29
All these texts will deal again with patterns of segregation

01:55:30
and the effects are safe.

01:55:36
So I think it's good that we have time to discuss this next week,

01:55:41
Monday for the geographers and the people from planning

01:55:44
and have our students.

01:55:47
Is this information correct?

01:55:51
Next week Monday, we have eight papers in presentations

01:55:53
to discuss.

01:55:56
I don't see any comments.

01:55:59
So I suppose that this is the schedule as it is.

01:56:03
And then next week, Tuesday and Thursday,

01:56:09
we have two other seminars for students from MUSH

01:56:11
and Thursday students from four cities.

01:56:14
Yeah?

01:56:16
Is that correct?

01:56:19
Yes, all your presentations are there.

01:56:20
You find your names.

01:56:29
This is the information that I've learned from the ovens, 10 minutes.

01:56:35
And we will need to be a rather strict, more distracting,

01:56:43
that's maximum, especially having eight presentations in the first

01:56:44
seminar.

01:56:52
But also in the other seminars, I prefer to keep the time and

01:56:55
through limit these presentations to 10 minutes

01:56:58
because otherwise there's nothing applied for discussion.

01:57:01
These are discussions and not presentations.

01:57:05
So, limit your presentations to 10 minutes

01:57:07
include a slide with title, names, email,

01:57:10
I don't know all of you, so it's important

01:57:12
that I'm able to mark the presentations

01:57:15
and connect with the script arise students.

01:57:18
Remember that I need a core report or argument,

01:57:21
a link with the required readings.

01:57:25
Remember that we also expect all students

01:57:29
who have read all the papers of the required readings.

01:57:32
So I suppose that Slater has been read

01:57:35
by thanking all of our gentlemen and dessert.

01:57:38
And then they spoke a gentle vibe of children.

01:57:43
And then important in order to not to lose too much time

01:57:49
with technical issues, I would like all of you

01:57:54
to send to our power ports or ETF or whatever you're going to support your presentation.

01:58:01
At least 30 minutes before the seminar, to my email address, whether we transfer link to

01:58:09
necessary, if you want me to check with the presentation, perhaps on my computer, it's

01:58:13
a seven-year, but I suggest you to do that.

01:58:19
So maybe already evening before, and then ask me if you check with it, the power of

01:58:23
one's bird's room, doing it in a PDF so that the different power of one's versions

01:58:26
things change my eyes to change.

01:58:32
At least then, before the presentation, so there are items I'm to present in the future,

01:58:41
so let me go to the sign with the sorting of laptops and the laptops that can't make

01:58:49
a connection with the screen. Just to make sure that we are all able to present,

01:58:55
let me have time to discuss the papers and then we also allow us to discuss everything

01:58:56
that has been said.

01:58:59
and lost it.

01:59:03
Okay, now I'm going forward to see you next week.

01:59:10

[ Inaudible ]

02:01:33
[ Inaudible ]

02:01:40
[ Inaudible ]

02:02:09
and we are trying to teach by the information. And then we are going to have a question. And then we are going to have someone with a question. And I guess I am going to say that we are going to do that. And then we have a question. So, we have a question. So, we have a question. And then these people have been added to the list.

02:02:14
Okay, yeah, but I've always did the toughest of one guy.

02:02:19
She had emailed through 40, two or thousands of kids.

02:02:22
She said, "Well, I can't assume the flight."

02:02:24
And it's a good list.

02:02:27
Maybe that could be a main death.

02:02:30
Yeah, who knew her, but I could show her.

02:02:34
If not for next week, then for...

02:02:35
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:36
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:37
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:38
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:39
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:40
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:41
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:42
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:43
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:44
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:45
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:46
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:47
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:48
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:49
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:50
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:51
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:52
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:53
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:54
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:55
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:56
I think it's a good idea.

02:02:58
Okay. Yeah.

02:03:01
I'm wondering if I want to get my work on the other hand.

02:03:02
So yeah.

02:03:06
I think I get the answer from Adam, for example.

02:03:08
That's what I think.

02:03:10
But maybe.

02:03:11
Yeah.

02:03:12
That's what I think.

02:03:13
Yeah.

02:03:17
My mother was in the schedule and I felt like it's the...

02:03:18
But that was the last thing.

02:03:21
And I wanted to schedule for a run.

02:03:23
These students as well.

02:03:26
but also it's things when I see it.

02:03:29
So I don't know how to use these blue key.

02:03:31
Yeah, sounds.

02:03:32
Okay.

02:03:35
So I can go through the window below.

02:03:36
Okay.

02:03:37
Okay.

02:03:39
We're on this side.

02:03:40
Yes.

02:03:41
Thank you.

02:03:42
Thank you.

02:03:45
I want to--

02:03:46
I want to--

02:03:47
Okay.

02:03:50
I'm actually thinking about we have to write for four

02:03:52
[INAUDIBLE]

02:03:54
[INAUDIBLE]

02:03:56
[INAUDIBLE]

02:03:58
[INAUDIBLE]

02:04:00
[INAUDIBLE]

02:04:04
[INAUDIBLE]

02:04:06
[INAUDIBLE]

02:04:08
[INAUDIBLE]

02:04:11
So the first thing is, can we

02:04:14
call like any project that aims to attract

02:04:19
and the quality of life in a neighborhood like this.

02:04:25
Don't blame the taxi in this kind of project.

02:04:27
Can we call the our social mix projects?

02:04:30
But they also have a project.

02:04:34
So, we should also say that that's 100%.

02:04:36
That's a little.

02:04:43
Or, or, if still that, not really just.

02:05:10
infr

02:05:22
and so we're seeing that people are too busy, they're important to attract another guy and he's seen this.

02:05:30
So then you can see that this is what things are.

02:05:39
Do you have any few have already some references that talk about Brussels when I feel

02:05:45
I'm also in the presentation I've not shown that there is quite a rich video of

02:05:46
your opinion.

02:05:49
So if I look at this big result I will find some more.

02:05:53
Well I think you will find a lot of all my beautiful benefits from ownership support policies

02:05:57
in Brussels that's where this quote comes from.

02:06:00
And Madhu van Krikeen moving in out of Brussels.

02:06:07
Madhu of his work is on gentrification, but you also see that some of his papers deal with social

02:06:12
mixed and relation to gentrification specifically. So there's a lot of work.

02:06:22
And the other thing that I don't know if I'm mistaken, but I have the impression that

02:06:29
There's not actually evidence that some people actually are like you presented some arguments,

02:06:31
but they're not pretty.

02:06:34
What advice is it's already?

02:06:37
Well, I love superstitions and...

02:06:42
Well, I think that if I'm given an old paper, just why they could show me,

02:06:49
trying to find out who can be the effects and showing that there are some pieces where

02:06:56
people might benefit trust. But even then, especially for all these

02:07:01
only the two best creation of mixed neighborhood. What's quite costly?

02:07:05
Yes. What would have a few wins? Just a nice

02:07:09
structural problem. Yes, if you would use all this money to

02:07:12
a triangle not over a conflict with different.

02:07:17
And so even if it turns out social networks,

02:07:22
I think it's a good experience.

02:07:27
But yeah, so even if it turns out

02:07:32
by creating social mix you improve the situation,

02:07:36
people, aggression groups, and this, what would that be?

02:07:39
So it would try and...

02:07:46
[inaudible]

02:08:09
>> Yes, and back for five. >> Yes, and back for five. >> Yes, I think. >> The military. >> I think it's fine. >> In ruling, schools, schools, schools, schools. >> Okay. >> Thank you very much. >> Thank you very much. >> We have also planned to discuss next next. >> Yes, I think.

# 6 Cultures of urban research

00:00:29
[ Inaudible ]

00:00:37
[inaudible]

00:00:39
Welcome everyone.

00:00:42
Good evening.

00:00:46
This certainly is my favorite time of the day to teach a course.

00:00:50
At 5 p.m. time we start at 8 a.m. so anyways.

00:00:56
Welcome to our social geography or urban geography depending on your exact type of enrollment.

00:00:59
I am bus fan who often don't know me yet.

00:01:02
And I'll be here, let's say, your lecture for today's session

00:01:04
and next week's session.

00:01:07
For some reason, because I had started the web stream

00:01:10
on, but not for some reason, I received emails

00:01:13
from individual students asking for permission

00:01:15
to gain access to the panop to web stream.

00:01:19
I gave everyone access until a minute ago,

00:01:20
now I'll stop.

00:01:23
So because I have to teach at some point.

00:01:25
So if you receive, let's say messages from your fellow

00:01:28
students who cannot attend, the reason is that they arrived after five,

00:01:33
five, and it gets started. But if all goes well, the recording will be

00:01:36
recorded and uploaded, it went wrong. It appears like you today because of

00:01:42
the pan-up to technical difficulties, but hopefully will manage today. I might

00:01:47
close the window at some point, but it might help to get some oxygen in

00:01:52
here. So feel free to also open windows at the end if you refer.

00:01:56
Well, it comes with two sessions.

00:01:58
As with some other courses, we run, especially,

00:02:02
let's say the big introductory master level courses.

00:02:04
Burbing social geography, urban geography,

00:02:05
is a traumatic course.

00:02:08
So it tries to give you an insight into different, let's say,

00:02:10
teams around, let's say, concerning,

00:02:13
let's say, different takes on urban geography.

00:02:15
I would personally prefer to call this course,

00:02:19
urban theory, because I think we do more than just geography.

00:02:21
But the basic idea is to give different,

00:02:27
sexual and analytical perspectives on how to study or how we can study here.

00:02:34
My role in this course and I guess also in my own research specialty is I'm the cultural

00:02:40
guy so I tend to focus on more cultural issues so I'll be talking you through most

00:02:45
today and next week Monday to let's say cultural approaches to studying the urban.

00:02:47
Today's session, oops, here we are.

00:02:49
Today's session is really, you can see,

00:02:50
an historical overview.

00:02:54
In the sense that I want to go through some discussions

00:02:58
which you might know, or either,

00:02:59
let's say, in generic terms,

00:03:02
or rather specifically around,

00:03:04
let's see how, let's say,

00:03:06
thinking about, let's say,

00:03:08
cultural approach towards urban has been informed,

00:03:09
let's say historically speaking.

00:03:10
So we're going to go through a number

00:03:12
of, let's say, historical steps.

00:03:14
Many focusing on, let's say, the impact

00:03:18
sort of thinking about the post-modern asset. It seems like all TATs seems like all

00:03:22
information, it's certainly in the way that it's not used when this kind of

00:03:28
terminology except maybe a journalistic media but certainly not academically. As

00:03:31
been speaks for the last 10 years I wouldn't say that the post-modern has been

00:03:36
the main obsession for let's say for research but I would argue that much of

00:03:41
what has been discussed from the 1980s onwards more or less around the post-modern

00:03:46
has already is still being let's say dealt with or no using a different vocabulary.

00:03:51
This is what you would often see is that the terminology, terminology is my change,

00:03:54
but if you open, that's adapted more historical answer,

00:03:57
you will see that some of the even-doer terminologies have changed,

00:04:00
then that's the underlying or as a content,

00:04:05
the substance that behind terminology has remained the same over many, many years.

00:04:08
So not everything is new, even though you use new terminology.

00:04:10
So today's more historical session,

00:04:13
we see a historicized approach in the case.

00:04:15
Next week, it's, I mean,

00:04:17
relatively cold urban cultures,

00:04:18
but they are going to sort of give you

00:04:20
a number of perspective,

00:04:21
let's say on a relatively

00:04:23
contemporary approach towards studying

00:04:26
the urban from a culture of perspective.

00:04:30
I will not give a definition of culture.

00:04:34
I mean, I'm not, I mean, so that's a lost task.

00:04:35
It's not gonna work.

00:04:38
and I'm also not going to give a definition,

00:04:39
let's say media scholars or not

00:04:43
that have given definition on what media is still

00:04:44
going to do interesting research.

00:04:47
But please keep in mind that one of my aims here

00:04:51
is also to, if you decide to adopt a cultural approach,

00:04:53
please be very clear and specify

00:04:55
and unpacking and operationalize

00:04:56
in your use of terminology,

00:04:59
because it can mean so many different things.

00:05:00
So we have to be quite specific

00:05:03
and hopefully my lessons will help a bit

00:05:05
to give you, let's say, an insight into the different layers

00:05:09
or different, let's say, lines of research that exist

00:05:12
and it all used a terminology around culture.

00:05:13
So that's what I'm going to try,

00:05:15
let's say, to bring across two days.

00:05:20
So this is basically structure of today's session.

00:05:22
Let's see how far we get.

00:05:24
It's always unpredictable with slides

00:05:28
and then move to today and questions of students, et cetera.

00:05:30
But first I want to start with a very,

00:05:32
let's see, setting the scene,

00:05:33
focusing on the cultural turn

00:05:34
and the humanities and the social sciences.

00:05:39
I assume most of you will more or less know

00:05:40
what the cultural third in the United

00:05:43
Social Sciences is, so will not discuss this in depth.

00:05:45
There are many, many books written on this.

00:05:49
Again, it's a debate, I think that is more or less not finished,

00:05:52
but it has been, let's see, many of the debates we've had

00:05:54
when discussing the cultural third in the United

00:05:58
Social Sciences have now been internalized in everyday research.

00:06:01
So in that sense, it has become, well, naturalized

00:06:04
in very literal sense.

00:06:06
That's the first part, very much setting the seat.

00:06:09
Second part, I want to talk to you about post-modernism

00:06:11
and the city.

00:06:14
There are mainly focused on the work of Fredri Jameson,

00:06:16
not because I think that he's the only one

00:06:18
who is written on post-modernism in the city.

00:06:20
He's not even an urban scholar,

00:06:22
because he actually comes from literary studies

00:06:23
and philosophy.

00:06:25
But his work and his thinking about this

00:06:27
has been a very influential, especially

00:06:29
because it has been picked up by urban scholars

00:06:31
at a later stage.

00:06:33
Among which, the Los Angeles School of Urbanism,

00:06:38
which is the third section, the third part of today's lecture,

00:06:40
because they really have worked, you could say,

00:06:43
with this idea of the postmodern and the city,

00:06:46
and have proposed new ways of studying the city.

00:06:48
As we will see, not everything that they have proposed

00:06:51
was as new as they have claimed,

00:06:54
but still that it has been quite a foundational moment

00:06:57
for the study of the urban, for other studies at large.

00:07:01
To close, now that's closed, and there's a fourth section,

00:07:04
which adopt ups was a continuous partially

00:07:06
under what the LA School of Urbanism did,

00:07:08
but really sort of broadens it,

00:07:11
broadens it debate and has perhaps been more influential also.

00:07:14
And this is literature that's usually summarized

00:07:17
or determined all this around urban landscapes

00:07:18
or the symbolic economy.

00:07:20
And these are terms that you see popping up,

00:07:25
especially from the mid-1990s, early 2000s onwards,

00:07:27
and that is still a very influential

00:07:30
in our thinking on the city and culture today.

00:07:35
Very last part, I will discuss this today or I'll pick this up tomorrow.

00:07:41
It's what I call "Meaning Half-Way," "Hervan interpology, Cultural Studies," and "The

00:07:44
Spatial Turn," by entry point in discussing New Urban.

00:07:46
That's in the culture.

00:07:51
This is true as a spatial angiography as a discipline, whatever discipline it might be.

00:07:54
But there was a parallel debate going on.

00:07:57
What we've seen from the late 1980s, 1990s,

00:08:01
all the words is that let's say some of the concerns

00:08:03
that are in geography or economic geography,

00:08:05
or human geography at large,

00:08:08
has had really started influencing other debates

00:08:11
at the same time as human geography started engaging more

00:08:13
and let's say actively more assertively

00:08:15
with other disciplines.

00:08:17
There are many, many disciplines that could be,

00:08:19
that could be, let's say mentioned here,

00:08:21
but for me, some of the more influential ones

00:08:25
anthropology, urban anthropology and cultural studies.

00:08:29
So where geography is starting engaging more with questions around

00:08:32
and to answer questions.

00:08:36
Traditionally discussed in anthropology or in cultural studies,

00:08:39
cultural studies, anthropology is also starting engaging more with

00:08:41
the spatial concerns of geography.

00:08:44
So this is something that I will close to this,

00:08:46
lecture it or open next week lecture.

00:08:48
And I'm going to first the window.

00:08:55
[inaudible]

00:08:56
Okay.

00:09:02
I'm not sure about you. I'm curious to guys, I'm lazy here. I close the window when I don't

00:09:06
see it. I'm here in your first time.

00:09:10
I asked one reminder, I have a habit of talking fast.

00:09:14
So, if I talk too fast, just raise your hands.

00:09:20
Yeah, this is, I have the very strange habit of talking faster in English than I do in Dutch,

00:09:21
which would be my mother tongue.

00:09:23
Don't ask me why.

00:09:28
If you ask me German, I'll slow down, but that wouldn't help for, let's say, general

00:09:30
comprehension in this class, I think.

00:09:31
OK.

00:09:37
First part, cultural turn or cultural turns.

00:09:41
The slides are all uploaded, so in that sense, you don't have to sort of type like

00:09:46
It's really easy to try to focus on the main elements and try to go to flow of the argument

00:09:48
and trying to develop.

00:09:50
Some of you will notice some of you will not.

00:09:53
It really depends a bit I think on your educational backgrounds.

00:09:57
I would assume that those with the social science and especially the humanities background

00:10:01
will be more familiar with this debate than those that say coming from an engineering

00:10:06
background about it much depends a bit on the specificity also which countries you have studied.

00:10:08
So some take-home messages.

00:10:09
What is the cultural term?

00:10:16
returns, it's part of a wider shift since I would argue late 1970s, at least since this

00:10:21
period that it was phrased as such, in research practices in humanities and social sciences.

00:10:25
So there are various interrelated claims, so that's why I talk about cultural terms

00:10:31
in a way because it's not that easy to identify one single shift in research practices.

00:10:37
One is empirical, and that simply argues, well simply argues, culture is becoming

00:10:40
increasingly important in advanced societies.

00:10:43
Advanced societies being a code word for Western

00:10:45
Europe and North America basically.

00:10:47
So knowledge-based societies, advanced societies,

00:10:50
post-industrial societies, whatever term you prefer.

00:10:54
So this is the first claim being made as to why there is

00:10:56
and or should be a cultural term.

00:11:00
Culture is simply becoming more important.

00:11:02
I'll leave open a question what Dan is culture,

00:11:05
but let's just assume that it refers to the arts,

00:11:07
film media, whatever.

00:11:10
So culture becomes more important.

00:11:15
This relates to the second claim, which is theoretical.

00:11:19
We need better theories to grasp better cultural dimensions

00:11:21
of the social.

00:11:26
Referring usually to symbols of fact, meaning-making practices.

00:11:29
The one that doesn't necessarily relate to the second

00:11:31
principle you put out, no change, let's say,

00:11:33
in a beautiful phenomenon, but simply saying, well,

00:11:39
to really understand these holes for now and a better, we need theories that capture this

00:11:43
decultures, let's say dimensions of these phenomena get it.

00:11:47
But obviously when we talk about the cultural turn, often this comes together.

00:11:49
We say, okay, culture is becoming more important.

00:11:53
And very clearly, in order to really understand this better, we also need other theories

00:11:56
because the theories we have don't really capture this quite well.

00:11:58
So that's the second point.

00:12:02
The third point, again, of course, related is methodological.

00:12:05
So if this is the case or also respective of this,

00:12:09
we need new methods to better interpret empirical data

00:12:13
and/or to interpret data differently.

00:12:15
So either the old data in a different way

00:12:18
or to interpret the better or to interpret data differently.

00:12:21
So it's a time to interpret new data

00:12:23
that we need different methods for this.

00:12:25
A simple example in the current setting

00:12:28
would be if you look at the rise of social media

00:12:31
and let's say data skills, for example,

00:12:34
in that's the last 10 years, is obviously a real method

00:12:36
that also is an ought to be able to investigate

00:12:37
these phenomena.

00:12:38
So there's a classic.

00:12:41
It's a straightforward example of how new phenomena

00:12:46
has emerged as a society right, and we're not always

00:12:49
able to capture it with the same methods that we had before.

00:12:52
So you might be different skills with that methods.

00:12:55
Again, question mark, not saying this is the case,

00:12:57
but this is the idea that the argument is put forward.

00:12:59
Because obviously with the existing methods,

00:13:02
you can still do quite a lot,

00:13:03
or maybe the tweaking ones.

00:13:06
That's important to keep in mind.

00:13:06
So that's the claim,

00:13:09
but also we have to be less successful for classically,

00:13:12
because a lot of this involves less claims

00:13:15
about the cultural term does things better.

00:13:17
But that of course you always have to ask us,

00:13:19
okay, but that will compare to what?

00:13:21
And there's often a kind of simplification

00:13:22
of disciplinary histories,

00:13:25
because then we say let's say within our homography,

00:13:27
it's a, well, we need the cultural term

00:13:31
because we need more qualitative methods before all these old guys just

00:13:32
qualitative methods.

00:13:33
Yeah?

00:13:34
We're just in data crunching.

00:13:35
This is not what we need.

00:13:36
We need to do new methods.

00:13:39
And there's like, yeah, if you look superficially at that history,

00:13:41
that might be the case.

00:13:42
But if you look more closely, you

00:13:46
will see all kinds of different strands in the, I see, the 100 or more than 100

00:13:51
years of urban studies research that actually come very close to some of the claims

00:13:53
here, made here.

00:13:56
So that's the ethnographic research, for example, took place before.

00:13:59
But it's same, so it really leads to a simplification

00:14:01
of often, that's with disciplinary histories.

00:14:04
And you need to be quiet, and it's quite careful.

00:14:05
The same armaments around, let's say,

00:14:07
the industrial and the post-industrial.

00:14:08
The post-industrial is not completely new,

00:14:11
no, but attempts to let's say foreground,

00:14:13
different trends that might have existed

00:14:16
at a previous phase also, but in a last, not

00:14:17
in a sense of dominance.

00:14:21
So this is important to keep your mind.

00:14:23
Yes.

00:14:25
I don't hear anything, sorry.

00:14:27
[laughter]

00:14:29
Was your question going here?

00:14:31
[laughter]

00:14:34
I was very proud of seeing.

00:14:36
[laughter]

00:14:39
I didn't know this one, but...

00:14:41
[laughter]

00:14:45
Oh yeah, the problem was not speaking loud enough, but I'll see what I see.

00:14:49
Yeah, the building is awful, it was... the building works also, yeah, I see.

00:14:53
So yeah, I don't hear anything what you're saying, it's not just...

00:14:55
I'm just checking check check check.

00:14:59
I think we're going to bring these solar mass here.

00:15:00
It's all worked quite well.

00:15:02
The people slowly have things falling apart.

00:15:03
Here's one here, four.

00:15:05
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:08
It says also not much I can actually hear.

00:15:16
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:17
It's all in match.

00:15:19
We're going to go here and do it.

00:15:20
something.

00:15:21
Well, welcome.

00:15:26
And it's all so I'm afraid this is not working on it.

00:15:31
I'm sorry.

00:15:33
That's what you guys are going to do about it.

00:15:37
All right, I'll try to speak a bit louder and a bit slower.

00:15:39
But there's nothing I can do about the building.

00:15:41
We should be building for your solid 5-game.

00:15:42
I'll be able to watch the help.

00:15:43
Anyways.

00:15:49
[ Inaudible ]

00:15:53
>> So these are some of the main shifts that you should understand as being part

00:15:55
of, let's say, the cultural term, the cultural terms.

00:15:58
Yes? Just to give you some quick examples of, let's say,

00:16:04
of the foundational book stat that might act as a reference of,

00:16:08
let's say, exemplifying the cultural term is getting better.

00:16:09
Yeah.

00:16:13
So exemplifying the cultural turn.

00:16:15
Yes?

00:16:16
I'm wondering how people look on this.

00:16:18
I'm not sure if you don't understand anything.

00:16:19
I guess.

00:16:21
Anyways.

00:16:24
Fredic Jameson coming from literary cultural theory,

00:16:26
who I will discuss in some detail,

00:16:28
precisely because some of his elements,

00:16:30
some of his arguments are, let's say,

00:16:33
really foundational things for much of our urban studies

00:16:35
in this particular strand of research.

00:16:39
But you see it also in political science and sociality,

00:16:42
state formation after the cultural turn,

00:16:43
really looking at, you could say,

00:16:45
meaning making practices, state imaginaries,

00:16:49
some terms that maybe now have become quiet,

00:16:51
let's say, natural, really,

00:16:54
to think about what the state is,

00:16:55
but perhaps from let's say,

00:16:57
an earlier institutional point of view

00:16:59
were not so much the case.

00:17:02
And as you see, many of these claims are made.

00:17:07
cultural and economy after the cultural term.

00:17:09
Yeah.

00:17:10
It also does not help.

00:17:13
It can stand in the chair, but it really does not help the acoustics.

00:17:18
So looking at organizations much more from a cultural perspective that is not just about

00:17:22
the organization and let us see the functional matter, but also about again meeting making

00:17:31
practices, ways of behaving within organizations, anthropology and history, history and

00:17:35
sociology etc. You could name many many of these books but at that point in time

00:17:41
there was all around late 1980s throughout the 1990s the these kinds of claims

00:17:48
were made most forcefully in an academic literature. Now to Fredrik Jameson every

00:17:56
year I have to check online if he's not that yet. I don't think he's that

00:18:00
active anymore but you would think he was pretty active until five to ten

00:18:04
years ago, which in itself is quite achievement. He is published in enormous amount of books

00:18:12
and articles, is professor or emeritus professor of comparative literature at Duke University,

00:18:17
and hasn't come, I'll just put some buzzwords here, hasn't become very famous for Marxist

00:18:24
literary cultural theory, for debates obviously around modernity and postmodernity, and also for

00:18:28
the relation to culture and political economy. So even these buzzwords should already give a

00:18:30
a bit of an explanation, let's see,

00:18:32
ask him how you interpret sculpture,

00:18:34
because he has a strong, you see,

00:18:35
marks it, but in a very, less,

00:18:38
it opens matter, but especially this is important.

00:18:40
So we always look at the relation of culture

00:18:42
to political economy,

00:18:44
which is basically a code for capitalism.

00:18:46
So this is, I would say,

00:18:48
I would say is main concern in his writings

00:18:51
at least on culture and postmodernism.

00:19:04
Now, there's a phrase that has become, well, there's also his article, original published

00:19:12
in 1984, which he titled, "Postmodernism as the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism."

00:19:13
Yes?

00:19:15
So this is really, let's say, a phrase that has become very famous also.

00:19:19
You see it referred to on a regular basis.

00:19:21
Now, there are a number of elements.

00:19:23
I don't know who has read to the article.

00:19:24
I'm not going to ask.

00:19:25
I'm not even going to ask who has actually

00:19:28
managed to finish the article because it's not a simple article.

00:19:31
I'm very well aware of this.

00:19:32
It is worth it.

00:19:35
I mean, I have a drink, sit down, and you

00:19:38
mean you understand it better a bit again.

00:19:40
Who knows?

00:19:42
But it really is--

00:19:43
I'm trying to give you also, let's say,

00:19:45
some foundational original religions,

00:19:47
not just about secular literature of artists

00:19:59
writing about other artists. But this is an article related to book that is reference all the time. So it really helps to go back to the original, to get a sense of what is on you.

00:20:12
Now I picked to do your homework, I picked some as a key quotes from this article which in a way give a good summary of what this claim is about and which shaped I think some of the urban research later on.

00:20:19
First he says course, Martinism is not a style, but it is actually a cultural dominant.

00:20:21
So it is not just a lifestyle question.

00:20:25
No, it is actually something that has become dominant in our contemporary culture.

00:20:29
Second, I am directly related to aesthetic production today.

00:20:32
And this is of course where let's say it is Marxist-state political economy,

00:20:34
the sympathies show.

00:20:40
A static production today has become integrated into commodity production, generally.

00:20:46
So it's really difficult, the argues, to distinguish aesthetic production of production of the arts.

00:20:49
It's in ball, from commodities.

00:20:52
So it basically becomes one, two sides of the same coin.

00:20:54
That's basically what it is arguing.

00:20:59
I think if you start thinking and verily it's quite easy to come up with a concrete example.

00:21:01
I think that makes a lot of sense.

00:21:07
A work of art, let's say painting, is at the same time a static production.

00:21:11
It's about symbolic and reading-making practices.

00:21:15
It's about interpretation, but it also sells a yard market.

00:21:17
It's not due to speculation.

00:21:19
It's both.

00:21:21
Then I started elements.

00:21:25
I'll skip this because it's interesting about there's a very, I say, 1980 sentiment,

00:21:30
where a sort of globalization and Americanization was very much seen as one of the same thing,

00:21:35
mobilization was seen as you can see an extension of earlier history of

00:21:39
Americanization. Yeah. And then it talks about it.

00:21:42
And then again, we're not very important. I say, well, basically, it looks at post

00:21:45
modernism as a third stage of capitalism.

00:21:50
Before it was Annas Bandel was a Marxist scholar actually at this university

00:21:55
one of my years ago, which would then be, yeah, use different terminologies for

00:21:59
it. He refers to post industrial capitalism, he first debate that

00:22:08
of the multinational capital and the consumer capitalism. So you can argue this all here is politically

00:22:15
economically, politically, economically sized, are postmodernism. So postmodernism accompanies

00:22:22
this phase of capitalism. That also means according to Jameson, it only makes sense to talk

00:22:29
about postmodernism from let's say the mid-1970s onwards. There is no such thing, in this way of

00:22:33
reasoning as postmodernism in the 1920s just doesn't make any sense.

00:22:38
Yeah? Because it's so much tied to a particular phase or a particular stage of capitality.

00:22:45
One reason why this article has become quite famous and it's a bit more difficult to understand

00:22:51
now I think is because it does quite an extensive reading and interpretation of one particular

00:22:56
So we're telling, we're just a bonnetman to hotel in Los Angeles.

00:23:02
So designed by John Portman built in the mid 1970s and one of the largest hotels in LA

00:23:05
and to my knowledge, it still is.

00:23:09
So just some pictures.

00:23:14
This hotel for him, it's a bit hard to imagine now, but if you look, represents, you

00:23:20
could say, the culmination of postmodernism as the late logic, as the last logic of late

00:23:21
capitalism.

00:23:24
So what does the argue here?

00:23:26
You will see some of these elements return

00:23:29
and later the base without reference to the hotel

00:23:31
or the specificity of his argument.

00:23:35
It ispires to be a total space, a complete world,

00:23:37
and attempt to not be a part of the city.

00:23:39
So it attempts to be a world on its own.

00:23:43
You may not be a part of the city,

00:23:46
so that the reflector class here, which rebels to see,

00:23:50
outside and achieves a peculiar and placeless.

00:23:55
disassociation of the Bonavantura from its neighborhoods.

00:23:57
Just keep this in mind, some of these altitudes,

00:23:58
because they will return later.

00:24:00
The other, the separate from the city.

00:24:02
So it's quite easy to imagine later,

00:24:04
and I'll give some examples also,

00:24:05
if you think of, let's say,

00:24:06
gain the community-style things, right?

00:24:09
Things that are, let's say, within the city,

00:24:10
but cities are highly unequal.

00:24:12
So you have different elements, let's say,

00:24:14
separate, even though they're formally speaking part

00:24:15
of the city.

00:24:16
This is what he's arguing at,

00:24:19
that this is what we see in the Bonavantura Hotel.

00:24:22
And this becomes a bit more difficult to imagine now,

00:24:25
because it really is, I think, an experience of that time.

00:24:28
I think we now so used to these kinds of architectures

00:24:29
and these kinds of buildings.

00:24:32
But according to them, this becomes impossible to navigate.

00:24:34
Of course, not in a high-risk space,

00:24:37
a lot of our lives skip that, is impossible to navigate.

00:24:39
It's just too confusing in many ways.

00:24:43
You can no longer situate yourself as a subject

00:24:45
within this world, but you're just very,

00:24:47
a very fragmented human being.

00:24:48
That was a kind of, let's say,

00:24:53
It's typical, let's say, literary trope of 1980s postmodernism.

00:24:57
I think this has probably become less central to the debate,

00:24:59
most likely because we have so--

00:25:03
we have become so used to behaving like this in the world.

00:25:13
Again, I want to discuss these details.

00:25:14
I'll skip the first.

00:25:16
This one might be important to remember here,

00:25:18
because again, this shows up and later discussions,

00:25:20
especially when we think about discussions

00:25:21
around cultural heritage.

00:25:22
Yeah.

00:25:26
His story is a space of history, a random cannibalization

00:25:27
of all the styles of the past.

00:25:31
And his idea that especially postmodern architecture

00:25:34
just used different elements for different eras

00:25:36
and combined as into new building.

00:25:39
So it didn't produce, let's say, formally speaking,

00:25:41
something new, but it was more of a reco-lage

00:25:46
combination of all kinds of existing, let's say, architectural styles.

00:25:49
That's a random categorization of the style of the past.

00:25:52
The past has a reference of drag and re-bracketed

00:25:56
reading with nothing but texts.

00:25:59
So this is also, again, something that pops up

00:26:05
in later discussions on what does the culture actually

00:26:06
produce?

00:26:08
And then there's this idea that the post model that-- well,

00:26:10
you actually read the post model phase,

00:26:17
but there's no linear trajectory if there ever was a say between history and futures just recycling of the past.

00:26:32
Okay, now that's Jamesson does that make a bit more sense than what you read the text?

00:26:35
Yeah

00:26:37
okay

00:26:44
Now I mentioned Jameson not because I like my old almost dead white men

00:26:51
But because he really has been inspirational saying for many let's say researchers that came after from different different perspectives also

00:26:55
Yeah, the Mars engine of school of hermies was born with last cities

00:27:01
Let's say cluster or like cluster of activity that came together from the mid-night

00:27:04
It's all worth and we also refer to Jameson

00:27:05
I know she's built on it anymore.

00:27:11
You can see social scientific urban research type of map.

00:27:13
What does the law of science school of urbanism

00:27:13
argue?

00:27:15
I don't think she's struck this idea

00:27:19
that it is a queer and school, but that it's said to argue.

00:27:22
First of all, following Jameson, literally following Jameson,

00:27:24
it looks at the postmodern condition

00:27:27
as a radically new urban condition.

00:27:31
So this is what they call postmodern urbanism.

00:27:33
Main characteristics, again, be aware

00:27:37
Let's say the simplification of disciplinary histories,

00:27:39
because it does have, especially in this,

00:27:42
let's say foundational texts or texts that

00:27:45
try to say really puts, let's say,

00:27:46
the LA school of early on the map

00:27:49
through a number of key publications.

00:27:50
It did have a tendency to then say,

00:27:52
okay, but everything that came before,

00:27:54
in a way it was, it's old hat.

00:27:55
We don't want that.

00:27:57
We need something new.

00:27:59
So again, very, very much a strong sense

00:28:02
of simplification for some of the main characteristics,

00:28:04
itself, itself, and fun.

00:28:08
Beyond Chikawa School, what we see now is not to

00:28:11
see a centric city, but know it's about urban

00:28:11
fragmentation.

00:28:13
Yeah.

00:28:16
It understands LA and Southern California as

00:28:17
privileged cases.

00:28:20
So the priority case for the research, but also as a

00:28:24
prototypical case, in the sense that the understood LA and

00:28:28
Southern California as the future of other cities across

00:28:29
the world.

00:28:32
Look at what we see happening in LA and this region.

00:28:34
This is what we will see happening in cities across the world.

00:28:38
Yes, so it's kind of pre-figures as the future urban developments.

00:28:40
Yeah?

00:28:43
It made a lot of attention to restructuring,

00:28:45
which was like, say, the generic word,

00:28:47
focusing mostly on post-fourdism,

00:28:51
flexible accumulation, the redeveloped of firms.

00:28:57
So we won't go into this because I think you're all aware by now of, let's see, let's see.

00:28:59
Yeah, post-fourdism, basically.

00:29:01
Yeah?

00:29:03
And there's a nice quote from my Davis,

00:29:05
"Riner and Liverpool Riner"

00:29:09
belonging more elastic to the same scene in a way

00:29:12
where we talked about the LA School of Urbanists saying,

00:29:14
well, they're basically politically economists

00:29:15
with their spacesuits on.

00:29:17
Quite sure the food you understand, what he means it,

00:29:21
but it sounds really nice as a quote.

00:29:23
So here's your sense, it's politically economy,

00:29:25
but it's a bit off, it's something else, right?

00:29:27
It's a bit speculative.

00:29:41
Now, I already said it's important again to be aware of simplification of disciplinary

00:29:45
histories and it also applies to the LA school as such.

00:29:51
So it was seen as a coherent school, but it was also soon critiqued by others.

00:29:56
And even by those within working within this domain, or that was said, I say, label that's

00:30:00
been part of the LA School of Urbanism saying, well, actually, there's not one single

00:30:03
claim being made by the LA School of Urbanism.

00:30:07
But actually, there's more diversity within this supposed school.

00:30:15
So there is a diversity within Cohe

00:30:19
in itself of all the histories, longer histories, but it really came to gather at this

00:30:20
point in time.

00:30:25
And I think it still shapes, to some extent, to quite the substantial extent you

00:30:27
current research that we are doing today.

00:30:35
So one important strand to absolute shares become even the most famous one is for political

00:30:39
economy, economic geography, I guess. It really looks at post-war and

00:30:43
complex accumulation, industrial organization, regional development.

00:30:48
So really about the transformation of firms, how firms relate to each other, how they connect,

00:30:51
And what this means for regional development?

00:30:53
The Latinx and the key artist,

00:30:55
they have to mention that perhaps how it starts,

00:30:56
the Christoph

00:30:57
or certain Michael's store,

00:31:00
but most of you will have heard of these names at least.

00:31:03
I heard there was other lines of work.

00:31:04
One thing we would be this probably is

00:31:06
to some extent most relate to the first

00:31:08
and politically calling your place,

00:31:10
because if you look at, let's say,

00:31:12
regional development, the transformation of companies,

00:31:14
there's also an element there.

00:31:16
What does this mean, actually,

00:31:19
local place conditions, a place identity,

00:31:21
but it also has to do with branding elements,

00:31:23
it has to do with, let's say,

00:31:26
local patriotism, or it has to do with local labor markets,

00:31:28
et cetera, yeah?

00:31:29
Yes, that leads to this,

00:31:31
the strand I mean, they're all related obviously.

00:31:33
So what I Jennifer Rolf have been worked

00:31:36
on homelessness, on skilled work, local labor markets,

00:31:38
the classic argument in this literature

00:31:41
is that the transformation of the region,

00:31:43
as a result of less of a transformation

00:31:44
of its political economy,

00:31:47
leads to more polarized labor markets.

00:31:51
So we have, let's say, put in a simplified sense.

00:31:53
We have, let's say, higher earners,

00:31:55
and we have, let's say, very let's see,

00:31:58
if not unskilled, and then it can very low pay

00:32:01
and precariously employ it workers on the bottom.

00:32:04
So it leads to a more polarized labor market.

00:32:06
There's also the argument that has been picked up later

00:32:09
by someone like SARS-CAS-SUSPEN, working on global C's.

00:32:11
So that's important.

00:32:13
And this wraps us, let's, let's,

00:32:18
that's famous but what's emerging now I think more forward force for the last 10 years

00:32:22
is work around environmental justice you know the transformation of the region has also had

00:32:28
effects on the environment at large planning issues but also ecology issues were narrowly

00:32:32
put and this has already received some attention there yes.

00:32:40
He said to say on the space of the kind of march to not that everyone would end up like a

00:32:49
name without any of the things that might have happened to the things.

00:32:50
I'll give some examples.

00:32:52
I'll take later on.

00:32:54
But basically it's about overfactantation.

00:33:00
We would have to put it in a bus word to this idea that, I mean, especially me, for

00:33:02
So those that are attending my lecture on the European series,

00:33:04
there's this idea that it's a compact city,

00:33:07
there's a coherent city, it's historically grown,

00:33:09
and then there's a lot of actually,

00:33:11
it's opposed to modern city, it's almost inverse, right?

00:33:14
It's just like a chess board where whatever you could put

00:33:15
for, actually, not a good example,

00:33:17
because you don't say, "If I have tier rules there."

00:33:20
But, but you just like a game board where you could put

00:33:23
wherever you want, and this is how the city develops.

00:33:25
Yeah? So, and this is what, and so this relates

00:33:27
to urban fragmentation, and the other one's broad,

00:33:29
I would say.

00:33:31
There must be two issues where they argue, okay,

00:33:34
this is actually foreshadowing why the Roman develops.

00:33:36
And they're not completely wrong, of course.

00:33:39
I would simply, I would just argue that maybe LA

00:33:41
was not the first and in parallel of these

00:33:43
to be solved and see many other cities,

00:33:44
where this was also the case,

00:33:46
especially in the global south.

00:33:50
But this is, I mean, that's only a critique

00:33:53
that has been raised towards the LA school also,

00:33:56
because it's only, only on a later stage,

00:33:57
I think, that it started looking outside

00:33:58
as North America.

00:34:03
You said it started, it was from American buyers, maybe West and Europe, and totally

00:34:04
later they started spanning.

00:34:10
And then of course somebody's theories no longer hold or somebody claves in any case.

00:34:11
Yeah?

00:34:12
Yeah.

00:34:16
So there's a lot of diversity.

00:34:21
If you look at it at the same time it must be set, purely, to flee between the mid-1980s

00:34:27
and the late-1990s, various key publications were published that put LA really on the

00:34:34
map of urban studies. So this really helps to think to retrospectively look at this as a kind of

00:34:41
current LA school of urbanism. Yeah, ranging from 1986 special issue in society and space which

00:34:47
is one of the key journals specifically dedicated to LA to books like the city Los Angeles

00:34:55
Urban Theory in the mid-1990s or rethinking LA or studies by Alan Jay Scott on Technopolis. There

00:34:57
many, many of these key books that really appeared

00:35:00
that are key references in the field of our studies

00:35:05
that are still a dealt with or referred to today.

00:35:07
For example, Mike, Mike Davis, and I've

00:35:11
said a lot of academic per se, but his famous book

00:35:15
City of Quartz, which again, is continuously referenced

00:35:20
in many different parts of your studies world and beyond.

00:35:34
This one is perhaps already a partial answer to your question because this shows a bit in a three, I would say, how some of these artists looked at at city development.

00:35:42
I would say in extreme because this is really an article that tries to codify some of the claims of a rate of more subtle manner, but many other orders.

00:35:47
And by doing so, they also radicalize some of these claims.

00:35:53
Not necessarily enough in an helpful manner, I think, but it helps to keep in mind.

00:35:56
So they said they argued that the spatial manifestation,

00:35:59
so maybe all the deer and flusties sort of forgot their names.

00:36:06
They argued that the spatial manifestation of postmodern urbanism was a kind of keynote capitalism.

00:36:08
So basically, it's apparently a board game.

00:36:12
I wasn't aware of that, but basically a very fragmented form of an

00:36:18
infrastructure in which the code in urbanization is occurring on a quasi random

00:36:23
field of opportunities. So basically there is no longer this idea that you have a

00:36:27
city center that it emerges outwards or that particular structures related to

00:36:33
planning or set or not it just it's pretty random. And this also of course

00:36:36
also the end of theory because if you make this kind of flame that does not

00:36:42
really much you can, you can do anymore. So it's also highly that's simplified. So I would

00:36:46
certainly not encourage you to understand this as the core business of the early school of urbanism.

00:36:54
This is almost more a parody of this. Nevertheless, some of the last, the items, literally speaking,

00:37:01
they put on the map of key on capitalism still resonate with us today. Because for example,

00:37:06
We appear at no birth, which you could say there's a lot of reaches still going on unless the ethnic

00:37:11
communities, relation between ethnic groups and, let's say, localities within these neighborhoods.

00:37:16
We have team marks, far side, a lot of commodity commodification of public space.

00:37:18
We have community communities without losing place role.

00:37:24
We have street war affairs, obviously there's violence in the city, which is a classic team in our research.

00:37:28
Spectacle, again, which relates to the commodification of space.

00:37:32
Commanding control centers, which is, let's say, a classic team of

00:37:35
like SaaSka SaaS centers, I did at Global Cities,

00:37:39
it's already actually happens when it comes to both political and economic rule.

00:37:44
So, all these different elements do, well, we're identified by them,

00:37:49
and have played the portal role in later research on the city.

00:37:58
I guess some examples already here. I don't need to go through this idea.

00:38:09
So much my summary of the LA school of realism. I already hinted at the fact that this was not without its critique.

00:38:17
Some of this critique was quite legitimate because one of, let's say, my hobby or is this really more against the simplification of disciplinary histories.

00:38:20
There's a lot of academic laziness involved.

00:38:22
You want to make it claim that you do something

00:38:23
rather than an interesting.

00:38:25
And by doing that, you say, but that

00:38:27
what came before was actually not an interesting,

00:38:30
but you actually simplify that history.

00:38:32
So if you're intellectually, I think, very honest,

00:38:35
you have to be very careful with these kinds of strategies.

00:38:37
You have to be much more, as the honest and open

00:38:39
and respectful also of what came before.

00:38:42
And maybe moderate your own claims towards newness.

00:38:44
This is not what the LA school did.

00:38:44
All right, so that's it.

00:38:45
Some more.

00:38:51
So critics were also abundance and very early on,

00:38:54
raised, let's say, made, let's say,

00:38:57
problems, had the delicious thing had,

00:38:58
raised, let's say, the claims of newness

00:39:01
put forward by LA's good audience.

00:39:03
One being, what's really new here?

00:39:04
Yeah?

00:39:06
You might claim that this is where

00:39:08
it doesn't receive enough attention,

00:39:10
but actually there's already a lot of existing work

00:39:13
on diversity, restructuring, consumption,

00:39:15
into modification or in every poverty.

00:39:19
And especially every poverty has been foundational to

00:39:22
riding on the urban since the mid-19th century.

00:39:25
So there's vaccines industrialization basically.

00:39:26
So what's really new here?

00:39:29
That's the first legitimate criticism.

00:39:34
Second one is the LA school,

00:39:37
it really sort of reduced Duchikago school

00:39:40
to account of Bergus, concentric zone model.

00:39:43
that everything that was written in the 1930s,

00:39:47
which is post-hocks sometimes labeled as the Chicago School,

00:39:50
was about the consent of the solar model.

00:39:52
It's the idea that there's a central,

00:39:54
a business district and that people move outward,

00:39:58
depending on the history and capital also.

00:39:59
Yeah?

00:40:01
There's much more internal of our work,

00:40:03
or there was much more internal horizon

00:40:04
within the Chicago School,

00:40:07
so it does not justify this kind of simplification.

00:40:10
So many of the things that the LA School is now doing,

00:40:13
actually was already happening in the Chicago school.

00:40:15
So let's say the American claim,

00:40:16
there's of course also a struggle you could say

00:40:18
within LA, within the US,

00:40:21
but I can say, well, we've had Chicago

00:40:22
now we move to LA.

00:40:24
This is where the action is happening.

00:40:25
And then many other odds were saying,

00:40:27
well, maybe not quite.

00:40:28
Yeah?

00:40:30
So that's the board key mind.

00:40:32
A third one, this graph from me,

00:40:35
the most interesting or the most relevant critique

00:40:38
is there is truly, I think,

00:40:43
kind of ethnographic voids in a lot of literature and postmodern urbanism. What do I mean by this?

00:40:50
It really relies on a kind of detached reading of the city. This is the most, let's say extreme example.

00:40:55
This is how we see the city. I mean after his anything more top-down than this, I mean it's hard to

00:41:00
imagine, right? It really is like okay, let's see here. This is how we see the city. But in a no-ways

00:41:06
at no stage, do you see any engagement with what people on the ground actually think about the city

00:41:11
the delivered or worked in. So it's a very sort of top-down matrix-oriented

00:41:16
reading of the city, which is labeled as an ethnographic void, which I think

00:41:21
is the most forceful treaty. There's a marginalized agency and

00:41:27
interpretation of ordinary people. And there's no postmodernism from below.

00:41:31
You could imagine a kind of, I say, fragmented urbanism and the

00:41:36
the political lodge of combination of elements by people making, making do, making a living

00:41:38
in the city and combining different elements.

00:41:41
But none of that is part of this discussion.

00:41:47
And so it's much more, much too doubt down, too detached reading.

00:41:52
Last critique, and this I have to relate a bit to this idea that LA pre-figures wider

00:41:53
urban developments.

00:41:57
They're saying, well, LA is actually not that much of a difference.

00:42:04
two levels. First, within LA, existing urban theories before the LA School of Urbanism

00:42:12
are still relevant to explain what happens in LA. LA is not a complete free, let's say,

00:42:18
boards with quasi-random, let's say, attempt to stay in place. Now you can use all the theories

00:42:23
around, let's say, agglomeration, for example, in order to understand LA or in this wider region,

00:42:24
So that's one thing.

00:42:27
The other side is that the group of phenomena

00:42:31
you see in our area are also visible elsewhere.

00:42:33
And not just as a pre-figuring or something

00:42:35
that comes after the other school,

00:42:37
urbanists talked about our aid.

00:42:39
No, it actually something that was already before.

00:42:41
Maybe some cities were even earlier.

00:42:43
And this I think is also to some extent

00:42:46
where especially research work in the global science

00:42:49
really connected to, let's say, okay,

00:42:52
that's much happening elsewhere,

00:42:58
which is perhaps more interesting also and certainly shows let's say that LA is not that special after all

00:43:03
Okay

00:43:06
Wow

00:43:10
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:12
>> Yeah, that's a screen because otherwise there's a lot of ears.

00:43:16
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:45
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:03
I would say to me that I would say certain strands within geography this is what you see. But if you look at much of this literature, especially work by people like Alan Scott who's in the stop us and they are all working in the kind of realist vein.

00:44:07
right, in the sense of it's pretty straightforward and favorable research.

00:44:10
There's a world out there that's going to study it.

00:44:14
Some of the examples you mentioned might have happened, but I would say that was more, let's

00:44:17
say, visible or more central to the data in literary studies.

00:44:21
Maybe cultural studies, to some extent, and less so in geography.

00:44:27
So I don't think it was necessarily when it came to the other school of urbanism, necessary

00:44:32
much reflection actually on the epistemologically, the pathological dimension, and it

00:44:35
There was more an observation of new empirical facts

00:44:38
on the ground, which necessitated new theories.

00:44:39
I'll call it them.

00:44:41
So I think it's more on that method.

00:44:43
But obviously, as I said, to very good,

00:44:45
there is no such thing as one culture term.

00:44:48
And also no such thing as one post-modernism.

00:44:51
So I think that's-- and if you look at the way in terms

00:44:55
such as the post-modern has been, I say,

00:44:57
discussed with the different disciplines,

00:45:00
you see quite radical differences between what

00:45:03
actually understood by the postmodern in the first place.

00:45:07
They're interesting books written on this also, but yeah.

00:45:11
Okay. Other questions on these first?

00:45:15
Three, was it two more substantial bars?

00:45:22
No. How are we doing time bars?

00:45:26
Yeah, let's give it a few more minutes then we'll see.

00:45:29
Am I talking too fast or is it okay-ish?

00:45:32
I think the fact that it has to be very loud,

00:45:33
it automatically slows me down.

00:45:35
So that helps, no worries.

00:45:37
So I might just start screaming in my lectures

00:45:40
and that I'll slow down my temple.

00:45:41
Yeah.

00:45:46
OK.

00:45:52
So we've got cultural turn.

00:45:55
We've got postmodern, let's say, James Solyan

00:46:02
approach it and then sort of vision on the postmodern. This indirectly or directly influence

00:46:06
a lot of LA school urbanism work. Yeah I think it was not just Jamesson but there are many

00:46:10
of many of us similarities there and there's a related strand which now I want to discuss

00:46:16
with you which I would call as Erwin Landscape and the Civil War of the economy mostly because

00:46:20
this is the terminology that was I mean the difference strands of research but there's a lot of

00:46:27
research around these discounted teams which supposedly refer to actual facts on the ground.

00:46:30
So don't see that something really different from the

00:46:34
Yale School of Urbanists is more let's say developing in parallel.

00:46:38
Perhaps also with different inspirations coming up with a bit more I would argue from

00:46:41
Leslie Culture Studies tradition which also emerged in the 1980s.

00:46:44
Yeah but obviously there are interactions also so just

00:46:46
you know as a clear catch category we'll see it.

00:46:54
If you look at what I now describe as, let's say, one body of literature because for me it makes sense to describe this as a relative

00:47:01
appearance body of literature. There are a number of key guiding assumptions, arguments shaping this kind of literature.

00:47:09
One very similar to Jameson, flexible accumulation, post-fourdism and post-modernism are two sides of the same coin.

00:47:13
So this is your Marxist argument, right? So there's a political economy and the culture is

00:47:20
the supersetive, the other side of this one of the bleecon. But it's impossible to extract.

00:47:27
It just belongs very close to together. And innovation perhaps that this literature introduces,

00:47:36
according to the much of this literature, says, well, we receive the rise of postmodernism also hanging together with the rise of a new middle class.

00:47:42
And this very much hangs together again with just a rise of post-foughtism, post-industrialism,

00:47:48
because it led to new, you could say, work opportunities, new fields of work, new labor markets,

00:47:56
which demand that you could say a type of worker, a type of population that was overall highly educated,

00:48:01
that was knowledge oriented, yes, this is the kind of debate around higher education,

00:48:05
knowledge-based capitalism, and this was very much seen as it's highly educated,

00:48:07
that this is what they should understood

00:48:10
to be the rise of a new middle class.

00:48:12
It's not your class of middle class,

00:48:13
which perhaps may say more fixed,

00:48:16
but in this sense, the introduction that was done here,

00:48:19
say, okay, this rise of the new middle class,

00:48:23
is accompanied by a rise or an interest

00:48:25
in new university aesthetic sensibilities,

00:48:28
sensitivity, interest, preferences.

00:48:32
This idea that there's a new kind of a static emerging

00:48:34
with this new group of people.

00:48:36
recently labeled and commodity aesthetics in a way

00:48:38
that because it was highly driven,

00:48:41
a variety related to let's see lifestyle references.

00:48:42
Yeah?

00:48:43
So I'm interested.

00:48:46
I'm interested in a little bit of an example.

00:48:46
I'm interested.

00:48:49
I work for, let's say, a--

00:48:51
not, I can't talk about the good example.

00:48:53
I'll try to come up with a better example here.

00:48:55
I'll give you an example in a minute.

00:48:56
Yes, so it does really matter.

00:49:03
Look, as the kind of examples I was thinking about,

00:49:05
I'm mostly around, let's say, urban street culture, for example,

00:49:09
which is very much related to particular lifestyle

00:49:12
that really lead to how you identify

00:49:13
with particular lifestyle.

00:49:16
These lifestyle are close to connected to the buying

00:49:18
and showing off particular commodities.

00:49:23
Shoes, clothes, hard work that you associate with it,

00:49:26
a bit higher up, et cetera.

00:49:27
So let's say the second part.

00:49:32
Third one is that culture was key or is key to urban redevelopment.

00:49:34
This has remained, I think, very influential.

00:49:35
I'm doing work on this still.

00:49:38
But there's also this work that was already,

00:49:39
let's say, put forward at the start

00:49:42
being done in the late 1980s.

00:49:44
We've been done on real estate, on artists,

00:49:47
on recresentations of urban space.

00:49:51
If you think now, we've been done on the impact

00:49:54
of gentrification, on city spaces.

00:49:57
How artists play a role in both, let's say,

00:50:00
boosting gentrification, but also being kicked out

00:50:01
of gentifying areas.

00:50:05
That's a classic argument which I was zucan already made in the early,

00:50:07
no, in the mid-9080s.

00:50:11
So not much has changed to the same in that respect.

00:50:13
And the fourth role I think this is something

00:50:15
that was well to begin with, also picked up

00:50:17
more in the European side of discussion,

00:50:21
and which was not really at all really picked up

00:50:24
by the Yali School of Urbanism, is an important role

00:50:28
of the state, staying investing in cultural landmarks,

00:50:31
but also really developing all kinds of cultural economic

00:50:32
policies.

00:50:35
So this is more or less, if we have to give, let's say,

00:50:39
a nutshell definition or a listing of key elements,

00:50:42
what the symbolic economy literature is more or less about.

00:50:48
Few examples.

00:50:50
One interesting article that we have

00:50:54
in the rest of this urban landscape, early 1990s,

00:50:57
where we argue very much along James Sonian lives,

00:50:59
there's widespread agreements that

00:51:06
what emergence of postmodern architecture, culture and philosophy in Western society has

00:51:12
proceeded in tandem with the emergence of globalized more flexible forms of capitalist

00:51:13
enterprise.

00:51:19
For a second part of that quote, postmodernism as the cultural closing of advanced capitalism.

00:51:25
So this is basically James of all over the two sides of the same quote.

00:51:31
I registered a question here because I would question if there was really that kind of widespread agreement.

00:51:37
Yes, there was widespread agreement on this claim within Marx's political economy.

00:51:43
And yes, Marx in political economy became, let's say, especially with geography,

00:51:48
it's pretty not dominant, but central to the debates, I would say, in the 1980s and '99s,

00:51:54
especially in the early '90s and '90s. And this is part of that explanatory logic.

00:52:00
I personally am seeing much to agree with and these kinds of claims by acknowledging actually

00:52:06
that that message cultural expressions are always that easily the other side of the same coin

00:52:12
of the capitalist politically company. So there's more complexity there that is easily

00:52:19
let's say simplified. So this is important to keep in mind unless of course your food

00:52:21
the agreement design, which is possible.

00:52:37
So the point about the rise of a new middle class,

00:52:39
again, in the same article, Box Office

00:52:42
is a crime used for some real crime.

00:52:43
You know, it makes a couple of claims, which

00:52:46
is not specific to Nox, but I think

00:52:49
specific or represent of La Cides wider literature.

00:52:51
First he says, well, and this is the shift

00:52:54
to post-industrialism, the emergence of new class

00:52:57
fractions under advanced capitalism.

00:53:01
So we see dominant classes, but actually change over time.

00:53:04
But so the structure is speaking, I say this hierarchy

00:53:06
remains, but different class fractions

00:53:08
might emerge to become dominant.

00:53:10
This is what now under advanced capitalism,

00:53:12
we've seen the words of new class fractions

00:53:16
or a new middle class under advanced capitalism.

00:53:18
That's the economic argument.

00:53:21
The cultural argument would be this was also

00:53:25
a generalical reaction against modernist aesthetics.

00:53:28
I say, the children growing up in the 1960s

00:53:30
rebelled against their modernist parents

00:53:32
and thus started supporting different ways

00:53:35
of behavior, different ways of cultural preferences.

00:53:38
It's not wrong, it's highly simplified,

00:53:39
but it's not wrong, of course.

00:53:43
So that's the perceived, the socio-cultural audience.

00:53:44
Right?

00:53:47
To this related then, let's say this move away,

00:53:49
this critique of modernism,

00:53:53
really refer more to the kind of lifestyle orientation,

00:53:55
which you can look at positively,

00:53:57
or become a part of everyday life.

00:53:59
This is something that's not just something

00:54:00
that is separate from us.

00:54:02
No, it becomes even more radical.

00:54:04
But you can also look at it more critically,

00:54:06
or just become an out of commodity.

00:54:07
It's just a question of lifestyle,

00:54:10
show your identity, showing off your identity.

00:54:12
So there's a lifestyle orientation.

00:54:15
Self-realization expression, and I

00:54:17
need phrase-phosphology, cultural politics,

00:54:20
true sort of culture, you position yourself

00:54:22
as a citizen in many ways.

00:54:26
We're looking at the imagination that already

00:54:29
into the act of described commodity aesthetics,

00:54:31
a kind of niche oriented consumption

00:54:33
with emphasis on taste and aesthetics,

00:54:35
and hence an increased role for design also.

00:54:38
someone I call a mouse, and they never work,

00:54:40
they specifically focus on urban design,

00:54:45
or design sector as a central sector

00:54:46
in advanced capitalism.

00:54:49
And we can all understand how this works.

00:54:53
I mean, I think we're all parts in a way of this group, right?

00:54:56
So I wear this closing, but not that close.

00:54:57
We can do it exactly the same,

00:55:00
but just a slightly different color, right?

00:55:01
I wear these shoes, but not these shoes,

00:55:05
or I want wooden floors, or not these kinds of floors,

00:55:10
in my house depending on which phase in your life, your life you are.

00:55:14
It's pretty niche but still we have very strong opinions about this.

00:55:15
Don't start talking to me about music.

00:55:18
They have very strong opinions about music.

00:55:23
But if I look at it from a more distance, obviously I have to admit that it's pretty niche.

00:55:30
Yes, so now I sort of, let's see, I established distinctions between what is good,

00:55:32
bad or bad or not good.

00:55:34
Yeah, it's pretty specific.

00:55:36
So I think this is important,

00:55:38
this is really about this initial area consumption.

00:55:42
That has increased, I think, rapidly over the last 30 years.

00:55:44
I think this is not something that we saw

00:55:48
to such an extent if you would go to the 1980s,

00:55:50
for example, early 1980s.

00:55:57
Culture and urban redevelopment, for another strand,

00:56:00
I would say that's really part of this kind of debate.

00:56:04
Even earlier in need, I forgot that it's this early.

00:56:06
One of the earliest probably the first book actually

00:56:09
by Sharon Zuken, who's called "Loth Living."

00:56:11
I guess most of you would also know Sharon Zuken

00:56:14
was done a lot of work in cultural and city.

00:56:18
"Loth Living" was already published in 1982.

00:56:21
She was early for her time, so it's not,

00:56:23
you could say not that typical, but it was really

00:56:25
a foundational book, I think.

00:56:27
And it really shapes still many of the dates

00:56:29
that we're having today around the role of artists,

00:56:32
in particular in urban settings.

00:56:36
So around law of living, which was New York oriented, and there are laughs in New York,

00:56:40
but there are laughs in New York, which of course does not apply to every city, but

00:56:45
structure is sleeping. You can see similar processes, at least in larger cities, I would say.

00:56:51
What did she argue? Okay, we have let's say abandoned laughs, empty laughs, and we see a

00:56:56
re-arpegency of abandoned structures by artists. So early 1980s we're talking about here.

00:57:01
Also New York at the height you could see of its crisis, and let's say at the deep end of this

00:57:02
developed.

00:57:04
But it's the first thing.

00:57:06
A re-occupancy of abandoned structures, where ours.

00:57:09
This is not followed by a new middle class.

00:57:13
Yeah, so the artist move in first is still rough for a rowdy, but then the new middle

00:57:17
class moves in and it gets a bit more, a bit more, a bit more, a sea clean, a bit more

00:57:23
fancy, which she calls a reconquest of the inner city, needing to kind of laugh lifestyle.

00:57:30
There are people living in, let's say, dwellings that do not represent your class fill

00:57:34
that point in time, sub-berber, let's say one family household.

00:57:37
So you have to come up with a new architectural style,

00:57:41
a new way of imagining how to live in these laws.

00:57:44
Besides an also become an increasing trade of conflict

00:57:46
between competing uses.

00:57:48
Those between alt and havences, if the inhabitants,

00:57:52
if they were still there, artists, and a new real-world class.

00:57:55
Where artists use laws also as a production infrastructure

00:57:57
to produce art.

00:58:00
you will have last by and large used these laws

00:58:01
as residential infrastructure.

00:58:03
Yeah, we worked somewhere else.

00:58:07
And then culture is also very early on,

00:58:09
especially even from the early nights,

00:58:12
the age onwards in New York was used to develop

00:58:15
and profit from an emergent real estate market.

00:58:18
So real estate intermediaries, very early on,

00:58:21
realized that our desardest movie in,

00:58:23
selling this area becomes interesting,

00:58:26
becomes visible at the very least.

00:58:28
And thus we can actually use this.

00:58:29
We can explore this.

00:58:30
This is something we can build on.

00:58:32
And we can start identifying this.

00:58:36
We can start selling this for a project.

00:58:37
Now this was early '98.

00:58:40
And if I tell you with this story, it's pretty clear,

00:58:43
I would think, being all being over scholars,

00:58:47
that this resonates, let's put it at those terms,

00:58:50
resonates with discussions you see on an everyday level

00:58:52
and most of the cities that you are familiar with.

00:58:55
This idea that, oh, that's a gentifying area,

00:59:00
this like a proto defvenation of gentrification or cultural gentrification.

00:59:07
So I think if I think of an area such as anyone Brussels such as Saint-Gio to some extent this

00:59:14
logic is followed. I mean I'm not familiar with too many cities but I see several things happening

00:59:19
in Berlin or so on and still see happenings and saw happening and in many other cities where this

00:59:21
is the case, quite obviously.

00:59:24
For this, has been a major strand of research

00:59:26
for quite a long time already.

00:59:28
And it has been refined, et cetera,

00:59:30
but it still shapes the discussion.

00:59:43
So ultimately, of course, there's also, again,

00:59:45
this has also received research adventure.

00:59:46
But also, the main set art is

00:59:49
have become both drivers and victims of urban development.

00:59:54
And similarly, in that time, ours are in development,

00:59:57
which shows our artists were, well, really,

01:00:01
the early, let's say, the movers to move into a certain area

01:00:03
and start developing the area,

01:00:05
to build into development, to love development,

01:00:07
other types of building development.

01:00:11
But then, when the area, the neighborhood

01:00:13
had reached a certain stage of development

01:00:16
and real estate prices, ours then, again,

01:00:20
were in a sense moved out because they could no longer afford to live there.

01:00:24
Except those perhaps that were smart enough to buy at an early stage, but this was rarely

01:00:25
the case.

01:00:26
But then the end.

01:00:29
So they were both drivers and victims of urban change.

01:00:33
And this again hasn't changed that much over the last 30 years.

01:00:39
Except that perhaps this phenomenon has globalized and it has become a much more strategic

01:00:40
government.

01:00:44
Well, they much more than see forceful government strategy.

01:00:48
So this is in a way mainstream urban development by now.

01:00:49
OK.

01:00:51
Looking at the time, let's take a quick break,

01:00:54
and then I'll continue with the second part,

01:00:56

01:11:51
All right, let's continue.

01:12:01
[ Inaudible ]

01:12:11
[ Inaudible ]

01:12:34
[ Inaudible ]

01:12:36
>> Yeah, okay. Let's go.

01:12:39
So we're still in the symbolic economy part.

01:12:43
And I'm discussing different strands, or what I mean.

01:12:45
This is less identified by me.

01:12:47
So what I consider to be a relatively clear

01:12:49
and body literature will then

01:12:50
this body of literature, there are a number

01:12:54
of different strands of, let's say, research attention.

01:12:57
So before I just finished the part on

01:13:00
let's see cultural redevelopment.

01:13:02
Now in last part within that section,

01:13:05
I would argue really focuses on read presentation

01:13:06
of her misplaced.

01:13:08
Now please understand every strand that I discuss,

01:13:11
I can only do so much in a two hour lecture,

01:13:13
in the mind of the Greeks.

01:13:16
But please understand every strand as potential,

01:13:18
let's say, lives of investigation for yourself.

01:13:21
Or a favor for the master thesis, whatever, right?

01:13:24
Just trying to let's say, hopefully,

01:13:26
give some inspiration as to what possible teams,

01:13:29
possible topics are that you might want to engage with

01:13:30
in more detail.

01:13:32
So this is also for me a bit,

01:13:35
what I see as my role in,

01:13:37
especially for those here and their first semester

01:13:41
on the first year master, what I see as my role.

01:13:43
Just giving a few, let's say, foreigners,

01:13:46
there's a few ideas about what could potentially

01:13:48
be interesting to do more research about.

01:13:49
Yeah?

01:13:52
So one element here is re-placitation of urban space.

01:13:56
This is probably a relatively straight forward exercise

01:13:57
where a lot of attention recently,

01:14:02
especially outside of urban studies, in marketing,

01:14:03
it's true to anything you're boring,

01:14:05
but still there's not a discussion,

01:14:07
but we should investigate the role of media

01:14:13
marketing and putting cities on the map. I should say, no one. There's a lot of

01:14:16
boring research being done in this field. There's also some interesting research

01:14:21
being done in this field. But some of this is very instrumental. So there's this

01:14:26
research that focuses on urban images, what kind of interests do we have in mind

01:14:30
when we think about cities, how it can lead to change geosemages, or some contested

01:14:35
images. And we all will have, let's say, city images in our mind, when we're not

01:14:39
I've got to do the quiz now, but they would ask you to sort of, I would mention a city,

01:14:45
I would ask you to mention the first English that pops up in your hat.

01:14:50
Then it's quite clear there will be a large element of consensus, I think, within the audience.

01:14:52
Paris, Eiffel Tower, I mean something like that, right?

01:14:55
So the couple of cliches.

01:15:00
This has become increasingly important in debates also around urban tourism.

01:15:05
Especially in your experiences, I've always been key sites for tourism.

01:15:09
Yes, so there's the grand tour, there's the upper middle classes,

01:15:15
aristocrats, European elites who have a travel to and around

01:15:17
two different European cities.

01:15:19
But as we come, let's say,

01:15:24
Massified over the last 60, 70 years from the after world for two.

01:15:28
And it was really that same to let it's own development around her maturity.

01:15:32
And, of course, that's it, the whole discussion about her energy

01:15:34
will also fit in here.

01:15:36
Yeah?

01:15:37
This has increased.

01:15:39
It also been picked up where you could say it was, to some

01:15:42
extent, firm driven.

01:15:44
That's the entrepreneur driven.

01:15:45
This has increased.

01:15:48
It's been picked up by most local and national states as

01:15:52
important development strategies for the local national regard,

01:15:55
which has really really with the focus on tourism as the

01:15:57
important driver for the economy.

01:15:59
It's a highly volatile economy, of course.

01:16:02
This is something we now see with COVID to, well,

01:16:04
it's a very clear sense.

01:16:06
It's only everything falls flat,

01:16:09
and that's for locally cars that rely heavily on tourism,

01:16:13
that's obviously is quite a disaster.

01:16:14
You can now be speaking of course,

01:16:17
socially speaking that's another discussion.

01:16:19
That is a nice book also, that's why it's a national here,

01:16:22
not when it's trusted by many people,

01:16:25
but they are greenback, how, you're outside.

01:16:27
Branding to the world, how a Sydney crisis

01:16:32
sold to the world, which traces a bit, let's say, the branding of the York from the 1980s

01:16:40
onwards, our city at the bottom ends being confronted with out migration. I can try to reinvent

01:16:46
itself through its images in order to become, let's say, more attractive again. Open question,

01:16:51
of course, if the branding has played the most important role in the city become more attractive,

01:16:55
what's already has played a role in this.

01:17:01
Okay. Last part in the role of the States, very briefly.

01:17:04
Again, this is the debate that has been picked up,

01:17:07
both in our mistakes as well as our side of our mistakes

01:17:09
for a culture perspective, especially in those

01:17:11
who are specifically on cultural policies,

01:17:15
which is a dedicated field of research on its own.

01:17:19
Which I would say you see a couple of things.

01:17:22
We see strategies aimed at really developing culture industries.

01:17:24
I have myself done research on this older

01:17:27
data around culture industries, which is very much about

01:17:29
local economic development.

01:17:32
It's a data that you actually attract artists, culture

01:17:37
workers, to your city, in order to develop economic economies.

01:17:40
Much research attention has gone into this since the 1990s,

01:17:42
but especially 2000s.

01:17:45
There's also research around large scale events,

01:17:47
world fairs, art exhibitions.

01:17:50
Again, this hasn't much, much longer history.

01:17:52
They transcend also, are we studies as a discipline?

01:17:54
Because if you look at, let's see,

01:17:57
a discipline such as art history

01:18:00
that has done excellent work on, let's say,

01:18:03
art exhibitions and world fairs

01:18:05
from the mid-19th century onwards.

01:18:07
Yeah, so the hour always, let's see,

01:18:11
depends to attract the global or is European audience

01:18:12
to your city.

01:18:15
But again, this has become increasingly

01:18:20
kind of economic strategy. So you want to attract your Olympic games, you want to attract

01:18:26
a biennial or you want to add a biennial etc. There's also been increased in critique because

01:18:33
often there's a lot of investment going into this but what actually delivers tends then

01:18:38
turns out to be quite limited. And more broadly I think there's literature again from the 1980s

01:18:43
onwards, why should we do more for the zuchen on the arts and the urban growth machine as it was

01:18:46
called to the 1980s, certainly, which really focuses on us

01:18:52
seeing art networks, the elite networks, and arts institutions

01:18:57
as local attractors for inward investment and urban development.

01:18:59
So there's a classic example, if you look at the--

01:19:04
in the position of the Google Cloud Museum in Google Cloud,

01:19:08
that's an always-maintured case when it comes to a new place

01:19:11
museum in the relatively rundown city.

01:19:14
simplifying here and this would really boost the local economy.

01:19:16
And to some extent it did.

01:19:18
Again, if many issues attached to it,

01:19:21
what is not complete before us.

01:19:25
So there, this is work that has received a lot of attention also.

01:19:29
Here, one more recent example.

01:19:33
Not sure if the city needed, you could say this.

01:19:36
It was certainly not around rundown city in a sense.

01:19:37
Does anyone notice an example?

01:19:46
So it's M+ museum in Hong Kong actually, which actually was just open I think two, one

01:19:54
or two weeks ago, two weeks ago designed by Star Architects, Herzog in the Miron, and a

01:20:01
typical, you could see an example of a city that is both aimed at attracting and perhaps

01:20:06
improving to the cultural image of Hong Kong, but attracting, let's say tourism to the city,

01:20:13
But also as a kind of advertisement for the C.

01:20:15
And there's some extent in the very little sense,

01:20:20
because the main real insight is one big LCD screen

01:20:21
at the same time next to being a museum.

01:20:24
So you could actually sort of literally see how this is

01:20:26
a kind of commodity style, right?

01:20:31
So a very, very literal manner.

01:20:33
But also for example, big commercial art experience,

01:20:36
So this is our Basel, who developed, let's say,

01:20:38
well, which is now staging.

01:20:40
I'm not quite sure what the current state is,

01:20:43
because also, COVID really messed up a lot.

01:20:45
But what it was is staging annual art fairs,

01:20:47
and Basel, and Miami, and Hong Kong.

01:20:50
Not only did these events attract

01:20:52
well-teated visitors by and large.

01:20:54
Yeah, they also spent there in these cities.

01:20:57
So again, it becomes a kind of local development machine.

01:20:58
Yeah?

01:21:01
Well, recently our Basel also started a so-called

01:21:03
our Basel series initiative,

01:21:06
where we try to have events in different cities,

01:21:08
which in this case, when as I was,

01:21:12
it's one example, which supposedly should benefit our Basel,

01:21:13
because it can globalize more,

01:21:15
but also other things across the world

01:21:17
would be not at an annual artist,

01:21:19
and suppose we benefit from us

01:21:21
in the name of the reputation of our Basel.

01:21:24
And we see these kinds of initiatives emerging

01:21:26
quite forcefully over the last,

01:21:28
especially over the last 10, 15 years.

01:21:30
Okay.

01:21:36
Last section for today, and I'm actually doing quite well

01:21:37
at the time.

01:21:41
So I also won't discuss this,

01:21:44
unless not every bullet point on the slide.

01:21:49
But just as a kind of wrapping up,

01:21:52
to reposition, let's say my debate,

01:21:56
which was let's see mostly oriented within urban geography,

01:21:58
but to reposition again within the broader debate

01:22:09
on the spatial term. As much of what I discussed, what I showed you, graph of concern, or do you go to graph of concerns? But the spatial term more broadly frames that count of the data.

01:22:18
So, just to wrap up, in the late 2020 century, urban geography was heavily influenced by the cultural term. This I discussed.

01:22:22
So I related the base in postmodernism and globalization.

01:22:27
This has had to, in effect, let's say the epistemological and mythological effect was that

01:22:33
there was an increased interest in ethnography, everyday life, imaginaries, re-presentations

01:22:35
or in short culture.

01:22:42
So this really what I think has shaped much of urban geography over the last 30 years.

01:22:46
Across the social sciences, this is how I opened my lecture of the day.

01:22:52
This cultural turn intertwined with increased interest in spatial configurations.

01:22:58
So that's the urban geography has already been introduced to cultural questions, to cultural

01:23:02
disciplines, which I would say is cultural studies and anthropology.

01:23:05
We became more interested in spatial questions.

01:23:09
So there were a number of reasons for this.

01:23:12
One is, I addressed this in some other lectures.

01:23:17
there's a kind of really post 1989 obsession with globalization. On one level and

01:23:23
superficial level globalization is the end of spatial questions because

01:23:28
everything is global. But it actually intensified this concern with spatial

01:23:33
questions because it soon became clear of course that it was a process that

01:23:37
actually had spatial effects and it was spatial process. It was a stretching of

01:23:43
of social relations taking place, which could be and needed to be understood in a spatial

01:23:44
manner.

01:23:49
Connecting A to B as a spatial effect and it leads to a different spatial configuration.

01:23:54
I have social sciences humanities, sorry.

01:23:55
Yeah.

01:23:58
I don't want to be able to fit everything on an already two crowded slide.

01:24:04
I had to sort of, yeah, so across the social sciences and humanities.

01:24:06
So the creative interest in spatial questions.

01:24:07
in spatial questions.

01:24:10
So this of course, where the geography starts becoming

01:24:13
an inspirational discipline for other disciplines.

01:24:17
This is exactly what happens in the '99s especially.

01:24:19
Hence, the increase in interaction

01:24:21
with your own job, your methodology, and cultural studies,

01:24:23
which are already hinted at.

01:24:29
I'm only going to go quickly through this,

01:24:33
but the slides are slightly more detailed

01:24:37
because I added these slides because not, let's say,

01:24:41
the elements I discussed in the previous slides,

01:24:43
the previous one hour and 20 minutes or so,

01:24:48
cover I would say most of what is relevance,

01:24:51
concerning the culture and urban geography

01:24:53
over the last 30, 40 years,

01:24:54
which has already quite a challenge to fit that

01:24:58
into a two hour lecture, but it really misses also some elements.

01:24:59
So, I mean, I proposed, let's say,

01:25:02
quite a day in a way, a linear trajectory

01:25:03
of how previous discussions,

01:25:04
influence current discussions,

01:25:06
and that had an effect on this.

01:25:08
But in parallel, of course, there were also discussions.

01:25:10
And I just want to briefly end at it,

01:25:12
because there's again,

01:25:14
these are almost, and then we've got more or less important,

01:25:16
but we can't really necessarily trace back

01:25:18
to some of the elements to, let's say,

01:25:20
Frannie Jameson, for example.

01:25:24
So there are two core teams, perhaps,

01:25:26
that have also really shaped

01:25:30
into disciplinary urban studies over the last couple of years,

01:25:34
and that we have emerged more forcefully

01:25:36
from the disciplines outside of geography.

01:25:39
But it's definitely that informing urban studies

01:25:43
at large, for me, is a very interdisciplinary discipline

01:25:46
optimistic to elements.

01:25:50
One, informality, second, everyday life.

01:25:53
Informality for those that have studied ethnography

01:25:55
and anthropology, they will become,

01:25:57
well, it will be quite familiar with this term.

01:26:01
This, in the story, I give some examples there.

01:26:03
The religion that looks specifically on

01:26:06
coming from also the development perspective,

01:26:07
or the developmental lists,

01:26:09
perspectives to some extent,

01:26:11
focusing on labor markets, precarious work,

01:26:14
migration, legality, political governance

01:26:17
and conversation, our unpacked this in a minute.

01:26:20
Everyday life, partially overlapping,

01:26:23
but partially coming from where this tends to come,

01:26:25
we're simplifying it from anthropology,

01:26:30
and our company life tends to come from what I would say is cultural studies as a discipline

01:26:36
of the immersion in 1980s, focused very much on agency, community community, women, resistance,

01:26:43
often on local level, often lifestyle, really consumption, identity, media and representation.

01:26:48
So when precisely these terms, those are the newspapers, political rights, there's this

01:26:53
obsession with some of these terms as that they want to critique and then emerge and think

01:26:57
more closely from cultural studies. Obviously, the clinics have never read cultural studies,

01:27:00
but that's another discussion.

01:27:07
Let me see. Now, in formality, I'm actually going to see it because this has become a

01:27:12
special last 10 years of studies. There's so much research taking place now on informality

01:27:17
and the urban. But it's important to keep in mind that this was already a classic team

01:27:22
within urban anthropology and development economics, especially from the early 1970s

01:27:27
on this. An article always references the one by Keith Hart in formal income opportunities

01:27:32
in urban employment in Ghana and in the title itself already makes pretty clear what's

01:27:37
well, where he stands and what the topic is, right? It is really about local labour markets.

01:27:41
It's about local economic development, yeah? But what did Keith Hart and many others

01:27:46
with an argue? There is a lot of, and I think it's something that maybe she was an ominous

01:27:51
lecture for European citizen or urbanising world also picked up on what is registered to

01:27:57
be part of the economy is only part of what is what you should consider as economic

01:27:58
activities.

01:28:03
So we have formal economic practices, businesses that pay taxes and that are registered

01:28:09
as businesses, but there's a lot of employment beyond these formal economic practices.

01:28:16
So beyond governments, beyond firms, beyond factories, beyond large-scale economies.

01:28:19
So this is where the distinction between informal and formal comes from.

01:28:23
So this is important to keep in mind.

01:28:28
This, of course, gets slippery because in some literature, this and this comes together.

01:28:33
And we say, well, I actually did formalist illegitimate and informal is the legitimate, but

01:28:35
that is only partial, but partial, true.

01:28:37
I mean, we can have discussion about what's legitimate.

01:28:43
But that's, for example, we'll all agree that someone taking care at home of their children

01:28:45
that are constantly exploring, but we do.

01:28:49
I think that both the All-Solary that is not illegitimate to the

01:28:51
contemporary, well, far from it, right?

01:28:57
So where has dropped trafficking is probably informal

01:29:00
because it's not registered as such, but many would also

01:29:01
consider legitimate.

01:29:04
Again, we can have a discussion on this if that makes sense

01:29:06
that distinction.

01:29:08
But this is how it comes to the emerge.

01:29:10
And this is interesting because there's one of, not few

01:29:13
concepts, but one of the key concepts that have really

01:29:18
traveled from the global south to the global north. So this is where it worked that

01:29:23
he emerged most forcefully in the research on the global south. And this is what it was

01:29:28
really sort of the travel that says to the global north. That doesn't happen too often

01:29:33
you could say. So I mean in terms such as postmodern urbanism in a way is the opposite

01:29:40
example.

01:29:54
Now an urban anthropology, if you look at informality, it needs a lot of research on opportunities,

01:30:00
but also precarious precarity created by unregulated economic activities.

01:30:03
So there's strong interest in gender dimensions.

01:30:07
So people are working on markets, working at home.

01:30:08
So this is really about, let's see,

01:30:12
what the bread and butter of a lot of urban anthropology,

01:30:14
as well as transnational dimensions.

01:30:15
Particularly this is the mention of the thing

01:30:17
that has been picked up most clearly

01:30:20
in the more cultural work in early studies.

01:30:22
So for example, many street founders

01:30:24
also do transnational migrants here

01:30:26
in a picture of La Amalana and Barcelona.

01:30:29
So illegal migrants are doing working

01:30:33
on the city, and it raises questions of economic survival,

01:30:37
most obviously, but also questions of the governance

01:30:41
of the political identity of these actors

01:30:44
or the cultural identity of these actors.

01:30:45
And with an enormous study, there's

01:30:47
a big amount of research, which has really

01:30:51
led to a boom, I think, of research and informal,

01:30:52
and on formal urbanism.

01:30:55
You know, I pick up some of these elements in my lecture

01:30:57
next week.

01:30:58
Now, that's very brief.

01:31:03
I mean, I could have two, three lectures for sure on informality as a concept, as a practice,

01:31:06
and how it's picked up in different strands of research.

01:31:10
Just as a kind of stepping stone, please understand this as a stepping stone to, let's say,

01:31:14
the more contemporary research that I will discuss next week.

01:31:19
The second strand of research, which has been much part of us in a forced modern urbanism

01:31:24
drag, this is what we call in drag, is the literature on everyday life.

01:31:29
I myself have been partially trained in cultural studies and everyday life was a concept

01:31:32
that popped up that it was regularly used all the time.

01:31:41
From the late 1980s, 1990s onwards, it was really used as a key topic.

01:31:44
What does the term basically entail in most cases?

01:31:46
Because ultimately, it's also not more than a bus work.

01:31:48
There's a lot of theory behind it.

01:31:53
But ultimately, it entails a key concern with lift experiences of people and the meanings

01:32:01
constructed by subjects in their own world. So classic cultural concerns, if you wish.

01:32:08
So most of this literature and cultural studies on everyday life tends to also position

01:32:12
people as active agents, rather than as passive consumers or passive recipients of political

01:32:18
power. So this automatically leads to this kind of debate on strategies for tactics and

01:32:21
So the resistance people can have on the ground

01:32:24
in relation to the structures they are confronted with.

01:32:26
Well, they are confronted with.

01:32:30
I'll skip this part because there's also another part

01:32:33
in anthropology which also addresses it.

01:32:38
And this also makes, I think, the everyday

01:32:40
it truly transdisciplinary concept.

01:32:43
I mean, again, there are not too many concepts

01:32:45
that are truly transdisciplinary.

01:32:47
I try to understand urban studies as a discipline

01:32:49
that is much broader than specific disciplinary debates

01:32:53
because it's just fairly boring to stick to one discipline.

01:32:56
But the everyday has really emerged from the 97,

01:32:59
97 as it truly translates to an early concept.

01:33:01
So again, similar to the postmodern,

01:33:04
I think a question that was raised at the back,

01:33:06
there is no such thing as one postmodern.

01:33:08
If you look at different disciplines

01:33:10
to really be at the standard postmodern,

01:33:12
it's quite substantially different

01:33:14
and sometimes even contradictory,

01:33:16
the same applies to the everyday.

01:33:19
when one discipline or one order says about D every day,

01:33:21
might not overlap to a grade degree

01:33:23
with one another or on the right spot the every day.

01:33:26
So you really have to look at disciplinary specifics

01:33:28
in order to understand this.

01:33:33
Nevertheless, it has emerged as a term, as a concept

01:33:35
that really connects cultural theory

01:33:37
with philosophy, with Marxism,

01:33:39
and Alfred P. P. P. P. with post-structuralism,

01:33:42
with sociology and with aesthetics.

01:33:45
So the many interesting, let's see, Andrew Porns also P. P. P.

01:33:49
So, for instance, specifically, next to the unavoidable hornet in the favor,

01:33:54
the every day, who sees the every day as a side of utopian possibility,

01:33:59
but also colonize but a commodity form, so that's commodity aesthetics once again.

01:34:04
I can only urge you, and of course, honker the favor is great, we all like him, etc.

01:34:08
But there's also a lot of interesting work that has been done by other artists, which is perhaps,

01:34:13
at least as relevant, let's put it in those terms, than honker the favor.

01:34:16
Please, no, no, no, no more papers on the right to the city.

01:34:17
I've read enough of those.

01:34:20
That's, yeah.

01:34:22
For example, Stuart Hall and Tony Jackson,

01:34:24
classic British cultural studies.

01:34:27
Some of you might be familiar with this over there work.

01:34:30
Especially Stuart Hall, I mean, if not, the readers work,

01:34:33
because it's pretty, well, it's very, very good.

01:34:35
For really looked at, looked at,

01:34:37
as he sub-fulchers, and every day

01:34:40
as a symbolic opposition to a dominant order,

01:34:42
I'm just mentioning some key words that talk up here,

01:34:46
that we determine knowledge and the thing which has become internalized in much

01:34:52
of our thinking about urban cultures, resistant style, social practices, sub-told use

01:34:55
code, urban use identity.

01:34:56
Yeah?

01:35:01
Terminality that was not used for the first time by Stuart Halden others, but they really

01:35:02
theorized it.

01:35:04
And they really did something new.

01:35:05
Yeah?

01:35:09
One caveat of course is especially early cultural studies work.

01:35:13
It was highly blind to gender, gender dynamics.

01:35:16
Yeah, this was, I mean, the picture shows it was,

01:35:20
youth subculture was very much around male youth subculture.

01:35:21
Yeah?

01:35:23
This is Washington addressed by a lot of such

01:35:25
as ancient I met Robbie.

01:35:29
It was actually my first huge supervisor

01:35:30
and feminist cultural studies.

01:35:33
But certainly, let's see, you kind of

01:35:35
underlying trend in the early culture studies tradition

01:35:38
that it was pretty blind to gender issues.

01:35:42
or supporting intersectional other intersection issues.

01:35:44
From quite a different angle, but again,

01:35:46
and they are an amazing book, very thin book.

01:35:49
So he's the reader that's very well written.

01:35:53
The practice of everyday life by Michel de Sertou.

01:35:55
I'm at the business translation, obviously.

01:35:58
I think the French is maybe 10 years old

01:36:01
and more of any of the original.

01:36:04
More poetic, but maybe folks in practice, tactics,

01:36:06
versus strategies.

01:36:09
So the idea being that strategies are top down

01:36:13
and people on the street, they sort of engage with this

01:36:17
and develop tactics in order to avoid state strategies

01:36:18
with mostly government strategies.

01:36:24
So tactics are situated, tactics as resisting,

01:36:27
let's say broader structures.

01:36:29
This again has very much shapes.

01:36:30
I'm not saying that everything is good about it

01:36:32
because it's too dichotomous,

01:36:35
but it's a very influential book

01:36:38
that has reshaped much of the data at home.

01:36:40
Could next we will talk a bit more about, let's say,

01:36:43
from the everyday to cultural work and activism,

01:36:47
bit more about DIY organism, where some of the DIY

01:36:49
urbanism literature, for example,

01:36:51
in listening or explicit and first to the cutout

01:36:54
of stuff that is subtorted already in 1980s.

01:37:02
Okay, just to conclude, as I mentioned,

01:37:09
The cultural term is to be understood as part of a wider shift in analytical sensibilities

01:37:11
in the social sciences.

01:37:17
I mean at the very beginning I said okay, the empirical theoretical and the methodological,

01:37:24
these are three takes on how at that point we started looking differently at the

01:37:25
world.

01:37:26
Yeah?

01:37:34
So, urban geography itself as one strand of debate within this broader cultural term was

01:37:37
And here's how you heavily influence by Marxist

01:37:39
or at least political economic interpretation

01:37:42
of postmodernism as the cultural expression

01:37:44
of late capitalism.

01:37:45
Yeah?

01:37:46
You can also phrase differently.

01:37:51
There's very little subtle nuance, cultural readings

01:37:55
of, let's say, symbolic objects such as the arts

01:37:56
in urban geography.

01:37:59
For that, mostly you have to move outside of geography

01:38:01
because it does not have this history

01:38:05
of taking suddenly about, let's say, cultural expressions.

01:38:07
Which doesn't mean it's not good, but it's limited

01:38:09
in that respect.

01:38:11
The work in symbolic economy, and the labels on this,

01:38:14
but it has shifted attention a bit more

01:38:16
to questions of re-presentation,

01:38:18
to urban lifestyles and culture production.

01:38:21
So the postmodern urbanism school

01:38:24
was, wasn't interested that much in artists

01:38:28
producing actual pieces of work in an actual art.

01:38:29
It was most interested in consumption.

01:38:31
Yes, come on, there's studies.

01:38:35
you buy something with which you identify as a lifestyle question.

01:38:38
And we see the last part that I then discussed.

01:38:40
We see an increasing or we saw an increasing

01:38:44
a rough question more, a sort of meeting and a health rate.

01:38:47
Between urban geography, cultural studies and anthropology

01:38:49
as part of a broader spatial term.

01:38:51
So this is the funny thing of interesting thing

01:38:53
is that this cultural term often also

01:38:55
until the spatial term.

01:38:58
And it came as the emerge together in many ways.

01:39:02
The last point I'll discuss is the research and informality

01:39:04
and everyday life and related concerns

01:39:07
as enormously contributed to a development

01:39:08
of a truly interdisciplinary,

01:39:11
transdisciplinary form of cultural urban studies.

01:39:12
I think these are some of the,

01:39:15
some of you see this happening in social science

01:39:15
and science and science,

01:39:19
that are not just at certain concepts, just resonates.

01:39:21
We had research coming from very different traditions

01:39:24
and then we come, let's say, bridging concepts

01:39:26
that bring together very different ways

01:39:29
of thinking very different histories of writing

01:39:30
And this is where most of them are--

01:39:34
well, the most exciting stuff happens I would argue.

01:39:39
OK, next week, this is what I will try to discuss.

01:39:42
So today, my main claim is history matters.

01:39:44
So the history of urban studies that I just

01:39:47
discussed shapes also current research debates

01:39:48
on urban cultures.

01:39:51
And before strands, I will try this class

01:39:52
with you next week.

01:39:54
So it is more.

01:39:58
But I do think that this is pretty exhaustive at the same time

01:40:02
are one on the arts, activism, and urban engagements.

01:40:04
Just one strand.

01:40:06
The second one specifically focusing on culture

01:40:08
of infrastructure and informal urbanism.

01:40:10
Probably a bit more on a culture infrastructure site

01:40:12
than the informal site.

01:40:16
A third one on urban tourism and consumption cultures.

01:40:19
And a fourth one, which links most close

01:40:21
and think to the methodological concerns, perhaps.

01:40:24
It's also as a variable at the same time.

01:40:25
Folks on sensory urbanism.

01:40:27
So different kinds of, let's see,

01:40:31
engaging with German beyond the visual and text.

01:40:33
Again, there's only so much I can do

01:40:35
into two hours that I have next week,

01:40:38
but hopefully this gives you a pretty good overview

01:40:41
of what cultures of urban research

01:40:43
and urban cultures can be about.

01:40:44
Okay, I'll leave it there,

01:40:46
and I'm very fast for today.

01:40:47
Any questions?

01:40:50
No, everyone happy to go home at quality seven

01:40:53
on a Monday evening, then I will see you next week

01:40:54
if I don't see you in the fall.

01:40:57

# 7 Urban cultures

00:00:08
I'll start recording immediately because I forgot to start recording for the lecture of

00:00:10
clear, at least for part of this.

00:00:12
Let me see here.

00:00:19
[no audio]

00:00:26
[no audio]

00:00:36
[no audio]

00:00:59
[Silence]

00:01:01
Can everyone hear me?

00:01:04
Yeah, I see shaking ass those goods.

00:01:07
I now also open to chat.

00:01:10
I finally found out how to build the chat while

00:01:13
being in a formal presenting mode.

00:01:16
I think it's about time to start.

00:01:20
Welcome to the second lecture for urban social geography,

00:01:24
where I'll be spending the next two hours.

00:01:30
Let's see how much time we need for electric urban cultures.

00:01:33
So as you remember in the last session,

00:01:35
I largely gave an historical overview of what I consider

00:01:39
to be essential, let's say, core coordinates

00:01:42
of thinking about culture in urban geography

00:01:45
and more widely some other, let's say,

00:01:48
related to discipline, starting with a brief discussion,

00:01:50
well, but there are relatively specifically discussion

00:01:54
on Fred O.G. Jameson and his notion of postmodernism,

00:01:56
moving to the shift of, moving to, let's say,

00:02:01
the 1980s, early 1990s debate on postmodern urbanism

00:02:04
and the LA School of Urbanism,

00:02:07
and then shifting to a wider,

00:02:10
but also related to the bait on the symbolic economy.

00:02:14
Those were the key coordinates that I tried to get across.

00:02:16
One of the questions, well,

00:02:17
you can't see the slides.

00:02:19
Can everyone see the slides?

00:02:21
Oh, that's odd.

00:02:22
Thank you for asking the question

00:02:25
because I'm actually screen sharing now.

00:02:31
Let me just see, I'll just stop sharing.

00:02:41
should be able to see this lights. Another sec. Share screen. I'll do it like this

00:02:52
done. So do this. Just a sec. Okay, now see my screen. Except that I can't see

00:03:00
you now just a sec. This is lots. I don't know one near you.

00:03:09
You never see the slides now? I see one yes thank you so I hope that's okay. Perfect. Okay.

00:03:15
Okay thanks a lot. Yeah feel free to unmute sometimes that's easier than working with

00:03:25
sign language. The only thing is I can see you now. Let me see where is that. Just

00:03:28
want to say, oh here we are. Okay, now I see you and hopefully you see me and we see

00:03:35
the slides. You did hear what I was saying, right? So okay, let's keep it from there.

00:03:39
So what I tried to get across last week is what I just discussed. I tried to give an historic

00:03:43
overview of some of the core elements that I thought I think were are important. Thinking

00:03:48
about every culture over the last 30, 40 years actually. Open some people in the waiting room.

00:03:57
My life is so easy. Let me see. Before you start working here, where are we? No, no, no, no.

00:04:05
I'll stop sharing again. I'll admit all again at some point it becomes a bit tricky. Then people

00:04:12
that just have to wait for the next pause, otherwise it becomes difficult. Because with the

00:04:15
session of clear I could actually manage this but since I don't have an

00:04:19
assistant next to me this is what will work with okay next round we'll

00:04:24
we'll go for another ride here we go

00:04:30
Jabs and starts

00:04:39
this is valid that I don't see you anymore

00:04:40
Here we are.

00:04:41
There we are.

00:04:42
Okay.

00:04:43
Getting there.

00:04:46
So, for the third time.

00:04:49
I tried to give an historical overview.

00:04:51
One of the questions I received last week is okay.

00:04:56
Are we going to learn more about actual cultures, so cultural expressions, stuff that

00:04:59
interests us as 20 years, 20 years.

00:05:01
That's what I remember.

00:05:04
So the question to the answer to that question is yes.

00:05:10
In the session today, I will focus a bit more in detail on specific, well, I will always focus on

00:05:16
research on urban culture, but look, assuming in more specifically on research that looks at

00:05:22
actual cultural expressions, but always from perspective as to how this has been done in urban

00:05:27
studies. There are many other disciplines, of course, that focus on culture or cultural expressions

00:05:31
coming from the humanities in particular, but I will largely zoom in on how this has been

00:05:34
in approach within urban studies.

00:05:40
That will hopefully become clear or clearer in a minute.

00:05:42
Before I do so, I want to broaden the debate a bit

00:05:44
beyond urban geography per se.

00:05:47
And I show some of the slides and discuss some of the slides

00:05:50
that I also already mentioned last week.

00:05:55
Because if you look at the way urban geography

00:05:57
has undergone its own cultural term,

00:05:59
as I hinted at last week,

00:06:03
What we saw happening in parallel is that many other disciplines

00:06:05
within the social science and humanities

00:06:07
have also undergone a kind of spatial turn.

00:06:09
So we've seen a kind of meeting health way,

00:06:12
a kind of rapprochement between geography becoming

00:06:14
a more cultural discipline,

00:06:16
but other disciplines also becoming more

00:06:19
becoming more geographical becoming more spatial.

00:06:24
So this cultural, this spatial turn had a number of reasons

00:06:27
as I already mentioned I think last week.

00:06:31
What did I'm being a post-1989 obsession with globalization?

00:06:34
So the moment you start thinking seriously about globalization,

00:06:37
you quasi automatically start thinking about spatial issues

00:06:40
about geographical issues because if it's here,

00:06:41
but also somewhere else,

00:06:43
you start thinking about connections.

00:06:46
The other one being a kind of critique of modernity,

00:06:47
which had really shaped

00:06:49
that they most of the social science and humanities debate

00:06:51
up until the 1970s,

00:06:55
which primarily sort of paid attention to temporal issues

00:07:01
time because that's the very logic of taking in terms of modernity. So what we've seen over

00:07:06
the years since the late 1970s, roughly speaking, is we've seen it's kind of de-emphasizing

00:07:15
of temporal issues and an emphasizing of spatial issues. And this is where the spatial turn comes in.

00:07:20
So this in turn, and this is what I want to briefly focus on for the opening of this today's

00:07:26
session, led to an increased interaction between urban geography, urban anthropology, and cultural

00:07:30
studies. Many other disciplines also, but for me those are some of the core disciplines that really

00:07:38
shaped the future of the research on urban culture at large.

00:07:42
Now there are

00:07:59
A number of core teams in urban anthropology and and or cultural studies that has shaped the late 20th century early 21st century trajectory of what I consider to be let's say interdisciplinary urban studies.

00:08:05
I'm not going to give a review here of urban anthropology or cultural studies. They're both fascinating disciplines.

00:08:08
I heard a lot more than most disciplines.

00:08:13
I mean, I was trained in cultural studies myself before becoming a geography you could say.

00:08:20
But there are two, let's say, teams that I want to briefly flag here, which I think have

00:08:26
a much longer history in anthropology and cultural studies, which have really picked up

00:08:31
in this scenario of studies and shaped this debate up to the present day.

00:08:37
The first debate being around what I lay on here is informality, as it kind of debate

00:08:42
that emerged in anthropology and development studies,

00:08:45
largely focusing on informal economy, labor markets,

00:08:48
precarious work, migration issue of workers,

00:08:50
legality and illegality distinction,

00:08:53
but also the regulation, so the political governance

00:08:55
of infomality.

00:08:57
I'll give a few examples in a minute.

00:09:01
The second core team that I think is important to keep in mind

00:09:03
as a kind of understanding of the history

00:09:06
of research on urban culture is research on everyday life.

00:09:10
That's a term that you don't see the term used that much anymore.

00:09:15
I would say in the last 10 years or so, you still see it a lot, but less so as a theoretical

00:09:16
concept.

00:09:24
But it was a term that was pretty much dominoes in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s.

00:09:28
Largely used as a kind of shorthand or kind of bus work for referring to issues around

00:09:34
agency, community, community building, also resistance issues, as well as consumption identity

00:09:42
questions and related to representational questions, which then in turn had often a lot to do with how things were represented in media.

00:09:52
So, everyday life refers to many things, just as informality refers to many things, but if you would have to give a kind of nutshell summary, this life pretty much covers the other thing.

00:09:58
Now briefly, if you think about informality within

00:10:01
biologic urban anthropology and development studies,

00:10:05
it's a term that was less used in cultural studies.

00:10:09
It's a classic team, especially from the early 1970s onwards.

00:10:13
The core reference and perhaps the first person

00:10:16
who coined the idea of the informal economy,

00:10:17
that many others, of course,

00:10:19
who did research on the informal economy

00:10:23
without labeling it as such, was key to art

00:10:24
and one of the classic articles,

00:10:26
So one of the first articles there is

00:10:29
the article from 1973, which is a title

00:10:31
"Informal Income Opportunities and Urban Employment

00:10:32
in Ghana."

00:10:34
The article is such that the case

00:10:38
that he is such is less relevant than the understanding

00:10:40
as to what he coined to this article,

00:10:44
or how this has shaped, let's say, subsequent debates.

00:10:47
So hard primarily focused on a number of things.

00:10:49
He focused on actual employment,

00:10:52
so people making a living beyond government jobs,

00:10:56
beyond factories and beyond large scale companies.

00:10:58
You know, say, okay, there's a whole world out there

00:11:01
of how people make a living, especially in Ghana,

00:11:02
but he then sort of extrapolated this

00:11:04
to urban Africa at large.

00:11:07
Say, okay, there's a whole world out there of work

00:11:09
that we actually don't see.

00:11:10
We don't capture it.

00:11:13
We don't see it because we don't have to vocabulary

00:11:16
to really pay attention to it.

00:11:19
So that's the first observation he makes there.

00:11:21
He then makes it, he bases this on a distinction

00:11:23
to informal and formal labor.

00:11:26
It says, well, all vocabulary that we have

00:11:28
is largely catering to, especially for economics,

00:11:31
to capturing, registering, and registering,

00:11:33
and measuring formal labor.

00:11:36
So labor that actually shows up in GDP,

00:11:37
values, et cetera.

00:11:40
Labor that is actually taxed.

00:11:43
And a lot of the labor that we see in our Africa,

00:11:44
you argue it's not taxed as such,

00:11:47
or we don't see it for that reason.

00:11:49
So he introduced this distinction

00:11:52
informal labor, formal economy, formal employment,

00:11:53
and informal employment.

00:11:57
He also then makes a distinction between illegitimate

00:11:59
and legitimate labor where he said, okay,

00:12:01
the jitterments activity, which is not the same

00:12:03
as informal and formal.

00:12:07
He says, okay, we can't have informal activity according

00:12:11
to him, so economically, which is not measured as such,

00:12:13
which is still the jitterments, which he then argues

00:12:16
those are activities that do actually make a contribution

00:12:25
economic growth but at a small scale. So if you let's say sell foods on on a local market but

00:12:30
this is not captured you're not registered as an official business this according to them is

00:12:37
legitimate in formal activity which I think most of us can actually agree with. And then there's

00:12:42
illegitimate informal activity where it says well that can refer to criminal activities but also

00:12:48
to for example to bagging or bribery or corruption, which you consider to be illegitimate.

00:12:54
So there's a kind of four-fold distinction which is really shaped the thing to debate.

00:12:58
And you can question and disagree with some of the specifics of his argument, but the

00:13:02
way he structured his idea has been quite important.

00:13:07
Now, I mentioned this here not because I want to discuss with you Urban Africa or 1973

00:13:13
a key thought, but because I think some of the classical landmarks studies that he and others

00:13:18
have done in the early 1970s have informed the debates that followed elsewhere. Inframality

00:13:23
is an interesting concept because it's one of the few concepts you could argue that has

00:13:28
really seen a concept from the global south to the global north. So where most of us are

00:13:32
very well aware of critiques toward, let's say, urban studies saying, well, it's actually

00:13:37
Eurocentric or at least Western centric. Inframality is one of those concepts which you

00:13:39
you could say, "Start it in the global south,"

00:13:41
and actually has been picked up increasingly

00:13:43
in order to understand also practices

00:13:44
within the global north.

00:13:47
To such an extent, I would argue that it's one of the few

00:13:49
concepts which really transcends this kind of global south

00:13:52
global law divide and really sort of contributes to

00:13:55
thinking in terms of a global urban studies.

00:13:58
So if you look at work, for example, of Ananya Roy,

00:14:00
or Jennifer Robinson, they have picked up

00:14:04
on the informality topic as a way of also thinking about

00:14:06
urban studies in more global terms

00:14:09
without being, let's say, Eurocentric or Western century.

00:14:12
They're all kinds of related terms,

00:14:13
and they all have to do, let's say,

00:14:16
this monetary specifics,

00:14:18
that are pretty much trying to cover the same field,

00:14:19
but I won't discuss here,

00:14:22
such as unregistered economy, black markets,

00:14:24
the non-observe economy,

00:14:26
undeclared work, or the shadow or hidden economy.

00:14:29
And for those, let's say, more trade and feminist theory,

00:14:31
it's quite obvious, let's say,

00:14:34
that the distinction to informal and formal

00:14:37
Washington also maps onto the distinction

00:14:40
between public and private, with public activities,

00:14:43
often being seen as part of the form of an economy,

00:14:45
but let's say private activities such as care work,

00:14:47
being seen as the informal economy,

00:14:48
often also not measured,

00:14:52
and thus supposedly not worthy of attention.

00:14:54
And of course, this has overlapped

00:14:58
and been involved in rethinking the terms of that debate

00:15:00
to an important extent also.

00:15:03
So in urban anthropology,

00:15:07
thinking about informality, you get the research on the opportunities but also

00:15:12
precarries created by unregulated economic activities. I will give some examples later,

00:15:16
but it's quite obvious for example if we fast forward, let's say, to research on

00:15:20
creating cultural industries, and research that has now been done on precarious

00:15:26
precarious artistic labor, for example. It struggles with a similar tension, where

00:15:31
the to a large extent artistic labor is also unregulated, which creates all kinds of

00:15:36
freedoms and opportunities, but at the same time this let's say this unregulated nature,

00:15:40
which makes it very precarious because there's no way you can actually support, well,

00:15:45
let's say where a state or a welfare state of other mechanisms can actually structure

00:15:47
the kind of economic activities.

00:15:51
Urban anthropology and historically speaking has also seen a strong interest in the

00:15:52
gender dimensions.

00:15:55
Of informal works, I've already hinted at this.

00:16:01
Partially in the home situation, partially in mostly females being women working on markets,

00:16:07
etc. So all kinds of gender in the exclusions that are part of this discussion. And again,

00:16:12
they have shaped the debates in the decades that followed. Also important things that

00:16:17
urban anthropology we see in formality being linked strongly to transnational dimensions.

00:16:23
So with the idea that informal labor market informal urban labor markets are often also

00:16:30
highly transnational labor markets. On one level with diaspora connections, people sending back

00:16:40
they are there earnings or part of their earnings to their home country, but also with many migrants actually occupying informal labor markets in in countries in cities across the world.

00:16:55
So there's the transnational connection which urban anthropology certainly was among the first to pay attention to, which I see an increasing amount of research in in urban and interdisciplinary urban studies.

00:17:01
example of the Montevos and Barcelona, for example, who often have an African background and who have

00:17:05
would live in relative, if you precarious situations, well, very precarious situations in Spain,

00:17:11
being sort of legal, illegal, semi-legal in different kinds of statuses and trying to make a living

00:17:14
in this case, Barcelona.

00:17:24
So that's a five-minute summary of a 40-year debate in urban anthropology. So apologies for any

00:17:30
of lack of solities, but my discussion is relatively instrumental here, and that I want to get across them.

00:17:37
The key, let's say conceptual elements, conceptual nuggets, you could say, that that's also

00:17:43
shaped a bit in interdisciplinary urban studies. A second term that I'm sure you've come across

00:17:52
before in your reading is everyday life. Now, both anthropology, but especially in cultural studies,

00:17:58
This notion of everyday life really shifted the bait and signifies in many ways

00:18:02
it concerned with the lift experiences and meanings constructed by subjects in their own world.

00:18:10
Partially emerging you could save in the 1970s as a chronic critique of supposedly structuralism

00:18:16
Marxist theory being more attention to agency so it's part of that 1970s 1980s debate but then also

00:18:23
increasingly moving into a let's say substantive empirical research where research started

00:18:30
being attached to the actual lift experiences and meanings of people. So people's active creative

00:18:36
agents rather than as passive consumers, this is kind of what sort of the broads into disciplinary

00:18:43
sprawling debate of everyday life signifies. Now there are many connections there I think within

00:18:47
different disciplines that have in one way or another tried to engage with everyday life with

00:18:53
or without using the concept, one which I will only hint at, I think here, but which might

00:18:58
be discussed in some more detail by those that follow, not everyone does, but depending

00:19:02
on your program, those that follow urban sociology of Ava Swindeau, there's a kind of

00:19:07
tradition of community studies in anthropology and cultural studies, which historically

00:19:11
has focused on participant observation and extensive theories of field work to really

00:19:14
gain trust and insight knowledge of everyday practices.

00:19:16
So basically an anthropological stance, you could say,

00:19:19
you become part of a community.

00:19:21
And only through this insight knowledge,

00:19:23
you will actually understand the meanings

00:19:26
and interpretations attached to certain practices.

00:19:28
It of course also has a history going back

00:19:30
to the Chicago School with research

00:19:34
on also ethnographic research on urban areas

00:19:36
and various, let's say, urban topics,

00:19:38
such as gangs, I think segregation, lifestyle,

00:19:39
delinquency.

00:19:42
But there's also a rule connection

00:19:44
where a special within our associateiology,

00:19:47
let's say partially in parallel to the Chicago school,

00:19:50
which was always more urban in orientation,

00:19:51
where some classic community studies,

00:19:54
especially in the 1950s and 1960s,

00:19:57
sort of started applying, you could say rural concepts

00:20:00
of classic community studies to urban settings.

00:20:04
So going into a supposed community and a setting

00:20:05
and then focusing on, let's say,

00:20:07
family and kinship relations

00:20:09
or traditions or rituals.

00:20:14
This kind of community studies that a literature has been quite heavily criticized over

00:20:20
the years, largely for being too localist or for assuming community as relative homogenous,

00:20:26
which was already problematic, you would say in a rural setting, but certainly it's problematic

00:20:29
and it's much more dynamic than dynamic urban settings.

00:20:34
It's the idea that communities actually share same values was increasingly questioned.

00:20:40
Because the tradition there often, let's say, focusing on everyday life of these communities

00:20:45
was already established by this kind of, this kind of minutured.

00:20:49
There is somebody waiting in their reading.

00:20:54
Let's see, because every time when I have to, but I might be able to do it like this.

00:21:00
Nope, we're already in the process of this area.

00:21:01
Okay.

00:21:07
more. But I can do this all the time because it's quite interrupting so that I'll now start again.

00:21:13
You can still see me. Perfect, now I'll continue.

00:21:20
So especially from the 1980s onwards, I think we've seen a revival of the community studies

00:21:25
that moved beyond the kind of nostalgic motion of community. And this is where, so to

00:21:34
So again, the everyday life notions, well, returns in a way or becomes more present in

00:21:38
theorizing urban communities.

00:21:41
Some basic trends, and again, I just mentioned them here, but I think they basically

00:21:47
still structured a bit up to this day is that artists started using conflict theoretical

00:21:50
approach instead of collision theoretical approaches.

00:21:56
So looking at, let's say, interactions, obviously social interactions between actors, between

00:22:01
people, but also not sort of assuming, let's say, cohesion theoretically.

00:22:06
But assuming, let's say conflict theoretically, we could say very bluntly speaking, you

00:22:11
could say, instead moving from a dual-kymion perspective to a Marxist perspective.

00:22:16
That's very simplistic, but basically that's what covers to a certain extent the debates.

00:22:20
folks on network ties, local and trans local, I already mentioned this whenever I'm

00:22:25
anthropology, care and support and unequal and changing nervous settings.

00:22:30
And because of the, let's say the interest in, let's say, conflicts and how communities

00:22:35
are constructed, not how we, let's say, are assumed to be, there was increasing interest

00:22:38
to let's say the shifting symbolic boundaries between communities.

00:22:43
So they're sort of the making connection, but also making distinctions between, between

00:22:45
communities and between groups.

00:22:48
And then of course that opens up, let's say, the base

00:22:50
to not just communities as, let's say,

00:22:53
and uply, all the facts of social life,

00:22:55
but more into the base around communities of choice

00:22:57
and elected belonging.

00:23:00
So they can move into sub-cultures or LGBTQI communities,

00:23:02
but also gated communities, for example,

00:23:05
in urban settings, where people choose to belong

00:23:07
to a very separate community.

00:23:13
Now, the everyday is really a striking concept,

00:23:15
and let's say in the career of this concept,

00:23:18
because it's a truly transdisciplinary concept,

00:23:22
perhaps even more so than the informal informality.

00:23:23
Truly transdisciplinary,

00:23:26
maybe with a strong humanity background,

00:23:27
but really connecting cultural theory

00:23:29
with philosophy with Marxism,

00:23:31
with ethnography, with poststructuralism,

00:23:33
with sociology and with aesthetics.

00:23:35
That's precisely what makes this concept

00:23:36
that things so interesting,

00:23:40
was to influence you for research and our recalters.

00:23:41
Now you have to be careful here,

00:23:44
because the simple fact that a concept is used

00:23:48
all these different, let's say, traditions or disciplines, doesn't mean, of course, that

00:23:52
is used in the same way. So if you look, for example, that's, and there's no time to discuss

00:23:58
this here, but if you look, for example, that every day life in, in, let's say, ethnography,

00:24:03
it's quite different than every day life in aesthetics, and quite different than every day life,

00:24:09
let's say, in more post post structural literary theory. Yeah. So you have to be quite careful there.

00:24:14
But for every study is, I would argue, there are a number of approaches, which have really

00:24:20
let's say eternal references in a way, those artists that are continuously referenced.

00:24:25
One is the unavoidable home dealer, Fayetteville. Everyone references home dealer Fayetteville.

00:24:31
We see every day as a side of utopian possibility, but in line with, let's say, its Marxist

00:24:37
credentials also sees the everyday as colonized by the commodity form. So commodification,

00:24:42
logic, also shaping the everyday. That has been, of course, very influential thing.

00:24:48
in our studies to a large extent also because it's pretty compatible with the critical political

00:24:54
economic or studies approach. So people can claim or can become more interested in culture,

00:24:58
but don't actually don't have to leave. Let's say the house of political economy too far.

00:25:03
They can stay pretty close to that kind of debate. But I would also pay attention to other

00:25:07
moral, let's say perhaps empirically minded research, although still very theoretical,

00:25:12
and I will only mention two here, which have been equally at least influential, I think,

00:25:21
in urban studies. One being, the work by Stuart Hall, who is a massive towering figure, I think,

00:25:27
within cultural studies, British cultural studies at least, who looks at the everyday life,

00:25:31
largely true, you could see, especially in this book here, which is an additive book and a

00:25:38
compilation of classic classic papers of the British cultural studies center at that point in time,

00:25:42
the two looks at it to the subculture lens.

00:25:44
And the notion of subculture was coined

00:25:46
by British cultural studies.

00:25:48
And even though subculture is also word,

00:25:50
we tend not to use anymore.

00:25:54
Many of the, let's say, practices that we assumed

00:25:58
to shape subcultures are with us today.

00:26:00
So we might not name them subcultures anymore.

00:26:04
We might talk about the machines or about the networks

00:26:05
or something along those lines.

00:26:08
But the idea that subcultures are, let's say,

00:26:12
every day, but also are also kind of symbolic opposition

00:26:13
to a dominant social order.

00:26:17
This idea that they are one way or another resistance

00:26:19
is very influential, I think.

00:26:21
So if you look at the literature on, let's say,

00:26:24
subcultures, or let's say, neural literature

00:26:27
on protests, movements, or let's say clubbing culture,

00:26:31
it still uses these kinds of discounting for cavalry.

00:26:34
So that then directs attention,

00:26:40
to urban practices of resistance, but also style of fashion, of social practices,

00:26:44
or the particular codes that are used within a community,

00:26:49
added direct citation, I think also to a particular, let's say, generational category, namely urban youth.

00:26:53
Which I think was really, has always been a recent in a way,

00:26:58
but British cultural studies tradition has perhaps directed most of his attention

00:27:03
to, let's say, this particular category of this particular generational layer.

00:27:12
layer. Typical of ever also for British cultural studies at that one in time is a certain

00:27:17
gender blindness. If you look at, let's say the early cultural studies tradition, those that

00:27:22
did research on subcultures, by and large looked at used cultures as you could say, boyish,

00:27:28
masculine used cultures. So there's certainly a certain gender blindness in the kind of

00:27:31
resistant use cultural literature.

00:27:33
However, this has increasingly been addressed

00:27:35
in subsequent work, partially and bachu

00:27:38
this kind of collup cultures literature that I mentioned.

00:27:40
Also by the work of artists such as Angela Megrob

00:27:43
who was part of the Early British Cultural Studies Foundation

00:27:46
and is now a professor at Goldsmith's College

00:27:49
and who has really addressed this kind of literature

00:27:53
and this kind of gender dimension of cultural studies.

00:27:58
Another order, and this is only a book I can,

00:28:00
Well, the other book also, but I certainly recommend you

00:28:03
to read this book if only because it's a very pleasant read.

00:28:05
It's beautifully written.

00:28:06
And it's not a tick book.

00:28:08
I think it has around 200 pages max I think.

00:28:12
It's pretty readable.

00:28:14
It's Michel de Sato and it's--

00:28:14
and it's--

00:28:16
he's written many things on a really live,

00:28:18
but this perhaps the most heavily silent book,

00:28:21
the practice of everyday life of 1984.

00:28:24
The-- having said the term, the English translations

00:28:27
from 1984 if I'm not mistaken.

00:28:30
It might be later that the original Franget is actually

00:28:31
from that time.

00:28:32
I will even look it up.

00:28:33
I forgot.

00:28:34
It's beautifully written.

00:28:38
It's perhaps more poetic, I would say, and less political

00:28:40
than British cultural studies, or at least less

00:28:42
in your face political.

00:28:49
But it has a vocabulary, I think, that has been very influential.

00:28:53
According to the Satoru, society is largely shaped,

00:28:55
and I think the binary nature of it,

00:28:58
the way you phrase it has been criticized,

00:29:01
but still it has been very influential,

00:29:05
but according to the society's largely shaped

00:29:07
by tactics versus strategies,

00:29:09
or strategies for some tactics in that order perhaps,

00:29:13
with a kind of state by a large use French, right?

00:29:15
So the city puts the state very central,

00:29:18
perhaps even more so that the economy

00:29:21
devices all kinds of let's say strategy structures

00:29:23
or does of social life,

00:29:27
against which we assistance as groups,

00:29:30
although you have a relatively individual focus,

00:29:33
devise all kinds of tactics in order to resist,

00:29:36
to avoid, to intervene,

00:29:41
so all kind of creative ways of dealing with strategies,

00:29:42
and sort of turning it around

00:29:44
and doing something else with it.

00:29:47
This is the kind of literature, which, as I said,

00:29:49
the binary nature of it,

00:29:51
that this idea that there is such a thing as strategies,

00:29:54
Let's say top down strategies versus bottom up tactics

00:29:56
because that's the kind of image you see.

00:29:59
It's problematic, it's too simplistic, I think.

00:30:01
But it has very much shaped this idea

00:30:06
that we have, let's say, media, cultures, shaping,

00:30:09
shaping things, but we are also creative consumers,

00:30:13
we can actually change and creatively interpret things.

00:30:16
Does a tool gives a very urban angle to this?

00:30:19
It really talks a lot about, let's say,

00:30:20
walking in the city, for example.

00:30:24
some of the walking literature and walking.

00:30:26
There's a door, it's one of the key artists there.

00:30:27
And it really looks at the key.

00:30:29
Obviously, there's a city which has been designed

00:30:31
and structured and constructed in a certain way.

00:30:33
But we as citizens, we can walk in the city

00:30:36
and sort of adapt and use a different line,

00:30:38
a route of walking, et cetera,

00:30:42
and ways not intended by the designers.

00:30:43
So it is then leads to a kind of literature

00:30:45
and kind of reader reading,

00:30:47
which looks at tactics,

00:30:48
everyday practices, I would say,

00:30:55
practices of everyday life as situated, it's often very local, sometimes as defensive in defense,

00:31:01
yeah, in defense too, but also sometimes opportunistic. You sort of pick up on some structured

00:31:06
elements and do something else with it. So that's the kind of literature and especially kind of

00:31:12
vocabulary, which again has shaped a lot of things, this idea of, of, of, I shaped a lot of research

00:31:17
on every day of life.

00:31:19
Okay.

00:31:21
That's my first part.

00:31:25
I will just go to Quick Loop, but I see no one entering anymore because now I have pretty

00:31:29
much all chat box, not a box is open.

00:31:35
Are there any questions on this first part as a kind of first go on?

00:31:42
I see a question from Vera as James Scott, can you maybe explain this very critical

00:31:48
brief question. I don't see you so you're going to have to sort of speak up.

00:31:56
Now I was just thinking about the work of the de-structure, mission de-structure,

00:32:02
that you mentioned. And actually also James Cotely is from the same period. He published

00:32:08
the everyday life experiences of the pleasant etc. This talk about this

00:32:11
in for politics and matters stuff.

00:32:15
Absolutely, no, it's very much part of the same reasoning.

00:32:17
So one of the other books that I could have mentioned

00:32:19
perhaps, but it has been less influential

00:32:22
in urban studies, but there's a great book

00:32:25
by James Scott also seeing like the state,

00:32:29
which is basically this kind of logic.

00:32:31
It's the kind of seeing like a state you could replace

00:32:36
that with the de Satoru vocabulary of strategies.

00:32:40
and then you have citizens, people, communities,

00:32:42
these perhaps more community oriented there,

00:32:43
partially shaped I think by the

00:32:45
anthropological background,

00:32:47
which is, which divides all kinds of tactics

00:32:49
as ways of resistance.

00:32:53
Not absolutely, it's that kind of debate.

00:32:54
Yeah, good question.

00:32:58
Any other questions on this first point?

00:33:00
If so, just speak up because that's easier for me

00:33:03
than go through the whole list of people.

00:33:08
No.

00:33:10
Okay.

00:33:12
Then I'll continue with the second part.

00:33:14
Well, yep, indeed.

00:33:19
So a couple of lines of research that I'll say more contemporary.

00:33:24
So, current lines of research within urban studies that focus on urban culture.

00:33:29
Within interdisciplinary urban studies, I think here we definitely move beyond the realm of urban geography,

00:33:31
geography narrowly defined.

00:33:36
And I want to discuss with you today.

00:33:38
The reason why I spend a fair amount of attention

00:33:40
to the previous art, to the previous debates,

00:33:42
is also because as you will see in the discussion

00:33:45
that now follows, is that the kind of vocabulary that these

00:33:48
kinds of debates use are very still influenced,

00:33:50
knowingly or unknowingly, unknowingly,

00:33:53
so by the previous discussions.

00:33:56
So by both issues on the symbolic economy,

00:33:59
postmodern urbanism, informality in everyday life.

00:34:01
So that really still shapes, I think,

00:34:03
some of these current debates.

00:34:06
I will now discuss all possible directions

00:34:10
in this area of studies on urban culture.

00:34:13
If only because culture is such a, let's say,

00:34:16
slippery concept and research has really explored

00:34:19
in all kinds of directions and as let's all kinds,

00:34:21
we could say sub-disciplines,

00:34:24
or let's say certain strands of research

00:34:29
that that would be impossible to do in a two hour lecture.

00:34:32
So I've been quite, let's say,

00:34:34
so lactate in a selection has been purely based

00:34:36
on my own preferences in a sense

00:34:38
that I'm going to discuss with you

00:34:39
the number of strands of research

00:34:41
that I consider to be interesting

00:34:43
or the most interesting strands of research.

00:34:45
Obviously, I also consider to be these

00:34:48
the more to be the more productive strands of research

00:34:51
and a lot of research is being done in this kind of field.

00:34:53
The first strand of research

00:34:58
to discuss with you and again a little pause at the end of this trend is around the arts,

00:35:05
activism and urban engagement. Research on the arts, of course, there's an established tradition,

00:35:12
obviously primarily in the humanities of aesthetic analysis of the arts. So of painting, of music,

00:35:20
of theatre, mostly actually, and increasingly so differentiating into different disciplines.

00:35:23
to your left musicology, you will have tiered studies, you will have a

00:35:27
let's see art history or visual studies and those are established

00:35:30
traditions off the web histories reaching back on the years.

00:35:36
Yeah, urban studies that even as an interdisciplinary field builds on these

00:35:41
traditions but actually it's primarily used as sociological and

00:35:44
or politically economic approach towards the arts and culture.

00:35:47
So some of the elements I will discuss here, they certainly do not capture the

00:35:53
diverse, the offer, let's say research on the arts that is out there. But they do pretty

00:35:59
much capture, I think, what's out there within nervous studies. So the more social scientific

00:36:05
approach towards the arts obviously shapes the kinds of questions being asked. So one

00:36:11
result of this is that we also see through the critical focus on, let's say, the political

00:36:16
economy of the arts, we also see it in many, well, with many

00:36:20
odds, that many in many publications, an interest in the political or

00:36:23
critical potential and practice of the arts.

00:36:24
Yeah?

00:36:28
This is partially also a response to, and doesn't something I will not

00:36:31
discuss in detail here, to a relatively dominant debate on the creative

00:36:35
and cultural industries, which has really shaped the think that the

00:36:40
debate on the arts in the last 20 years, this idea that creative and

00:36:45
cultural industries contribute to, to let's see our, our contemporary knowledge economy that

00:36:50
they are a key economic sectors in, in our, in our current cities. And thus we're the strong focus on

00:36:55
economic dimensions of culture. This interest, you could say the political potential, the critical

00:37:00
potential of the arts is also partially a response to this. There are longer traditions, I will discuss

00:37:04
some of them, but this is a way of also trying to look at the creative industries the big

00:37:10
critically say okay well actually we miss out on a lot when we do not address the let's say the

00:37:17
resistant dimensions of the arts. Now the dream well there are many of course but I'm

00:37:22
summarised in here as three main lines of every research on the arts and I will discuss them

00:37:29
briefly in turn. One perhaps the most established line of research also because it ties in I think

00:37:38
with a history of research in, well, in our theory, basically, and in our history.

00:37:43
There's research on public arts and/or site-specific arts, the terms overlap.

00:37:48
A second line of research is research on artists and urban social movements,

00:37:52
the relation between artistic practice and urban social movements, and of course,

00:37:56
social movements, being established to bait within urban studies also.

00:37:59
And a third literature is literature,

00:38:02
this perhaps the most cultural studies oriented literature,

00:38:05
is literature on popular culture at urban politics.

00:38:11
So it's literature that that's increasingly engaged with,

00:38:12
with Lacy also theoretical,

00:38:14
philosophical literature on the political,

00:38:20
and how public culture plays a role in relation to urban political questions.

00:38:24
And I will discuss, of course, what I mean with the political here,

00:38:27
because it's not institutional politics per se, or if at all.

00:38:39
Now, the first line of research within this section is public art or site specific art.

00:38:46
For your readings, I added an admittedly relatively long chapter by Rosalindoyce, a New York

00:38:50
theorist or apologies for the length of the chapter.

00:38:53
But I included it because it's, well, for two reasons.

00:39:00
goes in the knowledge is a key art theorist, key cultural theorists who very early on I think

00:39:06
understood the productive connections between art theory and urban studies or geography,

00:39:15
critical geography. And erodes in the 1980s and 1990s a few foundational papers on the arts and

00:39:22
the urban. The paper here is called uneven development, public art in New York City. And basically

00:39:28
covers, I could say, a history of dealing with or engaging with public art in New York City

00:39:34
both by let's say local governments, local, the real estate developers, or let's say project

00:39:42
developers and artistic communities. I could have chosen other articles, the many other articles

00:39:48
possible. In the same book by the way, and I think I included the full book. There's also a great

00:39:57
critique the feminist critique of of Jameson and Harvey by way. I think the the chapter is called

00:40:02
Men in Space if I'm not mistaken. So basically she devices that you develop as a feminist ethnographic

00:40:08
critique of Jameson and Harvey. So I could definitely advise you to read this also. But in this

00:40:14
particular paper she basically develops a critique of the intimate utilization of public art.

00:40:19
So an emotion of the public by local governments and developers. So this idea that public

00:40:23
the way it's presented or used by local governments and developers,

00:40:25
since if it goes working more on planning,

00:40:29
in many countries you will have, if you have a kind of building scheme

00:40:31
or a local planning project,

00:40:34
a certain percentage of the budget needs to be spent on public art.

00:40:38
Now, for those who notice in most cases,

00:40:40
there is rarely a lead, in many cases,

00:40:41
there is a lot of, in most cases,

00:40:44
this does not lead to very interesting types of art.

00:40:46
It's a kind of tick the box, exercise,

00:40:48
in some cases, of course it does.

00:40:51
So she develops the critique of how public art

00:40:54
is instrumentalized in order to further,

00:40:57
you could say, the uneven development of New York City.

00:41:01
So it's shaped by elite concerns

00:41:03
and shaped by politically economic concerns.

00:41:07
So public art becomes a kind of legitimation device

00:41:10
for uneven development.

00:41:12
You should briefly refer,

00:41:13
as I mentioned here,

00:41:17
because I like the term pseudo-polar public sphere,

00:41:20
which is a critique of Alexander Klug and Anatyiris

00:41:24
on this idea of how a massian kind of ideal public sphere

00:41:26
as a field of deliberation.

00:41:29
I said, well, actually there's very little actual dialogue

00:41:31
taking place.

00:41:32
But she also hints at him.

00:41:34
This is something that, for example, Nancy Fraser

00:41:37
and other theorists later also developed

00:41:39
in more detail, perhaps, to this idea

00:41:42
of the emergent oppositional public spheres.

00:41:43
Yes, there is uneven development,

00:41:45
but it kind of sued a public sphere.

00:41:48
But we also see kind of oppositional public spheres emerging.

00:41:51
Public spheres, which on top of that,

00:41:54
have a heavy emphasis on, let's say, cultural and aesthetic dimensions.

00:41:57
So basically, often artistic communities

00:41:59
that are related to actors being engaged

00:42:03
in the design of oppositional public spheres.

00:42:04
And again, of course, this especially

00:42:06
for those interested in the arts,

00:42:07
has been a massive influence

00:42:10
in thinking to what kind of role can the arts play

00:42:13
in the urban and in urban development that much.

00:42:21
Now, here's a nice quote, a thing by adoration that summarizes, basically, this kind of

00:42:23
idea and the critique also.

00:42:29
So the idea that art cannot assume the existence of a public, but must help produce one,

00:42:35
and that the public sphere is less a physical space than a social, nullify to consider

00:42:40
a considerable extent, except that the vision is being public and non-public art.

00:42:43
potentially any exhibition venue is a public sphere

00:42:45
and conversely the location of artworks

00:42:47
outside privately owned galleries,

00:42:49
in parks and plazas,

00:42:50
were simply outdoors,

00:42:53
hardly guarantees that they will address the public.

00:42:55
Now, I'm sure that the discord prep needs

00:42:57
a bit of unpacking, right?

00:43:00
But basically what you're trying to get at here

00:43:02
is in the first sentence,

00:43:04
is that we cannot assume that by simply let's say

00:43:08
putting public art on a public square, for example,

00:43:12
We cannot assume that we automatically address the public.

00:43:15
People just don't mind not engaged with it.

00:43:17
People just that might just be there,

00:43:21
but that doesn't really make a public.

00:43:23
We can only make a public if it actually actively

00:43:25
engage with people.

00:43:28
So you actually have to construct a public.

00:43:30
And this is more than what most public arts,

00:43:32
supposedly public art achieves.

00:43:37
So this is the first question,

00:43:42
the question even the first critique she has. The second line is okay we this

00:43:45
actually leads if you think through the logical conclusions of this it means

00:43:53
that it simply putting arts in the out in the open doesn't make public art

00:43:57
but it also means that for example you can have public arts in a gallery

00:44:01
as long as you engage with the public this obviously would constitute public

00:44:09
So she critiques this distinction within much of our theory of that time that relied on this idea that

00:44:16
a critique of, let's say, modern art is that you move out of the gallery and into the public.

00:44:20
She says, "Well, actually, yes, that's a good idea, but it doesn't really make for public art per se."

00:44:26
So this is basically the kind of, let's say, dichotomy she's playing with and that are important.

00:44:31
I think to keep in mind.

00:44:36
Sure, some of the most important thing is to keep in mind to the start that we have in our

00:44:42
objects, but this art object needs actual engagement with an audience, with the public,

00:44:51
in order to become public. That's important to keep in mind here.

00:45:01
bit more concrete she has one very famous example by an equally famous artist, although not at

00:45:07
the time, I think he was still relatively young in his career at that point in time, which is

00:45:16
Richard Serra's tilted arc. This example is also discussed in the paper by Doytchen. Now, as you can

00:45:23
see on the image here, this is quite obviously an intervention in public space, right?

00:45:24
It's a massive piece of work.

00:45:32
It's a 37 meter long and 3.7 meter tall steel plates on fully square, which is in lower Manhattan,

00:45:33
New York.

00:45:34
Yeah?

00:45:41
So if anything, this is a kind of public artwork that you cannot ignore, obviously.

00:45:50
The way this according to Deutsche, the way this artwork has been sort of, let's say,

00:45:55
interpreted or let's say received, it really shows some of the problems of public art as

00:45:57
she made as she sees it.

00:46:01
Some of you could say some of the more conservative voices or sort of use of the public

00:46:09
space, have me criticize this piece of art because it blocks their way of passage, obviously,

00:46:16
If you look at the image, it completely makes impossible the usage of the public square

00:46:23
by, let's say, workers working moving from one building to the next.

00:46:28
At the same time, Deutsche Argyz, well, this doesn't necessarily make it public arts,

00:46:33
and some of the exaggerating claims made by critical, let's say, defenders of this piece

00:46:34
of work.

00:46:39
They have really focused, you could say, on assumptions as the shifts in behavior of

00:46:41
the supposed juices of this space.

00:46:46
So without actually talking to people, without actually engaging with their own interests,

00:46:50
they have assumed that the very fact that people have to sort of re-articulate their, let's

00:46:55
say, everyday practices, that they're led to a more aesthetic engagement with the public

00:46:56
space.

00:47:03
Now, according to Doris, the main problem of the discourse around this piece of art, as

00:47:07
lot of the piece of art itself, this that it relied on a very narrow aesthetic

00:47:12
reading, so ignoring actual uses of urban space to very generic

00:47:17
claims on a static uses of the square. So actually it's a kind of public art

00:47:22
intervention, which refuses to be public because it doesn't engage any sense

00:47:26
with the public. So this idea that the public involves a dialogue

00:47:30
is completely ignored in this sense. It's basically an ultimately

00:47:39
strong artist figure putting an art piece in the public square without actually becoming part and engaging with the public.

00:47:47
This piece was also removed in 1989 after years of critique but as perhaps a side note for the debate here.

00:47:59
The counter example perhaps the oppositional public sphere you can argue that the doji uses and I think this is a bit an artwork that has also been picked up by artists such as Neil Smith who also wrote a

00:48:01
to also roll a piece on this.

00:48:05
It's just of what just goes to homeless vehicle projects.

00:48:07
Also a public arts space,

00:48:09
but a different kind of animal.

00:48:11
So here in this case, a vehicle decided,

00:48:13
I had a lab by the way when looking at this picture

00:48:16
because I'm pretty sure it is the trunk tower in the back,

00:48:17
but that's something else,

00:48:22
which at that point, it's not that less of a,

00:48:25
less of symbolic value perhaps than it has now.

00:48:27
That's a different kind of animal.

00:48:32
It's also public art, also metal in many ways.

00:48:34
But here, it's a vehicle designed by artists,

00:48:36
by the artists, sorry, in singular,

00:48:39
in consultation with homeless people.

00:48:40
And it was seen in a different way.

00:48:42
It was seen as a practical tool

00:48:45
for managing everyday life of the homeless.

00:48:47
So in this thing, which you can't let the expand

00:48:53
when it's placed somewhere,

00:48:55
it was a space for washing, for sleeping,

00:48:56
but also for storage space, for example,

00:48:59
for collecting empty bottles or something.

00:49:03
So all this into one vehicle.

00:49:04
Vehicle, sorry.

00:49:07
This was both an exhibition object,

00:49:10
which was exhibited in USA Classic galleries,

00:49:12
as well as an object for actually making visible

00:49:15
the homeless in public space.

00:49:17
So I think on the basis of this example,

00:49:18
you already feel a bit,

00:49:23
the kind of different approach used towards the public

00:49:27
by this piece of work or by the previous piece,

00:49:30
by Richard Serra, because here there is an engagement

00:49:32
with specific urban users,

00:49:35
highly marginalized to use on top of this,

00:49:37
and thus, implicitly or explicitly,

00:49:40
a critique of uneven urban developments,

00:49:44
because it's a piece of work that is situated in public space

00:49:48
and makes visibly percadia effects of uneven urban developments

00:49:53
on a wider group of, let's say, urban users.

00:50:08
Okay, maybe to wrap up here on this, on this first strand of research.

00:50:14
So these are all examples of site specific art that moved art beyond the exhibition space

00:50:15
into the urban.

00:50:20
So there was a thing within art theory and art history, kind of internal critique of the

00:50:25
art world. We have to move out of the museums, out of the galleries, but also a broadening

00:50:31
or as a result of that also, a broadening of a static debate to either social concerns.

00:50:38
So this then leads to notions such as going by critically, in this case, by a health foster such

00:50:43
that the artist has a nographer, which looks at the role of the artist in the collaborative process,

00:50:47
or the artist has a participant of the reserve, so the artist has an ethnographer.

00:50:54
So the critique of foster is also, and this has been picked up in later work also,

00:50:58
is that the globalization of art market, and this is where I say different disciplinary debates

00:51:03
also become interesting, that the globalization of the art market, there's something rarely addressed

00:51:08
sufficiently, I think in other studies, leads, for example, to commissioning of artists to produce

00:51:14
community-based site-specific artworks, however, without a clear knowledge of the local context.

00:51:21
So we see that by annual logic, for example, the art festival logic, where artists are flown into

00:51:26
particular sites in order to develop community-based work, but they are adding to the community.

00:51:34
So often these are, let's say, all you superficially speaking, public works of public art.

00:51:41
And again, so much of this was foreshadowed, I think, by the work of Dolce also, but of course,

00:51:43
those others at this point in time.

00:51:51
So that's the first strand of research.

00:51:52
The second strand of research is around

00:51:54
artisan's urban social movements.

00:51:56
And of course, I'm making analytical distinction here.

00:51:58
In practice, some of these debates go over lab

00:52:00
and there are interactions.

00:52:01
But for the purpose of discussion,

00:52:04
I think it's helpful to keep them a bit separate.

00:52:05
So the second strand of research

00:52:08
tries to look at artisan urban social movements.

00:52:11
So there's a long, standing tradition obviously

00:52:14
of artists engaging in social movements,

00:52:15
but mostly those have been a research

00:52:18
I would argue outside of urban studies.

00:52:23
Again, we didn't let's say the fields specific debates

00:52:25
such as theater or such as visual studies

00:52:27
et cetera art history.

00:52:32
Within urban studies, I think most of the recent debates

00:52:35
in this area has been the only critique

00:52:36
of the creative class and creative industries

00:52:43
policies as I've already hinted at, or perhaps neoliberal or entrepreneurial urbanism more widely.

00:52:50
So what kind of role you are to play in or part of urban social movements in critiquing,

00:52:58
you could say the neoliberalization of the urban. Now there's a nice paper actually by

00:53:04
a UNist Novi and Kleakkulon, who many of you have seen attended today, who wrote a nice paper

00:53:07
We're struggling for the right to the creative city in Berlin and Hamburg.

00:53:15
I really give a nice brief, brief, but nice overview, I think, of urban social movements.

00:53:19
So it's a kind of literature which I, well, we don't really discuss the thing at our

00:53:24
social geography, that's an important literature, which moves from the history of squatting

00:53:30
and demonstrations against a renewal politics to urban counterculture.

00:53:34
then zoom in on the role of artists and cultural workers in contesting

00:53:39
color-created class and creative industry's politics. Now there's a lot that can be said about

00:53:43
this but what is interesting here of course is that automatically debate becomes you could say

00:53:48
sociological or social scientific because the moment you start looking at artists within social

00:53:52
movements you can no longer look just at their aesthetic expressions but you automatically have to

00:53:58
look at what is practically speaking their role within an often quiet heterogenous diverse

00:54:02
composition of protest movements. So we see artists collaborating with diverse

00:54:08
set of actors and that of course shapes their artistic practice. The role of

00:54:12
artists here, at least this is what no being conno highlights, I like strongly

00:54:16
I think they are definitely onto something there, is that artists to some

00:54:20
extent have a privileged role or a particular role within the urban social

00:54:24
movements because they have access to an experience with media networks and

00:54:29
and the familiarity with communication techniques. So this then leads to a discussion around the role of

00:54:36
artists in how, let's say particular urban conflicts are framed and reframes by artists in often

00:54:45
visual or other ways. And many examples you can discuss here. This is one example discussed also in

00:54:51
the article of the "Media Spake" quote "test in Berlin". For those that know Berlin, you will know

00:54:55
probably also know sort of the history a bit of media. I will not discuss this here. It's a big

00:55:02
urban development area on let's say well there's a southern part of really signed northern part

00:55:09
of Keweisbach partially which really lets us look at the counter mobilization because there's

00:55:16
also the area which is let's say a concentration of artistic and and and leisure and

00:55:18
and clubbing activity.

00:55:22
So here's a one simple example where sort of artists

00:55:25
you could say have been involved in developing

00:55:27
different, let's say, visual aesthetics.

00:55:29
And it says this basically ironically

00:55:31
builds on the B-BERLIN branding scheme.

00:55:33
So those who don't know it, just Google it.

00:55:37
And it uses the same kind of design.

00:55:39
But then changes the kind of language.

00:55:41
And sort of ironically, so instead of being

00:55:45
being creative and being a foyer, but how to translate that.

00:55:50
If I can translate that, being used and thrown away.

00:55:52
So this is a lot of viable.

00:55:54
Yeah, commodifiable is perhaps the closest.

00:55:57
Thank you, very, very good point for me and Basas,

00:55:59
but you're right, commodifiable.

00:56:01
And they replaced it by Zizamesgrystim,

00:56:04
so I saw the Dari-Zizai-Rita-Stun, so it could be self.

00:56:07
Again, difficult to try itself.

00:56:18
So, independent something on those lines, we saw the solidarity and be resistance.

00:56:20
So stop gentrification.

00:56:22
So this is one example.

00:56:28
Other examples, of course, not discussing this particular article, but from other other

00:56:34
sites, of course, this kind of artistic, let's say framing, or political and urban conflicts

00:56:38
ties in with a much much longer history of art and protest.

00:56:41
Most obviously in street art as well as graphic design.

00:56:45
So a couple of examples that are, let's say, illustrative of this,

00:56:46
but certainly not exhaustive.

00:56:50
So on the top right, you see a performance protest of an extension,

00:56:54
extension rebellion, protest in London.

00:56:58
The middle left, I think, has been quite similar to most of you

00:57:01
who think the Black Lives Matter, painted street.

00:57:03
I think this one in the Washington DC.

00:57:10
or to the bottom right, claim state, well, if they're painting, stating the

00:57:15
low to the depth repayments, street arts, intervention, and Buenos Aires.

00:57:21
And I've could have used many, many other examples, but just to give a sense of

00:57:26
the rare sort of artist play a role in urban social movements or at least a

00:57:30
protest if it's less organized than a social movement.

00:57:34
And again, this has a much, much longer history going back many, many years.

00:57:38
Some would argue since the emerged of industrialization in many ways.

00:57:43
So the last,

00:57:52
the last rant within this section that I want to discuss with you

00:57:56
is public culture nerve and politics.

00:58:00
This is, last you could say, let's, around urban social movement,

00:58:05
it also lasts around the art world as such, but more about more broader cultural expressions.

00:58:09
So here we really go back to the classical core of cultural studies that it discussed before

00:58:16
with you. So here is a focus on popular culture as in everyday life, as questioning authority,

00:58:23
but also as imagining political alternatives. So the kind of language that we then use or see,

00:58:28
use and this kind of research is that it's about politics beyond governments and politicians

00:58:33
to become the street politics as a second by the ad call that's also kind of informalization.

00:58:38
This is where the informality that turns pops up again as you see. Informalization of the state

00:58:44
as for example Julia and Boudgo as called it. Nice book by the way.

00:58:52
Again, there are many, many examples here to discuss.

00:58:55
The classic case I would argue in this field of research,

00:58:59
it is hip hop or rap music more narrowly,

00:59:00
which has been studied by now, I think,

00:59:02
by multiple multiple disciplines,

00:59:04
range from musicology, cultural studies,

00:59:06
and anthropology, but also urban studies,

00:59:08
which traditionally has focused,

00:59:11
I think, strongly on a kind of classic cultural studies,

00:59:14
community orientation, urban localities,

00:59:17
So the hood, the ghetto as classic urban teams,

00:59:20
but we also are thinking in a more critical literature,

00:59:23
has paid attention to, let's say, the way

00:59:27
hip hop culture has become, let's say commodified

00:59:31
in its globalization of its cultural form.

00:59:33
But also how it has been picked up by people

00:59:35
from outside of, let's say, the US,

00:59:40
as supposedly the source of hip hop culture.

00:59:42
So that's the classic case.

00:59:47
libraries full of books by now I think on hip-hop. Some more interesting than others, this book by

00:59:53
Marie Forman is quite an interesting example though. Similar research has also been done

00:59:58
on other genres. Typically a lot of attention has been paid to music, we see it in other fields of

01:00:02
activity, also but music has received perhaps most attention and relation to popular culture and

01:00:07
the political. A range of from clubbing culture but also to opera although the political perhaps

01:00:12
less obviously there to punct to jazz to all kinds of other cultural expressions.

01:00:25
Now what all these strands amount to is that they point to different aesthetic strategies to

01:00:32
engage the urban. Yeah, and this is something that, well, has also increasingly received attention

01:00:38
in our studies. In an article about Timon Bayes, I put a reference at the bottom of the slides.

01:00:44
He points to a number of different aesthetic strategies. As I said, as I write here,

01:00:48
they are politically distinct, but in practice, of course, they are messier. Some,

01:00:54
some, let's say, aesthetic practices might be involved in a number of things at the same time.

01:00:59
Here we said, "Okay, we basically have spectacle, grassroots, social work,

01:01:06
are rising the senses and you can automatically see it to how so many examples I've shown before

01:01:10
can be one or more of these things. So let's say for example the Black Lives Matter,

01:01:17
let's say Banner on the street so to speak, in a way you could argue this is grassroots,

01:01:22
you could argue this is also social work, you could argue it's tough somehow it also arouses

01:01:27
the consensus because it's sometimes it questions the norms of what these

01:01:32
trees are for and questions differently say media representations but quite

01:01:36
obviously it's also a spectacle because it's a really sort of traveled

01:01:41
widely and can easily be used in kind of commodification strategy almost of

01:01:45
branding almost particular cities yeah so there are all kinds of different

01:01:49
dimensions and it's in a very good question ultimately to look at concrete

01:01:55
artistic practices to look at what the different dimensions, let's say the relation to each other is.

01:02:03
Okay, that's a long stretch for one slide, but it might also be one in the longer

01:02:10
longer discussions. I'll take a short break, near for questions. So please

01:02:17
just either type them in the chat or just start unmuting and speaking if there are any questions on

01:02:22
this section. Maybe it gives me a chance to do even more.

01:02:28
Wow, that was a pre-prepared question. That was a fast or

01:02:32
unless you type very fast. So Olica Aces a question

01:02:37
or a point. I want to raise attention to your related phenomenon, where an

01:02:41
artistic, creative approach is used in part

01:02:44
of a broader participatory and redevelopment strategy.

01:02:46
Here's some sort of institutionalizing of arts

01:02:48
and their movement is happening.

01:02:51
A small quirky teams of architects, planners, activists,

01:02:52
and artists are leading the process.

01:02:56
And sure, an example, AAF and then there's a website.

01:02:57
Maybe, Olic, you can--

01:03:01
so if I understand you correctly, we won't look at the example.

01:03:05
Now, then, it's your point being that artists

01:03:08
can actually become urban developers themselves.

01:03:12
Olic it.

01:03:17
I don't see you so you have to unmute the weekend.

01:03:19
Now I see you, but your muted.

01:03:20
All right.

01:03:21
Sorry.

01:03:22
Yeah.

01:03:22
Exactly.

01:03:27
Like artists are becoming part of the planning process

01:03:27
or more.

01:03:35
I think that the low threshold approach of artistic

01:03:40
experimental, like creativeness, as being employed

01:03:45
in order to justify maybe participatory processes

01:03:48
or lead to a more inclusion of people

01:03:52
or let them participate in the first place,

01:03:57
but also just to get the people on board

01:03:59
and create some sort of tolerance.

01:04:03
So this one would be like the creative,

01:04:04
what is it called?

01:04:08
The festival of creative urban living in Milton Keynes.

01:04:12
the UK, England.

01:04:19
So yeah, it sounds like coming from a very dry urban planning

01:04:19
background.

01:04:23
This is like a weird thing to do.

01:04:25
Because people who are attending this there

01:04:27
usually not aware of the broader scope

01:04:31
of this whole development that's happening to them.

01:04:34
So that's just interesting to also take a look at.

01:04:37
It's a good addition, something that I don't explicitly

01:04:41
mentioned here, but it's a it's a neurology new trend I think, certainly something that we see

01:04:46
more and more of. I mean it was there before, but that become more visible, I think in the last

01:04:53
10 years. I would still argue though that the same kind of critical vocabulary already introduced

01:04:57
by Deutsche is also necessary for these projects, because in some of these projects and initiatives

01:05:04
at least we do see a relative instrumental or instrumentalization of artists. I.e. not the one artist is

01:05:06
is not the other artists, right?

01:05:10
So we see certain artists standing up

01:05:12
as entrepreneurs, you could say,

01:05:14
and becoming project developers

01:05:15
in relatively uncritical ways.

01:05:18
And I can name some examples also in Brussels

01:05:22
where this is happening,

01:05:26
which actually leads to a fair amount of critique

01:05:28
also within your artistic community.

01:05:32
Yeah, and I wouldn't say that this is necessarily

01:05:33
like a bad or a good thing.

01:05:41
The teams that are involved are really good teams, but it's just like always look very critical

01:05:48
because also the urban governments try sometimes to use this strategy and not in a very deceiving way.

01:05:54
Yeah, okay, excellent. Thank you. I see another comment or comment literally by VIA. Please unmute.

01:06:02
Yeah, but you already rise this critic from the Dosh, what is her name?

01:06:09
Dosh, yeah. And is also the critic from Zurkin, like this tricky fact of the art,

01:06:18
we also the vehicle of gentrification and stuff. So always super tricky to speak about the

01:06:22
art and its puttain shaw in your run and space, let's say.

01:06:27
but yeah absolutely so I'll give another example later on I think also which which raises this

01:06:34
questions and the article I mentioned by sorry I can go back I can go back. About Timon Bass

01:06:39
I also mentioned some of these ambivalences that are seemingly unavoidable so to speak there's

01:06:43
no pure space in that sense. Okay excellent and then there's Max also has a comment.

01:06:51
I just add on this point that Ulricha raised and a

01:06:57
this theme of institutionalization and instrumentation of art and artists.

01:07:02
I think Amsterdam is actually an interesting example because there is this

01:07:06
municipal policy which could be translated as the

01:07:12
breeding ground policy whereby the city assigns certain buildings as

01:07:19
available for workshops and for artists to work there and often it's also very related to

01:07:28
yeah strategy actually to gentrify a particular area I don't know whether there's any

01:07:34
research done on this plus maybe you know. It has been definitely also by the Amsterdam

01:07:37
College Law Service Strong Service Studies Research Edition at the University of Amsterdam but also

01:07:40
others. No, no, that's been critical. We should be in

01:07:42
none of it. And that one's just a particular case. It's an

01:07:45
interesting case in any case because it's it's very

01:07:47
elastic, advanced, professional and industrialization of

01:07:52
the arts, the urban level. And the bootplasm, the breeding

01:07:57
policy policy policy is yeah, it's it's striking in the way

01:08:00
it's sort of well, use and test positive side effects also,

01:08:05
but the way it little really uses the arts in in relative

01:08:10
classical urban development strategies. That's definitely true. Yeah, not a research

01:08:15
I've been known in that. Yeah. Okay, excellent. Thank you for the comments. They really

01:08:22
add some very important additional thoughts here. Other points, if not, I continue with the

01:08:31
third part of the presentation and that's the another section or direction of research on

01:08:36
on the arts or on culture and the urban.

01:08:37
This is what I would call,

01:08:39
or this is basically my label,

01:08:40
but I think it's what I would call

01:08:43
research on cultural infrastructures and informal urbanism.

01:08:45
So this is where the lesson in the literature on the informal

01:08:49
actually starts broadening to, let's say,

01:08:51
literature on informal urbanism,

01:08:52
which might be a phrase that you've come across

01:08:54
also a number of times.

01:08:57
And this overlaps the thing in recent years

01:08:58
where increasing attention has been paid

01:09:00
to let's think the infrastructure dimension

01:09:02
of urban cultures.

01:09:03
Some scholars have already talked about

01:09:04
an infrastructural term.

01:09:06
I disliked talking about terms

01:09:09
because it's very claiming a new fashion

01:09:11
and it helps to get cited more,

01:09:14
but yeah, there are so all these things built

01:09:16
on all their interests also.

01:09:18
Having said that, there is obviously more and more

01:09:21
attention being paid within our studies

01:09:23
to let's see questions of infrastructure

01:09:25
and not just narrowly defined,

01:09:27
but very diverse types of infrastructure,

01:09:29
as you will see.

01:09:31
Now, to hear one example, I think which is a good example

01:09:33
or it discussed by the team and base article

01:09:37
that I mentioned before, which you discussed in this article

01:09:42
is the work of the Chicago based RSTS targets,

01:09:43
some of you might know him,

01:09:47
where to the left you see a piece that you did

01:09:48
for the document,

01:09:57
well, not by annual, but document a five yearly festival

01:10:04
in Castell, so the document 2013, which I think was in 2012, even correct. 12 ballast for

01:10:09
Ugunot House, which basically is a restoration of an empty building in Castell using labor and

01:10:15
materials from the south side of Chicago. So it's an interesting case because it was a kind of rundown

01:10:21
building in Castell where we had, let's say, where the 30th of the case, the artist had materials,

01:10:27
but also workers moved transported, so to say, from Chicago to Castell to actually renovate the

01:10:32
stability and to actually perform in the building, et cetera.

01:10:35
So here's space and let's say the infrastructure

01:10:38
of this space really emerges a kind of social space,

01:10:40
while at the same time directing attention

01:10:43
to migrant labor and in the case of the SDK,

01:10:45
it's work and the kind of the issues

01:10:48
it engages with with black cultural expression

01:10:50
in a very particular space in Castle.

01:10:51
So there's a very, let's say,

01:10:54
concrete artistic intervention.

01:10:58
To a right, you see, let's say, in a way,

01:11:02
the reference project for the castle, the castle case,

01:11:05
which is a door chest project, the projects in Chicago,

01:11:07
which is basically you can argue,

01:11:09
and it links back, I think, to the previous,

01:11:14
well, addition raised by the Liliq,

01:11:16
but perhaps in a last, let's say,

01:11:19
planar move, and basically this is a kind of urban

01:11:22
development project led by TS to Gaze in the south side

01:11:24
which it could go.

01:11:27
Where it gets started buying up abandoned property

01:11:29
after the 2008 financial crisis

01:11:32
and has redeveloped these buildings with local communities,

01:11:36
with other artists, often creating a mix

01:11:39
of artists' spaces, of community spaces,

01:11:41
of, let's say, local restaurants,

01:11:45
or in this particular case, also a library and archive.

01:11:48
So the Dorchester project.

01:11:50
Now, what's interesting here, of course,

01:11:56
that we are still in the realm of let's say issues around urban

01:11:58
culture but we've started being more and more attention to

01:12:01
where practically literally, materially speaking,

01:12:05
are these located. So this really leads them to the material

01:12:08
infrastructure dimension of urban culture and some of what I

01:12:12
consider to be some of the more interesting, more productive line of

01:12:16
research on urban culture in the last years, as really looked at these

01:12:28
kind of infrastructure dimensions. Another pushing does a bit broader and perhaps also

01:12:36
becoming less local and is orientation towards infrastructure is a book that I added for the

01:12:43
reading for today by Brian Larkin from 2008, Signal and Noise Media Infrastructure at Urban Culture

01:12:49
Nigeria, which is for those that have rats. I don't expect you to have

01:12:54
rat the full book, but maybe maybe the introduction at least, which is an

01:12:57
anthropological study on the cultural work of media technologies.

01:13:01
There's the quote and they're rolling what in producing what we call urban

01:13:06
Africa, focusing on Kano and Muslim city in northern, Islamic city in northern

01:13:11
Nigeria. The lock-in book is interesting because it's just a very interesting

01:13:18
book but also because he flax a number of the base that are, let's say, essential in

01:13:24
research on infrastructures in general or cultural infrastructures in particular.

01:13:29
One being, it's not just about, let's say, pipes, etc. and literally infrastructure,

01:13:34
but also a lot about the symbolic or representational logic of infrastructures.

01:13:36
So what do infrastructures mean?

01:13:37
How are they interpreted?

01:13:38
How are they envisioned?

01:13:39
How are they imagined?

01:13:44
This really receives a lot of attention to think in most of the infrastructure research.

01:13:54
Also, attempts of governments to govern or control these infrastructures, it gives examples of this in the case of Nigeria.

01:14:00
At the same time, also, the unexpected or unintended consequences of infrastructure development.

01:14:04
Governments, for example, or let's say our local developers can have a plan,

01:14:12
I can't have an idea as to why do you want to develop a certain infrastructure, but it doesn't necessarily mean that infrastructure is also used in this way.

01:14:20
So here we're back a thing to perhaps do the all the discussion about strategies and tactics, but transpose to an infrastructure discussion.

01:14:22
And the last element related to this, of course,

01:14:25
is that around these infrastructures,

01:14:27
we see all kinds of informal social practices

01:14:29
in everyday life emerging,

01:14:31
which then are worthy of attention,

01:14:33
but also worthy of research.

01:14:35
So the example here I gave, for example,

01:14:38
you can easily, if I would completely imagine

01:14:42
how around these spaces, social practices emerge

01:14:44
and are developed.

01:14:46
And they would perhaps not exist

01:14:48
without these infrastructures.

01:14:49
And that's the thing, the importance

01:14:51
want to keep in mind here.

01:15:00
Nightly, exactly. It gives, and for me, the most interesting chapter in the book is perhaps

01:15:07
the last chapter, if I remember correctly, on the role of piracy in Nigeria.

01:15:14
So, the example he gives, for example, is how Nigerian video and piracy and circus of distribution

01:15:19
emerged in Nigeria and how this actually relates to a kind of a

01:15:25
perhaps which goes called a full ecosystem of cultural but also obviously economic activity

01:15:32
largely informal in the sense that it's barely regulated perhaps also illegal or

01:15:38
illegitimate or something because it's often at that point in time when you did this research

01:15:44
late 19th early 2000s often copies illegal copies of Hollywood and Indian films

01:15:48
But we're with the same incandel as in Northern Nigeria city,

01:15:53
really emerging literally as a kind of distribution hub for the wider African region.

01:15:57
Yes, so with people on the right for example, selling it on the street,

01:16:01
but also the same people of other people actually moving the goods so

01:16:06
to the speed, the material from one city to other cities, often crossing boundaries.

01:16:11
Now from the 1990s onwards, I think we've seen an increasing production also,

01:16:16
and this is the the the argument developed by Larkin of Nigerian and especially

01:16:22
housing language videos leading to a quite organized system of how is that video film production

01:16:28
but it building on the existing fire and infrastructure. Yeah so again a classic case of informal

01:16:36
urbanism a very slippery or unclear distinction between where when a something still informal when

01:16:40
when does something become formed? Because it has also become part to a certain extent of a formal

01:16:46
registered economy with some business and growing bigger and bigger. But at the same time with,

01:16:51
for example, how has the films aesthetically and organization still been shaped by you to say the

01:16:59
older pirate aesthetics and infrastructure. This is also the kind of research which has received a

01:17:03
lot of attention in recent years, which I have ever labeled here as being part of, let's say,

01:17:07
research on cultural infrastructure and informal urbanism.

01:17:19
Or to give another example of paper I wrote myself to get away with a PhD student a while ago

01:17:23
called Spaces of Open-S Urban Citizenship and Cultural Infrastructure,

01:17:28
to come alive at Istanbul, which focused in Latte in a more institutional way perhaps,

01:17:34
less ethnographic way on the institutional geography of collaboration and support to sustain

01:17:40
local cultural spaces and networks in the shadow of the states. So the argument we develop here is

01:17:45
that in a Turkey and partially also an Istanbul, increasingly being let's say shaped by kind of

01:17:52
authoritarian, semi-authoritarian state in any case, we discussed in some detail how particular

01:17:56
cultural organizations salt and depth of the North Coast as Istanbul, they might know the organizations,

01:18:00
how they act as kind of cultural infrastructures

01:18:03
of, let's say, common life or a different way

01:18:07
when we're saying, "Oh, actually public life in Istanbul,"

01:18:11
largely by actually collaborating with very many other organizations,

01:18:13
but also offering spaces.

01:18:15
And this is what the image to the right shows--

01:18:17
sorry, what this image shows--

01:18:19
offering spaces--

01:18:23
well, sorry, offering actual space in their buildings

01:18:26
to all kinds of different organizations.

01:18:31
So you see a kind of let's say hidden or semi hidden cultural infrastructure,

01:18:35
which doesn't easily show when you look at just the main cultural organizations,

01:18:39
but which really shaped you could say cultural practices in this particular city,

01:18:45
and which is only possible or in any case is made possible by the actual existence of these

01:18:54
actual spaces in the city of Solvindepo. So again, another possible, let's say, entry point,

01:19:00
inter-measage on cultural infrastructures and informal urbanism.

01:19:07
Last point perhaps for this slide, well that's not the last example, is what we see happening

01:19:08
in the research and cultural infrastructures.

01:19:13
Much of the research on urban culture is research that is most, you could say, fundamental,

01:19:19
let's say, basic, basic real academic research, but it also has a strong applied nature.

01:19:24
And the notion of infrastructure has also started, it emerged or started popping up in

01:19:30
policy documents across the world. That has many consequences, not all of them positive, but to a

01:19:37
large extent of things is an interesting development where we let's say cultural policy documents and

01:19:42
cultural actual cultural policy practices did not refer to infrastructure last say 10 years ago.

01:19:48
We see in the last five years or so we see various organizations, very local and regional governments,

01:19:53
actually using the notion of infrastructure in order to pay attention to certain, let's say,

01:20:01
infrastructure dimensions of cultural industries also. So here a few examples on the top left

01:20:06
creative city news, cultural infrastructure, an integral component of Canadian communities.

01:20:10
This is quite strong and again I think it's critique of the creative industries literature,

01:20:15
even among policymakers where we say okay we actually need a wider diversity of cultural

01:20:21
infrastructures that actually connect with our local communities, whatever that may mean but that's

01:20:26
the last 80 a game. Or for example, sustaining London as a cultural capital, why London needs

01:20:32
the cultural infrastructure plan. This again is not a strand of the debate, I think in policy

01:20:37
communities where we see because of the increasing, let's say gentrification and increasing real estate

01:20:44
price in especially global cities. Even policy makers, let's say mainstream policy has started

01:20:49
realizing that if we continue like this, we're going to have no artists left in the city. So we need

01:20:54
need to actually start thinking about the availability of cultural infrastructure in our cities

01:21:00
and to make this available literally in order to sort of keep, let's say, the status of

01:21:05
London as a global city but also as a cultural city. So why London is the cultural infrastructure

01:21:10
plan? It's similar to the bit around cultural infrastructure at New South Wales, which is

01:21:15
this mixed-setting also of the Canadian example I just mentioned and the London example of

01:21:17
available in your space.

01:21:19
Or another example in Brussels, and this is what

01:21:22
I'm partially involved in by a panamanan,

01:21:25
so permanence, the name of the association

01:21:29
pretty much sums it up, which is a practice-based research

01:21:31
I'm also now involved in where we try

01:21:33
to develop an infrastructure for permanently affordable

01:21:36
and about its social and cultural space in Brussels.

01:21:39
So basically claiming a space in Brussels,

01:21:42
which is open not just to artists,

01:21:45
but also to other types of users, such as refugees,

01:21:48
such as social housing, such as university researchers,

01:21:51
et cetera, in order to look at different models of ownership

01:21:54
also, where artists are no longer reliant

01:21:57
and are used on, I say, temporary use,

01:21:59
but they can actually, let's say, permanently,

01:22:02
literally, permanently claim space

01:22:04
through all kinds of ownership models,

01:22:06
partially building on issues around less

01:22:09
the community land trust or social co-operatives.

01:22:14
Okay, that's a lot of information.

01:22:20
Just to sum this up, if you look at the cultural infrastructure in informal urbanism literature,

01:22:23
I see at least the following analytical shifts.

01:22:28
We have moved, I think, from a concern with the informal economy, in anthropology and

01:22:34
development studies and everyday life tactics and cultural studies to informal urbanism.

01:22:36
This is the term that is perhaps the most present now.

01:22:43
It's no longer informality as such, but the phrase informal urbanism you see constantly.

01:22:46
So we've moved to a situation where, sorry, here we are.

01:22:50
And we see continued interest in labor questions,

01:22:53
social and badenness of economic relations

01:22:55
and interrelation of informal networks

01:22:56
and informal institutions.

01:22:59
So all the classic informality discussions.

01:23:02
But at the same time, we see a diversification of topics.

01:23:04
So it's no longer just about,

01:23:06
you could save informal labor markets.

01:23:09
No, it's also about DIY urbanism.

01:23:11
It's also about co-working space.

01:23:14
There's also about urela gardening, about co-housing,

01:23:16
or about artistic interventions in public space.

01:23:18
It's also about squatting.

01:23:20
There's also about self-built housing,

01:23:22
and the list is endless, yeah?

01:23:24
All these kinds of practices, of course,

01:23:28
each with their own, let's say approaches and styles.

01:23:32
You see all these kinds of practice being labeled

01:23:34
as expressions of informal urbanism.

01:23:37
There's a legitimate question to ask,

01:23:39
how useful such a slippery term is,

01:23:41
but it has certainly led to a broadening

01:23:43
of empirical interest.

01:23:47
As already mentioned before, I think the term informal

01:23:50
has really helped to move beyond a global style

01:23:52
first global north studies on cities

01:23:54
and to really look at the informal urbanism

01:23:56
as global urbanism.

01:23:58
Whether the informal in a way has become foundational

01:24:01
to our understanding of cities at large.

01:24:05
And the last point I'll skip for now is less ascension.

01:24:09
Okay, I need a set of water.

01:24:14
questions, please, or comments or additions on this part.

01:24:19
If any.

01:24:29
Maybe I could ask a question about, let's say,

01:24:31
these structures, these infrastructures

01:24:33
growing in the shadow of the state, as you have mentioned it.

01:24:37
So we noticed that actually a lot of communes in Brussels

01:24:42
are trying to set themselves on the, let's say, cultural map.

01:24:46
We are working in urban analysis on the community for her,

01:24:49
that has its own like a very active plan

01:24:52
and wants to be a leader and a new place for art

01:24:53
and culture in Brussels.

01:24:54
Yes.

01:24:58
I wonder what your take on that was also working with

01:25:00
with the association that you mentioned,

01:25:04
you must be seeing also a different side of the influence

01:25:09
of local government in Brussels on that.

01:25:10
Yeah, exactly.

01:25:11
Yeah.

01:25:15
I mean, I mean, asking a question about a city in which

01:25:16
I live, of course, is always difficult

01:25:17
because I can talk about this for hours.

01:25:22
But it's a tricky, I mean, I would say for that

01:25:26
to a logic stance has become a creative or cultural hub

01:25:29
for artists, which obviously is,

01:25:32
despite for municipality.

01:25:39
As often happens in Brussels is not because of the government that we see interesting activity happening somewhere.

01:25:44
Brussels is a city that really relies on strong, let's say,

01:25:48
well, social movements and citizen activity.

01:25:52
And there's also applies a thing to artistic activity for it.

01:25:56
Have we said that what, of course, which is now see happening is that because for there,

01:26:02
It has become, let's say, a concentration,

01:26:05
let's say, for artists, we do see, of course,

01:26:08
that local municipality is increasing also using this

01:26:11
to in a way to brand itself, right?

01:26:14
To, as such, there is nothing wrong with this.

01:26:17
I mean, I don't live in Florida,

01:26:19
we need to look into very specific local details

01:26:21
at the same time, and don't have the feeling

01:26:26
that they have a strong strategic perspective

01:26:31
on the role of arts and culture and the municipality.

01:26:33
So it doesn't, and that's applied,

01:26:38
it doesn't get to my knowledge, move beyond,

01:26:42
they kind of offering of temporary,

01:26:44
intermuse spaces for artists.

01:26:47
So it doesn't get seemed to be a kind of broader,

01:26:49
let's say more substantial perspective on this,

01:26:51
but maybe you already know more about this

01:26:52
through the human analysis

01:26:54
and the work that you've done so far.

01:27:03
I think we definitely see a lot of policy claims for sure and a lot of use of it.

01:27:08
So now indeed it's a next challenge to look into how that actually plays out on the ground

01:27:11
and whether that actually translates into action.

01:27:12
But thank you for your reaction.

01:27:13
Yes, thank you.

01:27:17
Are you a comment as well?

01:27:25
Last year I did a literature study about gentrification in Brussels, especially in the

01:27:29
region of St. John's Mullenbeck.

01:27:36
We saw in the 80s the Commodoto vartists start living there.

01:27:43
So it became very popular to live there and the results was for people, for people need

01:27:45
to move out.

01:27:52
So I guess there is always a small dark sites of this one,

01:27:56
we'll just do gentrification especially in Brussels.

01:27:59
Yeah, I mean, I can only say, in short, yes, to that.

01:28:02
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:06
Yeah, I mean, there are different opinions on gentrification

01:28:06
in Brussels.

01:28:09
I mean, some would say, well, there's

01:28:12
clear gentrification and there's expansion.

01:28:17
If you look at the numbers that might the actual expulsion of people from

01:28:22
Circle Look at these might be limited still, but it's clear that certain areas

01:28:26
are changing rapidly. One of the things we're trying to do, which for example,

01:28:29
the permanent project I'm permanent project I mentioned, is to also think

01:28:32
about spatial because one of the problems is let's say artists move into

01:28:38
certain spaces. They are looking for, let's say, work and living spaces, but in a

01:28:41
way, unintentionally so they then actually lead to a push out effect for

01:28:46
other for adolescent poor citizens in most cases.

01:28:49
At the same time, it's not as if artists are belonging

01:28:51
let's say to an urban elite in general.

01:28:55
So one of the very small level of retries

01:28:56
to do with the permanent project is also

01:29:00
to try to think of, let's say, spaces that are co-owned

01:29:05
and where let's say the move of artists into a certain area

01:29:08
does not automatically translate into the move out

01:29:09
of other citizens.

01:29:13
Realistically speaking, of course, my position on this

01:29:18
is that this can only partially be solved on a project level

01:29:21
because practically speaking, you simply need more social housing

01:29:22
for this.

01:29:24
And most of this is disastrous city

01:29:27
when it comes to percentage of social housing,

01:29:29
let alone quality of social housing.

01:29:31
We're really talking about a few percentages

01:29:36
of the total housing stock, which is social housing,

01:29:37
which is completely different, for example,

01:29:39
in a city such as Amsterdam,

01:29:41
which has also seen gentrification obviously,

01:29:44
but that's the social housing stock.

01:29:47
Definitely helps there with all his own complexities

01:29:49
and problems.

01:29:50
So yeah.

01:29:54
Any other comments?

01:29:59
No, okay.

01:30:04
Then I'll move to the last section I think of the session.

01:30:09
I think we're more or less okay on time, which is good.

01:30:13
So I did, I promised last week that I would also have a separate section on tourism.

01:30:14
I don't.

01:30:17
So I didn't manage to fit it in.

01:30:20
And it's picked up in some of these elements implicitly, I think.

01:30:23
So I'm also less of an expert on urban tourism.

01:30:28
I know the literature quite well, but it's not something that I do research on myself.

01:30:32
But this is certainly also, let's see, another strand of research, which is interesting

01:30:35
from an urban cultural perspective.

01:30:40
However, the last strand I want to discuss with you today is literature which is perhaps

01:30:46
more closely related to the humanities than some other elements that I discussed with you today,

01:30:52
which I flag here as the research on sensory urbanism, visual cultures or sensory urbanism,

01:30:57
and then two examples, visual cultures and sounds.

01:31:00
Brian Locke is text that was on your reading for today already highlighted, I think, how

01:31:06
media technologies and aesthetics shape urban places. So this idea that actually by building

01:31:11
certain distribution infrastructures, by having certain places, you actually shape urban places

01:31:17
through truly technologies and aesthetics. In term, and this you could see is, let's say, the more

01:31:23
experiential, phenomenological or our user point of view, this implies also that places are

01:31:29
experienced through multiple senses, seeing, listening, smelling, touching, tasting. Now,

01:31:32
Historically, most research has focused on the visual dimension.

01:31:34
But increasingly, we also see it, and this

01:31:35
has a long, long history.

01:31:38
I'll give a few simple examples in a minute.

01:31:39
But increasingly, we also see the attention

01:31:41
paid to other senses.

01:31:45
And I'll briefly discuss this to research, which I think

01:31:46
is pretty interesting, but obviously,

01:31:50
in bias, because I tend to like, mostly, or focus mostly

01:31:54
on music and sound myself.

01:31:56
But I'll briefly discuss some of the research

01:32:00
on the auditory culture, sonic cultures, or music and sound.

01:32:05
Now, to start with the visual culture spots,

01:32:06
so remember Jameson.

01:32:10
So this is, let's say, the hotel that we've already discussed

01:32:13
in Jameson text 1984.

01:32:16
Basically, you could say one element of,

01:32:18
if not star architecture, but at least,

01:32:21
let's see various sort of in-your-face architecture.

01:32:26
And within our studies, a lot of attention has been paid to this kind of architecture,

01:32:32
So based to buildings designed to leave a strong visual impression because that is what these buildings do and what they aim to do

01:32:36
Now the analytical focus starting already in the 1980s

01:32:42
Some elements have let's say survived the years others have not has been on cognitive disorientation

01:32:50
But also on landmark statements in a city with emphasis on spectacle and surveillance with emphasis in consumption landscapes and

01:32:53
An emphasis on represitation and global attractiveness

01:33:02
So this is all you can say well rehearse territory within urban studies and which has a long history of of analysis

01:33:05
Now star architecture you literally

01:33:09
Ads value to world cities are aspiring world cities

01:33:14
So the architecture becomes you could say an urban icon in global rankings

01:33:22
It really helps and here is it there is a tourism reference. It really helps to put world cities on the map for tourism and consumption purposes

01:33:29
these sites or the surrounding areas become sites for business investment or also for upmarket

01:33:36
Residential houses. So they literally had value to aspire the world sees true legacy strong visual claims

01:33:43
Now this has this of course has a history, right? This is not we have we should not be naive

01:33:48
Let's historically and leave and pretend that this is something of less in the post for this age

01:33:52
or something that we've only seen since the late 20th century,

01:33:54
although it probably has a increase

01:33:57
and probably, let's say, more,

01:33:59
let's say, professional and strategic attention

01:34:01
is now being a paid to, let's say,

01:34:04
the visual dimension of cities compared to the,

01:34:08
let's say, the decades before.

01:34:09
But it has the much longer history.

01:34:12
The most obvious or let's say a classic example,

01:34:14
of course, being the Eiffel Tower,

01:34:17
which itself was built to put Paris on the map

01:34:20
or to make it more visual again.

01:34:23
Part of, let's say, if a broader exhibition set up,

01:34:25
originally intended temporary,

01:34:27
but has been therefore quite some time,

01:34:30
which now is a classic landmark case in,

01:34:33
or example in, whoops sorry,

01:34:37
around the world when people think about Paris.

01:34:42
Or another example,

01:34:45
so I'm working with two computers here.

01:34:48
So this is sometimes confusing.

01:34:50
Another example, the Opera House in Sydney.

01:34:53
Again, an example, even if you've never visited Sydney,

01:34:55
you will know this building.

01:34:57
The Opera House in Sydney architect,

01:35:01
Jion-Otsan, or another example, which I think by now also

01:35:03
everyone knows, which is perhaps in a way

01:35:07
the more recent example, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,

01:35:13
Spain, which in its very setup was intended to leave

01:35:15
you could see a visual impression.

01:35:17
And you will see that many people visit the Google

01:35:21
NIMU's email bill bow without seeing anything else

01:35:23
or a very little of bill bow as such.

01:35:28
So I would dare to claim that the vast majority of people

01:35:31
that visit the Google NIMU's email bill bow

01:35:34
will leave the city without really knowing much

01:35:35
about bill bow.

01:35:37
Yeah, I mean, there's not a question if they should be.

01:35:38
It should.

01:35:40
But it's clear that this kind of visual attraction

01:35:41
plays a key role.

01:35:45
and has played at the same time in an almost role

01:35:47
in increasing tourism flows towards global.

01:35:51
Or even more recent example, the Elfilam,

01:35:56
the Afro-Hos in Hamburg, 800 million euros,

01:36:00
enormously over budget, which is very typical also

01:36:03
for someone that allowed to start architecture.

01:36:06
But in general though, and not surprising perhaps also

01:36:09
is that many of these buildings are cultural landmarks

01:36:11
that both offer you the same culture

01:36:14
and a design space for tourism and consumption.

01:36:17
So this, as I said, this is well-rehearsed territory,

01:36:20
still a lot of interesting research is being done on this,

01:36:23
but it's quite established in the base.

01:36:25
I'll give some example.

01:36:28
Of course, that leads to all kinds of discussions also

01:36:30
about who has the biggest tower,

01:36:33
I won't go into the masculine connotations

01:36:35
of building the world's tallest building,

01:36:39
but it's quite obvious here, the Gosh Khalifa,

01:36:43
And also a thing in this is perhaps a shift which is new work,

01:36:45
although also not completely new,

01:36:48
is that especially in the same world global cities,

01:36:50
such as New York, such as London,

01:36:52
we see a lot of entice being paid by private developers

01:36:56
to very upmarket elite residential housing.

01:36:59
So this is height one in London, for example.

01:37:06
It is interesting also because there's somebody's space

01:37:08
for upmarket residential housing,

01:37:10
They are built to leave a visual impact.

01:37:13
They are built to attract buyers, multi-buyers.

01:37:15
But let's say they're running jokingly or low.

01:37:17
The sadness of the story in many ways

01:37:22
is that if you look at how, for which period of the year,

01:37:24
these apartments or buildings are actually occupied

01:37:27
by actual inhabitants is often quite limited.

01:37:32
Some of these are just apartments to park, to park like money,

01:37:34
but not necessarily laundry money,

01:37:36
but not necessarily actually lived there for us

01:37:39
state is a substantial period of the year.

01:37:48
Or another example in New York for the 4-23 Park Avenue.

01:37:53
Perhaps less spectacular, but maybe in 10 in a similar direction,

01:37:58
these visually speaking, is this building at the Canal Zone,

01:38:02
the upside tower in Brussels. But the prices are certainly more affordable

01:38:06
than the word the price you will see in New York or London.

01:38:12
Now, what's interesting about this visual culture, especially in sort of new media times,

01:38:17
is that these landmark statements, these are actual buildings, these are buildings very

01:38:25
much, let's say, very costly investments in urban space. But the vast majority of people

01:38:29
will know these buildings, they will see these buildings through social media and online

01:38:35
magazines or maybe let's say a coffee-tailed book magazines. So these buildings play a massive

01:38:41
an important role in city branding and hopefully attracting cultural tourism and also in

01:38:45
circulating on social media. So you've got images such as this where as the local Instagram

01:38:52
is a search for star architecture or spectacular architecture you will see loads of images or even

01:38:59
Let's say in New York using using, let's say, certain space or new builds in New York

01:39:01
and labeling it as best Instagram spots.

01:39:06
And then you get these interesting, let's say, tourists who basically photograph themselves

01:39:12
with the building in the background as it kind of goes, let's say I've been there kind

01:39:13
of attitudes.

01:39:17
But it's quite obvious where sort of the spectacular architect plays a key role not in

01:39:19
in relation to questions actual use,

01:39:23
but Lashi and request in relation to questions of re-presentation,

01:39:24
and how can you actually,

01:39:27
how well these images look like on Instagram

01:39:29
or other websites.

01:39:35
Now, this is,

01:39:37
it's perfectly this is interesting.

01:39:39
These are new phenomena with longer histories,

01:39:40
but very interesting.

01:39:42
Theoretically, you had raised certain questions

01:39:47
about how we should look at city developments,

01:39:51
how we should look at how cities change over time.

01:39:53
This ties in, I would argue with a literature

01:39:56
on what is sometimes called geographies of circulation,

01:39:58
where we really try to understand city cultures

01:40:00
as an effect of circulation.

01:40:02
So not necessarily designed locally,

01:40:05
but actually images traveling between cities.

01:40:08
Of course, also traveling of architects and other experts,

01:40:11
but also concepts, images, plans, best practices.

01:40:13
So where urban culture as such,

01:40:15
perhaps also urban policy as such,

01:40:17
becomes a kind of practice of inter-referencing.

01:40:20
So the city's referencing each other,

01:40:22
or building's referencing each other,

01:40:26
to stake out the claim, so to speak.

01:40:28
Now, all this links back in my view,

01:40:30
although not always recognize the such within the Middle

01:40:33
United River studies, to classic cultural studies concerns

01:40:35
with the politics of representation,

01:40:37
but also to an anthropological interest.

01:40:40
And there's a very nice book and article,

01:40:43
but I am up a duet I already from the late 1980s,

01:40:45
on the social life of objects.

01:40:49
So how do objects travel true space and true time?

01:40:52
Okay.

01:40:56
Last section for today,

01:40:57
because this is our set,

01:40:58
is it's well, well,

01:41:00
it's trial and theory within nervous studies

01:41:02
to really look at the visual

01:41:04
in relation to the urban.

01:41:07
But especially, yeah, the last 10, 20 years,

01:41:09
I guess we see an increasing interest

01:41:11
also in other senses and the urban.

01:41:13
The example, I briefly want to discuss

01:41:15
which you today as a closure for the lecture,

01:41:19
isn't it this research and auditory sonic cultures

01:41:20
to vocabulary tends to differ?

01:41:25
There is a lot of interesting work being done on this still,

01:41:28
sometimes also by practicing artists,

01:41:30
practicing musicians that also write,

01:41:32
such as for example, Brandon Labell,

01:41:35
who were quite a nice book on acoustic territories,

01:41:36
sound culture, and everyday lives.

01:41:39
So you see again, everyday life returning

01:41:42
as vocabulary.

01:41:44
So in chapter three, for example,

01:41:47
which is some of the examples I use here,

01:41:49
where you explicitly build some

01:41:51
of the subtodes to practice a very alive,

01:41:54
and where we develop the view on walking,

01:41:57
not an individual way, as actually just had told

01:41:58
because he had a lot of discussions as a tool

01:42:00
about how you look in relation to building,

01:42:03
how you position yourself in relation to the city,

01:42:05
but where we develop the view in walking through

01:42:08
an auditory or rhythmic perspectives.

01:42:10
And then it gives all kinds of examples,

01:42:12
such as crosswalk signals, warning alarms,

01:42:17
or personal audio, so listening on your smartphone to music while walking through the city,

01:42:21
but also for example sound art or marching bands or protest,

01:42:28
and a role sound place in let's say experiencing and structuring, let's say city life.

01:42:35
It gives the example, for example, of Floriano Humano, Philante Sao Paulo.

01:42:38
I think he actually mentions his Rio de Janeiro, but I think it's in Sao Paulo.

01:42:45
We walked around with a big speaker on his back,

01:42:50
which basically with a voice, speaking on loud,

01:42:52
something like don't pay attention to them

01:42:54
if I remember correctly.

01:42:56
So we're walking around the streets in public space,

01:43:00
don't pay attention, don't pay attention,

01:43:03
which obviously the exact opposite will then happen,

01:43:06
which is a pretty nice or neat intervention,

01:43:12
I think in public space as a kind of art project.

01:43:15
Another example is that we have an active network.

01:43:18
And this is a much longer history, also, of field

01:43:18
records.

01:43:20
People doing field recordings.

01:43:22
There's a very nice website for those

01:43:26
that are into this stuff, which is called Sound Cities.

01:43:30
Just Google it, you'll find it, which has collected, let's say,

01:43:33
field records from cities across the world,

01:43:34
a way you can actually play-- well, it's

01:43:37
that the maps literally on the map of these cities

01:43:38
are where you can play, let's say,

01:43:41
sounds from these cities or from these particular locations

01:43:42
in these cities.

01:43:43
And that's the lesson,

01:43:44
ever growing database,

01:43:48
but there's also active community of sound recording,

01:43:51
field records, recording sounds or cities.

01:43:53
And it's quite nice if you have a bit of time

01:43:55
to, let's say, to go through some of the sounds

01:43:58
and also experience some of the, let's say,

01:44:01
differences in sounds are between, between different cities.

01:44:08
One example I want to just briefly play and I hope there's all the works with sounds.

01:44:11
I'm just going to play it and then you're going to have to tell me if you hear the sounds.

01:44:13
Turn on do turn on the sounds.

01:44:18
It's a very nice piece I think by Finn's Bloom and Mexican artist, Simba Fova-Sun

01:44:28
novel from Mexico City 2015, where we basically manipulated the walking signals of on the street

01:44:36
in Mexico City, and where we replaced the sound of a pedestrian traffic light with the

01:44:41
like, that's a classic sound, with the sound of a donkey, which according to him is a nice

01:44:46
way of well, paying attention to well. First of all, making people think differently or

01:44:50
look differently, right, this is something else than I expected, so it's a kind of intervention,

01:44:55
but also attracting attention to an animal which has largely disappeared from Mexico City,

01:45:02
Cizzies urban space which was different last say 30, 40, 50 years ago.

01:45:06
So I'm just going to look at this works and you're going to have to tell me just do it like this

01:45:08
or something if the sound is okay.

01:45:21
Do your sounds? Okay perfect, no, just kidding.

01:45:23
Good job, Good job.

(singing)

01:45:59
(crowd chattering)

01:46:27
(music)

01:46:38
Okay, so just one small example which I thought is a pretty nice intervention with a lot

01:46:39
of humor.

01:46:43
Fili's bloom also did quite, he's done a lot of work as a sound artist, he also did quite

01:46:48
some interesting work and this is kind of early work if you'd argue.

01:46:53
But where later on he actually worked in collaboration with blind people to actually and

01:46:58
let's say sounds and their experience of urban space in order to sort of make

01:47:02
artistic well artistic projects which is also some interesting work to just

01:47:06
check this website if you're interested in this kind of stuff.

01:47:12
This example I'll move to the very end which is a nice example by the way of

01:47:18
sound and protest and there are many examples of this following the 2011

01:47:21
Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.

01:47:29
Japan's are actually a wide range of public protests. Here is one example which was a sound demo

01:47:36
organized by Elus Association called Shiroto Noan, amateur revolt, and the organ as a kind of sound

01:47:42
demo protest, which is pretty neat if you like noise, which I do. But since it's a 10 minute video,

01:47:50
I will leave this for the very end and close my... Sorry, that one will come in a second.

01:47:54
and move to my conclusions.

01:47:56
Before I do so, are there any questions

01:48:00
on the section on the sensory organism?

01:48:07
And I know it's almost 8 p.m. so I know it's late.

01:48:10
Yeah, just unmute yourself and start talking

01:48:12
because I don't see anyone in my screen.

01:48:16
Okay, I would just like to share with you

01:48:18
and with me, can be interested

01:48:22
and the project of Sandoff tourism.

01:48:25
Oh, that's Mico Sanchez in Lisbon.

01:48:28
He might be the sound of tourism in the city

01:48:30
and it's pretty interesting to his staff.

01:48:32
Thanks, thanks a lot.

01:48:34
I don't know, Jia, so I'll check it out.

01:48:35
Very cool, yeah.

01:48:36
Okay, thanks.

01:48:41
Are there comments, suggestions, interventions?

01:48:43
Nope.

01:48:46
I will wrap up the new conclusions

01:48:48
and then after the conclusions,

01:48:51
I will move to the Tokyo video,

01:48:52
but there's obviously no obligation to sit

01:48:54
through 12 minutes of noise,

01:48:57
so I just leave it playing for those that are interested,

01:49:02
but I will conclude and say bye after the conclusions.

01:49:06
Okay, to wrap up this relatively intense session,

01:49:08
I think around the different strands of research

01:49:12
on urban culture, what I try to get across

01:49:15
is that research and urban cultures is a thriving

01:49:17
and more perhaps more importantly,

01:49:18
or equally important,

01:49:21
an inter-transdisciplinary field of research.

01:49:23
It's increasingly difficult to distinguish

01:49:26
between disciplines in research and urban cultures,

01:49:30
which perhaps is a trend that applies to all teams,

01:49:31
you could say,

01:49:32
but it definitely thing it applies

01:49:35
most strongly to research and urban culture.

01:49:38
Building on 1980s, '99 is the bait on the cultural term,

01:49:42
postmodernism and urban and the symbolic economy,

01:49:43
and to interaction with urban and topology

01:49:44
and cultural studies,

01:49:47
particularly to notion studies inform informality

01:49:49
and formal urbanist in every life.

01:49:51
What we see is that urban studies is really diversified

01:49:53
into multiple strands of research

01:49:55
dedicated to cultural issues.

01:49:57
It's important to make distinctions here

01:49:59
because different strands have different artists,

01:50:02
have different communities of practice.

01:50:04
But I would say there are three different strands

01:50:08
that are most interesting, but they really might do cover,

01:50:09
and they're not the only strands,

01:50:14
but I do think they cover, let's say 80% of the urban studies

01:50:19
research on urban culture, perhaps with the exception of urban tourism and cultural issues,

01:50:21
which I didn't discuss in detail today.

01:50:26
The first one being the arts, activism and urban engagement, the second cultural infrastructure

01:50:33
to inform urbanism and the third strength around sensory urbanism, a very brief, two examples

01:50:36
on visual cultures and sounds.

01:50:39
That's it from my side for today.

01:50:46
there are no further questions that I will move back to the to this presentation.

01:50:53
Sorry to this video. I have one quick question. I have one question. I have any connections

01:51:03
between Sanzuri Urbanism and Clubing Culture for instance. Limited, limited. I think it's in the

01:51:08
research is limited. I think the Clubing Culture literature as far as I know is largely

01:51:10
your literature that builds on the elastic

01:51:12
classic cultural studies tradition,

01:51:14
focusing on, let's say, youth culture,

01:51:18
popular culture, sociological approaches, by and large.

01:51:21
However, it's, if you look at, let's say,

01:51:24
practitioners in club and culture,

01:51:26
then I think there are stronger connections,

01:51:28
especially those working in, let's say,

01:51:31
electronic music, moving, let's say,

01:51:34
from a minimal techno orientation

01:51:36
who have increasingly moved into, let's say,

01:51:41
modern composition and/or indeed fieldwork type, fields with

01:51:50
course, type of work. There you will see artists who, well, sort of transcend

01:51:53
boundaries who connect these things because they then become, you could say,

01:51:57
sensory urbanists through their practice. But in the research I would say,

01:52:01
less so, they seem to be quite separate. Well, they are to a lot of

01:52:05
stand-quite separate fields. But which doesn't mean that

01:52:08
could actually cannot be made so that maybe then your job.

01:52:16
Well, I'm thinking, I have one example in mind of the

01:52:21
Tbilisi in Georgia where last year there were very big

01:52:24
protests, I have to say, I really don't know the details about it,

01:52:32
but I know there was also some substantial mobilization from clubs

01:52:38
and from people, from artists and people from that scene.

01:52:46
And you saw some sort of collaboration between these people from

01:52:52
top coaches, to say, and more political movements and also using music in public space as a form

01:52:57
of protest. Yeah, that happens, of course. I think in the Berlin example I used before,

01:53:02
I think you also see these examples of public protest and music.

01:53:05
I mean, the classic example of the love parade started.

01:53:08
How would you could say as a political movement,

01:53:13
even though I would argue it was heavily commodified soon after or increasingly so.

01:53:18
But the century urbanism literature perhaps relates more to the experimental

01:53:22
sides and to the sound, not even necessarily music.

01:53:24
And that's the different kind of scene, are you?

01:53:32
although there is overlap obviously. So yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Any other comments, questions?

01:53:39
Perhaps just a very practical question from me regarding the seminars that will follow in the coming

01:53:48
weeks. Yes. And I wonder how the presentations will go. I asked because we were asked in the past

01:53:52
to record the video of our presentation and I wondered if you wanted the same or if we will give

01:53:56
that in person. Yes, the rule would be what remained the same. I think that's how it was

01:54:00
communicated also. So I would actually need to look into the details myself because I've been busy

01:54:09
with the lectures so far. But the idea would still be that the recordings are recorded in advance,

01:54:14
and then we have the... and you was evil to me or you... and I'm represented. Yes.

01:54:17
Right, thanks.

01:54:18
So I'm sorry.

01:54:19
Sorry.

01:54:20
Okay.

01:54:21
Yeah.

01:54:22
Okay.

01:54:24
That will move to the presentation, but it's 8 p.m.

01:54:32
So this is just when I say the hardcore survivors who want to stick around for a bit longer.

01:54:33
I'm going to say goodbye in any case.

01:54:36
I will also look at it again.

01:54:38
So you can still chat if you want to.

01:54:40
And then thank you for your attention.

01:54:46
And I will see, well, I think everyone of you next week during the seminar.

01:54:47
Alright, so here we go.

# 8 Transport and cities: a historical hegemony

00:00:29
[End ---]

00:00:49
Hello, it seems that we are beginning to join this lecture today.

00:00:52
I hope you can hear me.

00:00:56
We're starting in four minutes, but I still would like to make sure that everything is working

00:00:57
here.

00:01:01
If you're not hearing me, let me know in the chat over here,

00:01:04
but I think it's usually working.

00:01:08
(key cl interval increase)

00:01:10

even

00:03:29
[ Silence ]

00:03:45
[no audio]

00:03:49
Just to check, can you all hear me and see me?

00:03:53
It's a funny question to add these days, but...

00:03:54
Yes, we can.

00:03:55
It's great.

00:03:56
Very good.

00:03:57
Very good.

00:04:03
Fantastic. I'm happy that we're not running into technical troubles right away.

00:04:11
Let's start with five past to give everybody enough time to join us.

00:04:21
So grab a drop a drink, tea or coffee or whatever it is that you'd like to drink it this time of the day.

00:04:25
And let's try to make this as pleasant an experience as possible.

00:04:32
So five moments, I'm going to switch up the video for a moment and join you.

00:04:33
Then.

00:04:43

00:07:06
[ Pause ]

00:07:07
Okay.

00:07:11
I trust that you can still see it, you can still hear me.

00:07:15
If at any point you don't, feel

00:07:16
please feel free to,

00:07:21
or yeah, please tell us or tell me in the chat,

00:07:24
which I have opened here just in case.

00:07:27
Welcome, all of you.

00:07:30
I'm sure that you've had that so many times already.

00:07:33
I really wish we could meet face to face

00:07:35
in an actual lecture room at the UB.

00:07:40
But I'm still happy that we are doing it in any case.

00:07:42
And it's very unusual.

00:07:46
Or maybe for you actually already a very normal format by now.

00:07:47
Who am I?

00:07:50
You might be wondering, my name is Voichi Kumbowski.

00:07:54
I am a postdoctoral researcher here at VUB.

00:07:56
And I'm the last of the four white males

00:07:59
to tell you everything about urban geography.

00:08:04
So I come last, but I hope this was not

00:08:08
being a very tiring cause by now and you still have the energy and then will to to follow.

00:08:17
Over the course of the next two lectures, two sessions, I'll be sharing with you my perspective,

00:08:26
my ideas about urban transport and mobility. Well, it's a lecture, so it's very difficult to make it

00:08:33
highly interactive, but I will still try to ask you some questions and I think I hope it's

00:08:39
It's possible for you to try to respond to them not only through chapter basically, you know,

00:08:43
turn the audio on video and I don't think it will be a conversation but at least it will

00:08:49
be nice to hear some other voices, not only mindful two hours and then two hours again.

00:08:51
And of course this is followed by a discussion seminar.

00:08:54
So you will have read or you have read or you have read or you have read or you have

00:08:59
read some articles and I hope you will have a discussion there so that we can make this

00:09:04
is holding a little bit more interactive than it is usually

00:09:09
the case on these online courses.

00:09:10
Right.

00:09:12
I hope you can also see the slides.

00:09:15
Can you not those of you who have the video on?

00:09:16
Do you see them?

00:09:16
Perfect.

00:09:17
Very good.

00:09:20
So excellent.

00:09:23
So urban transport and mobility, it is.

00:09:25
If you have any questions concerning the content,

00:09:28
or I don't know, the quality of video audio,

00:09:29
let me know in the chat.

00:09:34
I'll try to read this as I talk, multitasking

00:09:39
and try to interrupt me if you have any questions.

00:09:42
If you disagree, if you have some burning issue,

00:09:44
let me know and I'll let ask now

00:09:47
and then I'll try to stop and address that.

00:09:48
All right, great.

00:09:52
So what is the plan for the next two sessions?

00:09:55
Today we're going to talk about a historical hegemony

00:10:00
to different main sets of approaches to urban geography

00:10:01
of transport.

00:10:04
And next week, we're going to try to deconstruct all that

00:10:06
to address this in a critical manner

00:10:09
and to understand how to look at urban transport

00:10:12
and mobility from a critical set of perspectives.

00:10:15
So without further ado, today we're going to start

00:10:19
with a bit of a historical overview of the relationship

00:10:21
between transport and the city,

00:10:26
how this relationship evolved in at least two directions,

00:10:27
and discuss as much as possible,

00:10:29
as much as time will allow us to.

00:10:33
This historical hegemony of two main sets of approaches

00:10:36
on urban transport and geography.

00:10:38
So the classical and sustainable perspectives

00:10:39
of urban transport.

00:10:44
But before we begin,

00:10:47
I'm really curious about what your expectations might be.

00:10:50
I imagine that a lot of you in, you know,

00:10:53
starting a course of urban studies or geography

00:10:56
didn't really expect to study transport.

00:10:58
Why would the transport be important

00:11:00
for understanding cities in the geography?

00:11:02
What do you think?

00:11:05
Would anybody like to say something

00:11:07
or type it in the chat?

00:11:08
That's the moment.

00:11:10
We're gonna have a few of these open questions

00:11:13
throughout these four hours together.

00:11:15
Why study transport when studying cities?

00:11:17
Why is that important or not?

00:11:22
I did actually expect transport to be part

00:11:28
the study because to me at least it alters the way the city is structured, sometimes it's

00:11:34
structured around a specific mode of transport. There's differences between

00:11:40
they call like Harvard cities or cities more in the middle of land something and I think it

00:11:47
makes a big difference with how with a geographic air development. So to me it's actually, I think

00:11:49
I think it's a key factor.

00:11:52
Right, so we would have some impact on the urban form

00:11:55
on, I'd say, the spatial arrangement of the city.

00:11:58
Why else, there are many reasons as you can imagine,

00:12:00
but what comes to your mind?

00:12:07
I think it also like Matilda already mentioned before,

00:12:11
one main aspect is sustainability and cities

00:12:17
how to reach the climate goals.

00:12:23
So, it's linked to different transportation systems.

00:12:31
So, to think of, let's say, environmental impact of cities and transport being the big part of that.

00:12:37
Possibly, or being part of the problem, right?

00:12:45
So generating emissions, CO2 and other gases that contribute to the climate crisis.

00:12:46
All right. What else?

00:12:51
I think something has to do with JAPOP PUNTURITIES.

00:12:53
JAPOP PUNTURITIES.

00:12:59
For example, in Lagos in Nigeria, we see people moving for hours

00:13:06
to look for a job and go back again. So eight hours, they're spending in

00:13:07
in causal.

00:13:09
Right, right.

00:13:10
So transport is, well,

00:13:13
without transport is difficult to get around the city

00:13:15
and use its different functions

00:13:19
and use different opportunities

00:13:19
that the city might provide,

00:13:22
like employment, education, leisure,

00:13:24
many other things.

00:13:25
All right.

00:13:28
Any last points before you move on?

00:13:30
Does somebody have a great idea

00:13:32
to add this little discussion?

00:13:36
Well, okay.

00:13:41
Well, I think today, yes, it's quite,

00:13:45
actually, is this slide a little bit cut

00:13:46
or do you see it?

00:13:47
Yeah, I think this will be better now.

00:13:50
So today when you open the news,

00:13:52
I think it's difficult to not to notice

00:13:56
the transport is, well, very present, I would say,

00:13:57
in the public debate.

00:14:01
Last year, I'm just taking a few examples here.

00:14:06
last year, you probably read about, and maybe even participated in a witness, huge

00:14:13
protests that erupted in Chile, starting in the capital of the country, which of course

00:14:19
very much addressed fundamental structural issues in terms of how capitalism develops

00:14:23
in this country and how it has its urban or spatial impact.

00:14:28
But the beginning of the protests was so that the final even dropped that actually led

00:14:32
to the option of those strice and these operations

00:14:35
was the increase of public transport first,

00:14:37
and specifically the underground phase.

00:14:41
In Brussels, that's the top right corner.

00:14:42
We've, in the past years,

00:14:45
we witnessed a series of protests in public space

00:14:48
that address the increased presence of the car,

00:14:52
which supposedly these protests claim takes space

00:14:54
from the people, so it'll decrease the quality

00:14:55
of a new life.

00:15:02
negatively impact the quality of living, health conditions,

00:15:04
especially of children.

00:15:06
And then the figure on the top left,

00:15:11
I'm sure that you all know Greta, who

00:15:13
refers to transport, of course, she doesn't talk only

00:15:14
but transport, but she does.

00:15:16
And she makes this very political statement

00:15:19
of not traveling by plane and using one of the trains

00:15:24
to go to her meetings or conferences, at least before,

00:15:27
COVID she did, the idea there is to show us

00:15:30
that there is a necessity for us to engage

00:15:32
in some social and environmental transition

00:15:35
and transport is part of this transition.

00:15:36
So the way that we've moved around,

00:15:38
the way that we've lived,

00:15:40
is essentially unsustainable,

00:15:42
it's detrimental from the environmental point of view.

00:15:45
We need to change that radically, meaning

00:15:48
in a very drastic way.

00:15:52
So really, in a very profound way,

00:15:56
it also in terms of speed of that change in order to address what shared and devices

00:16:01
the main issue today and main problem today which is the climate crisis of the climate catastrophe

00:16:07
that is imminent. It's I think easy to yeah just by following the news to realize that well

00:16:12
something is profoundly wrong with with the way that we are mobile today and that has to change

00:16:19
and indeed the industry or the those whether the key actors in terms of producing transport

00:16:23
is there to, of course, respond with some solutions at least.

00:16:26
So we're being told that at least one of the solutions,

00:16:29
or one of the series of solutions that are available,

00:16:33
are those of platform-based economies of shared digitalised, smart,

00:16:36
gig economy-related mobility or mobility.

00:16:42
So for instance, in the future, living in the city,

00:16:43
we don't have to have a car.

00:16:45
It says, you know, the tremendous demand,

00:16:47
we can rent one through an app.

00:16:53
We can drive electric cars which are readily available in public space in our cities. We can use one of these

00:16:56
electric scooters and many other modes of transport that have

00:17:02
boomed in recent years in many many cities of the global north especially but also in global south.

00:17:06
And Brussels, I'm sure those of you who are from the city of

00:17:11
being there for a couple of months now. You know you can observe many of these different

00:17:18
practices of mobility, very present in the city, and some of them at least being part of a

00:17:24
narrative of some change, of some future, of something that is shaping the way that we live and move

00:17:31
around the city. From a more scientific perspective, one answer why to the question why is that

00:17:38
the transport? Is that quite simply? And I think actually the very first sentence of one of the most

00:17:42
seminal textbooks on transcription of transport geography.

00:17:44
There wouldn't be no transportation without geography,

00:17:45
and there would be no transportation,

00:17:48
no trajectory without transportation.

00:17:52
Transport of transportation in North America

00:17:54
is an essential geographical issue.

00:17:57
The idea is, and again, it's the same textbook,

00:18:00
that transport allows to reduce the distance to zero, of course.

00:18:03
That reduction never really happens, but the idea is

00:18:06
the transport allows to annihilate space and time

00:18:11
that is required to conquer, to cover that space.

00:18:16
But I think beyond that very dry definition

00:18:18
of the relationship between the two,

00:18:20
what's quite important is that, well,

00:18:23
it's very hard to imagine not only contemporary,

00:18:27
but also pre-modern ancient societies without movement

00:18:29
without transport.

00:18:31
It's something that has always been fundamental

00:18:33
for human societies for human settlements.

00:18:35
And today, and that's something that I will try

00:18:37
to show you in these two lectures

00:18:41
and in the discussion that will follow the week after.

00:18:44
Transport is absolutely fundamental for studying the city.

00:18:45
And I think it's a fascinating entry

00:18:47
for studying what cities are today,

00:18:50
what problems might be found in the not only

00:18:52
transport problems, but social problems,

00:18:54
spatial problems, economic problems related

00:18:57
to all different challenges that at first,

00:19:00
at least do not seem to be transport related.

00:19:04
So in fact, they are being negotiated, articulated,

00:19:07
contested, solved sometimes, but more often

00:19:11
unfortunately created through the production

00:19:13
and distribution of transport.

00:19:16
So we will try to impact this relationship

00:19:18
starting by, let's say,

00:19:20
more of a historical analysis.

00:19:22
So I'll start in mid-19th century

00:19:24
in Sootheesen, Western Europe

00:19:28
in what we can identify and pre-industrial era.

00:19:33
And we will bring that analysis to the 1960s, 1970s.

00:19:38
Let's see how much time we've got for this today too.

00:19:41
Well, let's say the beginning of a major crisis

00:19:45
that formed or framed the debate in a way

00:19:47
that it is being framed still today.

00:19:51
So some kind of a setting of a contemporary challenge

00:19:54
or series of contemporary challenges related

00:19:56
to transport and mobility.

00:19:58
So all right.

00:20:03
So the main point here--

00:20:06
I don't want to spend too much time on this historical part

00:20:08
because I don't think this is the, well,

00:20:12
it's not contemporary, so perhaps it's not as interesting

00:20:15
as as many challenges that are happening right now.

00:20:17
The main point here is that urban transport systems

00:20:20
are a very strong and strictly related

00:20:22
with urban form and with a spatial structure.

00:20:24
So the development of cities is conditioned

00:20:27
by the development of what we call transport modes

00:20:30
from walking, so just walking on foot,

00:20:33
to the bicycle, the public transport, and to the car.

00:20:37
And there is a persistently strong relationship

00:20:39
between the intra-urban transportation system

00:20:41
and the organization of the metropolis

00:20:44
as Miller, who wrote one of the most seminal,

00:20:48
again, textbooks on the history of transport geography,

00:20:49
tells us.

00:20:50
And there is a variety of different urban forms

00:20:53
and spatial structures and land use patterns

00:20:56
which are related specifically or very closely

00:20:59
to the development of different transport norms.

00:21:05
And as far as I understand, you've covered quite a few of the most important models of development,

00:21:09
urban development throughout history with Nick.

00:21:15
You can not hear if that's the case and deny the fact if you didn't.

00:21:18
But I think that this was covered at some point.

00:21:23
And the idea here is that in a lot of these models, although not explicitly mentioned,

00:21:25
transport was actually absolutely crucial.

00:21:29
So the idea was both the adjacent unknowns and movement

00:21:32
and mills mentioned that without the development

00:21:34
of different voices moving around the city,

00:21:37
the development of which of course to an extent

00:21:40
erroneously they tried to model or predict

00:21:42
would not be able to happen.

00:21:48
Well, the debate has been there in the

00:21:52
in transport geography until the 1970s, 1980s,

00:21:57
how to model that relationship, how to analyze it,

00:22:01
whether in fact it's more the development of a decision

00:22:03
that drives the development of transport

00:22:05
or the other around with its development

00:22:06
of different transport modes,

00:22:08
that drive the development of the city.

00:22:10
It's not a particularly interesting debate today,

00:22:12
but it's important to acknowledge that geographers

00:22:14
were very early on,

00:22:18
urban geographers interested in the development of mobility.

00:22:22
One, also rather imperfect and symbolic rather than

00:22:26
analytical way of describing this is through identifying

00:22:27
some cycles of innovation.

00:22:31
So looking at different scientific developments

00:22:34
come-- well, some scientists would say

00:22:37
in these kind of crucial moments.

00:22:40
There's a bundle of different innovations coming together.

00:22:44
So at the end of the 18th century, as you can see at the left

00:22:48
inside of the graph, the invention of water power textiles

00:22:51
iron than some 60, 70 years later,

00:22:54
the steam engine rail, production of steel,

00:22:55
et cetera, et cetera.

00:22:58
Each of these bundle of innovations

00:23:02
allowing to, of course, create a more efficient

00:23:05
that you can be faster and more energy efficient

00:23:08
way of moving, of course, not only within,

00:23:11
but also between cities, changing not only the way

00:23:15
that people move, but also the way that the city itself

00:23:19
could be organized in space.

00:23:20
And in this sense, we could,

00:23:24
although of course this is not a perfect robust typology,

00:23:28
but we could come into some kind of agreement.

00:23:29
You don't have to accept it,

00:23:32
and I'm happy if you erase some issues with it.

00:23:35
But we could divide the development of the city

00:23:36
around the development of transport

00:23:40
by identifying four different stages,

00:23:41
I wouldn't call them errors,

00:23:43
but a city that is a pre-industrial city

00:23:46
that largely was based on walking,

00:23:51
since more motorized transport was generally speaking,

00:23:53
not that it was just not there

00:23:56
and having a horse would be an extremely expensive

00:23:58
investment, which means people walked.

00:24:03
And industrial city, which developed around the birth

00:24:06
of what we could identify today as public transport,

00:24:10
first horse driven carts and then motorized ones,

00:24:14
Then the Ford is city which very much developed around the,

00:24:15
not only in the invention, but rather the

00:24:18
classification and the finalization of private vehicles

00:24:19
and private cars.

00:24:20
And then a city of today, the post-F

00:24:26
is city which very much fails on the development of

00:24:29
transport modes that use the ICT information

00:24:33
and information and communication technologies.

00:24:37
And of course aviation, so the city does,

00:24:40
is very much related also to the development of all

00:24:47
typology of spaces related to flying to airplanes, both passenger and cargo transport.

00:24:54
Are there any questions at this stage before we dive into these different four stages?

00:24:58
I don't hear anything. Yeah, yeah. How to go ahead.

00:25:08
The draw we see is linked to a conradive because we saw something like this.

00:25:12
with lessons of Nick?

00:25:13
Yeah, I would say so.

00:25:16
I think that it's one of the ways of,

00:25:20
I wouldn't say that it's specific,

00:25:22
yeah, that it's completely matches conductance ways,

00:25:24
but the idea is the same,

00:25:27
that there is some kind of development of innovation

00:25:29
within the capitalist system,

00:25:31
which allows to gain some competitive advantage

00:25:35
which allows to create some kind of growth machine,

00:25:37
and then is competitive advantage over time

00:25:42
is lost so that we have to decline until it picks up again.

00:25:47
What I think with contract is still not clear is whether this new wave,

00:25:51
so the one that here in this graph happens after the 1990s, it's very clear.

00:25:54
So as far as I understand, although I'm not especially here,

00:25:58
there is a discussion whether this new wave is with the digitalization

00:26:01
and software engineering is actually materializing,

00:26:04
or whether we've arrived at a global system,

00:26:11
which there is no growth of, at least within industrial production,

00:26:14
but it's rather a financial, financialized growth.

00:26:20
But it's a good, let's say it's a good hand,

00:26:23
it's the idea is more or less the same, the same intuition.

00:26:29
Also, the problem with this clearly is that it's not, I mean,

00:26:34
this kind of way of trying to understand what happened in cities around transport in the past,

00:26:39
two centuries is extremely Western focused or very Eurocentric.

00:26:47
So this would not be a story of cities in most of Latin America, Africa, and South Asia,

00:26:55
and also post-Soviet or Soviet world. So the global south and the global east, as it's

00:27:02
sometimes even called today, it's not really part of this story that is told by this graph.

00:27:09
We will try to address this, but it's, yeah, it's, that will happen at the very end of the last

00:27:14
of the last session to try to decolonize a little bit our knowledge about transport geography

00:27:18
because it's extremely westernized and extremely for a Eurocentric.

00:27:21
Right, let's dive into that.

00:27:26
Right, so the pre-industrial city, right?

00:27:32
Well, I guess it's quite self explanatory. It's not very difficult to understand.

00:27:36
And indeed, the idea is that the city basically is, well,

00:27:38
since there is no motorized transport modes

00:27:42
and having, as I mentioned, having a horse or a horse car,

00:27:44
it's a cost of fortune.

00:27:50
It's an absolutely luxurious good, pretty much everybody

00:27:50
walks.

00:27:55
And since everybody walks, the city cannot be too big for people

00:28:01
to cross it on foot within more than 20, 30, maybe 40 minutes.

00:28:06
So a traditional global northern European city would have,

00:28:10
until, let's say, end of the 18th century,

00:28:13
no more than five kilometers in diameter.

00:28:16
That would mean, of course, here, for example,

00:28:19
you have the map of Brussels from that time.

00:28:21
That would mean that within the city walls,

00:28:25
which existed for military purposes, for defense,

00:28:27
there had to be a very high density

00:28:30
of different functions of different users.

00:28:35
And for other reasons that we know how to dive into today,

00:28:38
a grid street pattern was also very common

00:28:40
from middle ages onwards.

00:28:43
Also very importantly, since these, well,

00:28:45
not maybe since, but as these different functions

00:28:50
were mixed, maybe this mixity was allowed partially

00:28:52
also because of the fact that the division between work

00:28:55
at home, a division that is absolutely fundamental

00:28:58
for a lot of writing on transport geography

00:29:01
that focuses on that morning and evening commute

00:29:04
from home to work and work from home.

00:29:05
That did not exist.

00:29:07
Most people worked from home.

00:29:11
Most people did not have to move to reach.

00:29:14
We can say they implement the employment

00:29:16
that they had or to engage in some kind of productive activity

00:29:21
that would be remunerated to gain some kind of salary

00:29:24
or profit.

00:29:26
Things-- and this is all Brussels first.

00:29:32
Brussels, the map of it, and then a view of the city center where you obviously, well,

00:29:38
you basically see a lot of pedestrians and not much else in terms of mobility modes.

00:29:44
This began to change with a series of inventions. First, a steam engine, an electric engine,

00:29:52
both, well, the invention started at the end of 18th century and moved also to the 19th

00:29:56
century, then the bicycle, I'm moving very fast in time,

00:30:01
and the bicycle was invented in the '60s of the 19th century.

00:30:04
I think, 1867 more or less.

00:30:06
Of course, all these inventions first

00:30:10
being curiosity, again, very luxurious goods,

00:30:13
bicycle being something that was much more used first

00:30:16
as a form of pleasure before eventually becoming

00:30:20
a mode of transport for many workers.

00:30:24
although it meant is that they gradually led to mechanization

00:30:27
of land transport systems.

00:30:34
And we see that gradually happening here.

00:30:37
So these different inventions,

00:30:39
particularly steam engine and nature also,

00:30:43
the discovery and discovery of the machines

00:30:48
that allow to produce electricity meant that

00:30:50
towards the end of the 19th century,

00:30:53
it appears a completely different mode of transport,

00:30:55
which revolutionizes cities of the time,

00:30:58
which is that of first a host around streetcar

00:31:01
and an electric streetcar,

00:31:04
which started to be introduced in European,

00:31:07
Western European cities, around 1890s,

00:31:10
and then became extremely popular by the 1920s.

00:31:15
That led to, well, we moved to this second state,

00:31:17
let's say, to the industrial city,

00:31:23
Let's do a huge revolution of how cities could be conquered by its inhabitants,

00:31:26
how they could be managed, navigated by its inhabitants.

00:31:37
That also allowed, or led to the decision to engage in construction of a number of underground

00:31:40
tramways, as they went for a school, the land of the ground systems first,

00:31:46
in London in Asia, early as 1863, then Budapest in 1896,

00:31:51
and the first Northern American system in Boston in 1897.

00:31:55
And that marked the beginning of, as I said,

00:31:57
a revolutionary change in a golden era

00:32:00
of the development of railway transport systems.

00:32:03
As railway networks expanded tremendously

00:32:04
and became the dominant land transport

00:32:06
for both passengers and for freight.

00:32:09
And that was valid or is valid

00:32:13
for both interurban and intraurban transport.

00:32:16
Why was this invention revolutionary?

00:32:19
Well, of course, because increased speed

00:32:21
allowed to cover increased distance.

00:32:25
So suddenly, for instance, the idea of still living

00:32:28
within the very medieval perimeter of the city

00:32:31
was or started to be questioned.

00:32:33
It's the idea of expanding the city to the suburb

00:32:37
or connecting the villages and the suburbs

00:32:41
to the city proper began to make a lot of sense.

00:32:45
So that led was one at least one of the ideas

00:32:48
why in a number of cities across Europe,

00:32:51
city walls were demolished.

00:32:55
And we see that here in Brussels.

00:32:57
So first, horse, drone, cart.

00:33:01
I think it's a photograph from the 1890s.

00:33:05
So end of the 19th century and 1910,

00:33:07
I think it's a green whale in Brussels, you already see.

00:33:13
I think that's, is that a horse, really in trumbly.

00:33:15
I think it actually is already, it's an electric one,

00:33:16
although I don't see the cables.

00:33:19
I thought it was an electric, but I think it might still be

00:33:23
pulled by a horse, although you don't see that from,

00:33:25
well, the trander is heading in our direction,

00:33:28
does not have a horse pulling it.

00:33:31
Right.

00:33:35
So I already mentioned this in a little bit.

00:33:40
So a revolution in urban travel, a breaking mode

00:33:45
that allowed to rethink the air reform,

00:33:48
made an impact on it in a great way.

00:33:50
Breaking this idea of a compact, dense,

00:33:54
medieval city, allowing to extend what was considered

00:33:58
to be a city to up to 20 or 30 kilometers in time,

00:34:00
if you think that the previous,

00:34:03
let's say model of a city had up to five,

00:34:08
This was an expansion of four to six times.

00:34:13
But also a PS in this process.

00:34:15
Of course, it's not all related to transport,

00:34:16
but it's happening more or less the same time.

00:34:20
And it makes a big impact on what transport is

00:34:22
in the city and what it role is,

00:34:25
is that this expansion of the urban form in space

00:34:28
allows for some specialisation of different functions,

00:34:29
especially economic functions.

00:34:31
And what it also creates,

00:34:33
or contributes to the creation of,

00:34:35
is the creation of a working class,

00:34:38
the Office of a specific group,

00:34:40
a social group of course, very diverse internally,

00:34:45
but a group that sells its time for a living,

00:34:48
that of course with the industrial revolution,

00:34:50
does that not in any more at home,

00:34:53
but actually starts what we start coming,

00:34:56
commuting to its workplace,

00:35:00
where things have been produced

00:35:07
the profit is being made and where the salary work is exchanged for money for a salary.

00:35:15
That separation, as I mentioned, being absolutely fundamental for decades of analysis of transport

00:35:23
to come. So, focus on this commute from work to home and vice versa. Moving to the next,

00:35:30
something, good to see you. Moving to the next stage of urban development, you can put it

00:35:37
very roughly. Of course a fundamental invention of the car, not only the invention of the car

00:35:44
proper because the vehicle itself, I mean we can go back to the first diesel engine invented

00:35:49
in the 90s of the 19th century, pheumatic tyre, four stroke engine, and a few years later,

00:35:55
and that led to the construction of the first automobile, as they were called back then in the

00:36:00
in the 1890s, but it was fundamentally the

00:36:05
classification of the current invention of this particular model,

00:36:07
which I'm sure you've--

00:36:08
or a lot of you probably have heard about already--

00:36:13
the model T by Ford, which began to be produced in 1913.

00:36:17
And famously, Mr. Ford said that this model is available

00:36:20
in any color as long as it is black.

00:36:23
The idea being that with unification of--

00:36:31
universalization of the model, getting rid of any options of any customization of any personalization.

00:36:42
And also, the implementation of today is being called Taylorism. So reaching a near automated

00:36:47
way of producing this vehicle with very strictly measured time for every single activity that

00:36:51
that was part of the production process.

00:36:55
The final price of the production and the final price for the consumer

00:36:56
could be reduced as much as possible,

00:36:59
meaning that this product, this commodity,

00:37:03
could be available to white masses.

00:37:07
And that does begin from the 1910s already,

00:37:11
but especially from the 1930s, when indeed the price started going

00:37:15
significantly down, the era of the automobile,

00:37:18
the era of a mode which I'm sure that if you

00:37:23
know, turn on the news about Brussels or any other Western European North American city,

00:37:29
but that debate also is very, very present in Minneapolis, Latin America and South Asian

00:37:34
cities. It's a mode that is very much on the agenda whenever you talk about, whenever

00:37:41
you hear about transport. And we're going to talk about that, I guess, tonight, if not,

00:37:47
in a week is a very well, is a very present mode of transport in our cities and also very

00:37:53
problematic mode of transport in the tracks, a lot of constipation, a lot of anger, and

00:37:59
a lot of creative and critical thinking in terms of what's the alternative to the automobile.

00:38:03
So it's been almost a century now that our cities, if we think about it from the global

00:38:10
north, are, I don't know, benefiting or suffering from that, from that long, you tell me.

00:38:17
from 1913 to 1927 Ford managed to build 15 million units, 15 million

00:38:21
vehicles, making it the second most produced current history right after

00:38:26
Volkswagen Beetle, which was also, they began the production a little bit later,

00:38:33
but also ended period between the first and second world war. So why, well,

00:38:38
this we've covered already mostly, but well, the most important thing here is

00:38:40
in the last bullet points.

00:38:43
I mean, why is the car such a revolutionary

00:38:45
and such an important mode of transport

00:38:46
to be mentioned here,

00:38:49
is that for the very first time mobility,

00:38:53
motorized mobility is an individual exercise.

00:38:57
It's no longer only a motorized or a horse-drawn street

00:39:01
car that allows you to cover long distances

00:39:03
of taking a train, a suburban train

00:39:05
that takes you to the factory and back.

00:39:07
But it is an individual vehicle,

00:39:14
an individual product that allows you to reach unprecedented levels of individual mobility.

00:39:23
And of course, that immediately had a very important impact on the way that the cities are planned and imagined.

00:39:36
Well, without running the risk of maybe a little bit of drawing some kind of caricature,

00:39:44
This impact starting from especially the Second World War when it was a very strong narrative

00:39:50
of the need of modernizing cities, especially in North America and Western Europe.

00:40:00
A lot of cities became basically a perfect space for driving around a space in which huge

00:40:06
amounts of infrastructure for this individual car base mobility was built.

00:40:11
This process started a little bit early in the US and the 1940s and 50s already and after

00:40:16
the Second World War, that narrative was started to be very present in Western European

00:40:17
specifics.

00:40:23
Both of these images, by the way, come from a really wonderful film by Jacques T. I believe

00:40:27
is called Playtime from the 1967, which I really recommend.

00:40:32
He watches a great critique of this idea, this framing of modernity, which also very much

00:40:37
changes on the idea of having a car of driving around.

00:40:43
And well, moving to more serious stuff,

00:40:45
I mean, accommodating the car in a city meant

00:40:50
that serious infrastructure had to be built.

00:40:53
A serious self had to happen in cities at the time

00:40:56
for the car to receive this kind of space.

00:41:01
Some of the most important projects happen in the US,

00:41:03
As I mentioned on the left hand side,

00:41:06
you've got the Franklin Delano-Rousville Drive

00:41:08
and open in 1966 in New York.

00:41:10
On the right hand side,

00:41:11
the infamous Pont de Morandean,

00:41:13
and you know, in Italy 1967,

00:41:16
which unfortunately collapsed,

00:41:18
I believe, two years ago,

00:41:20
which also symbolized, of course,

00:41:22
it's a terrible event,

00:41:24
but for many,

00:41:26
it was a very powerful symbol

00:41:27
of this infrastructure crumbling

00:41:30
and an important question of what to do

00:41:35
with these relics of modernity or past modernity,

00:41:40
whether they should be, in this case, rebuilt or maintained

00:41:42
or invested in, whether this is something

00:41:44
that we want to graduate dismantle

00:41:48
and stop subsidize his maintenance of these infrastructures

00:41:51
is undoubtedly very costly.

00:41:56
And the next slide, does anybody have a clue

00:41:58
where this city is?

00:42:02
Chalua. - Very good.

00:42:04
Well done, yes, this is the...

00:42:09
I don't remember the name of the road, but...

00:42:12
Yeah, yeah, it's in the next slide, so I'm so silly.

00:42:14
I mean, Bez is our nine built in 90,

00:42:15
or opened in 1976.

00:42:18
I don't know if you ever had the experience of driving this,

00:42:20
but it's really a time-canny.

00:42:25
It makes me personally feel as if I was in some Chinese

00:42:27
or other Asian city where you were here.

00:42:32
on this elevated platform, almost gliding through the city.

00:42:34
So it's really one of the, I think,

00:42:36
most extreme or more extreme cases,

00:42:38
at least in this part of Europe,

00:42:42
of really plowing through a city

00:42:46
to build this motorway ring route.

00:42:49
But Charlie, wow, it was not the only one.

00:42:50
I mean, we are, after all,

00:42:52
or I don't know where you are right now,

00:42:54
but most of us are in Brussels right now.

00:42:56
And Brussels was definitely also a playground

00:42:59
for many of these ideas.

00:43:01
And the idea of bringing the car and opening the city

00:43:04
to the car, like in American cities,

00:43:06
at least that was the comparison use in Belgium,

00:43:08
became particularly strong

00:43:13
and particularly potent among the political class

00:43:16
that decision makers around 1958.

00:43:18
What happened in 1958?

00:43:20
I guess you've heard that date before.

00:43:23
Any non-belgence?

00:43:26
1958, why is that important for Brussels?

00:43:28
The X-word, the X-word.

00:43:29
That tell me.

00:43:30
The Atomium.

00:43:33
And why would the Atomium be, well, okay,

00:43:35
the World X-flow, symbolized by the Atomium,

00:43:37
and why would that be related to the car?

00:43:47
You really don't have any ideas?

00:43:49
I mean, if you're opening a World X-flow

00:43:52
for the very first time in Belgium and inviting,

00:43:54
I don't remember how many people actually visited

00:43:55
the X-plain at the end,

00:44:00
millions of people visited the city. Why would Car be important?

00:44:02
Would the Car be important in that regard?

00:44:08
For putting Buzzum on the map?

00:44:10
It's worth it, Buzzum on the map.

00:44:14
The connection to go into it.

00:44:15
It's also the message.

00:44:21
It's to serve the idea of, I mean, not the idea, the problem of congestion is to bring

00:44:26
these masses to the Expo and back is to allow for a better communication but also to put

00:44:32
Belgium on the map to show that Belgium is a modern country. To show that it's on you know cutting

00:44:38
edge and being cutting edge in 1958 in Belgium meant opening the city for the car and building

00:44:44
huge infrastructure or started least to build huge infrastructure that would accommodate this new

00:44:51
modern US-like American way of mobility or moving around the city.

00:45:00
So yeah, some things that are quite unthinkable today, we're going on at that time.

00:45:08
So this is Gaborne Plus, I think it's in the 1960s. So of course, Expo was a symbolic event.

00:45:13
And it didn't really, it was not just tipping points.

00:45:16
There were a lot of dynamics happening in the time

00:45:19
and the export was maybe more of a symbolic moment.

00:45:22
But it is around the time that the level of authorization

00:45:26
at the level of ownership of cars in Belgian households

00:45:29
and similar processes are mentioning Belgium here,

00:45:30
but similar things were going on in France

00:45:33
in Germany in the UK.

00:45:34
It went through the roof.

00:45:40
So it was very, very common back then

00:45:44
to invest in the car as a symbol of advancing

00:45:46
as a household as a symbol of social mobility,

00:45:49
not only a physical geograph,

00:45:51
but that of course meant that more and more space

00:45:52
had to be given to the car

00:45:54
and as the car became more present,

00:45:55
more people pulled the car.

00:45:58
So the circle was closed and there was a vicious one.

00:46:01
In Brussels specifically,

00:46:03
well, one of the most important interest structures

00:46:05
built the time is the Petit Santu,

00:46:09
so the ring road that surrounds the Pentagon of the city.

00:46:12
I'm sure that you've all been there.

00:46:12
So essentially,

00:46:17
the framing of it,

00:46:20
right, the actual shape of the Pentagon comes

00:46:22
from the city walls,

00:46:25
the second walls of Brussels coming from the 14th century,

00:46:26
completely destroyed,

00:46:29
which defined it as the re-center of the city still.

00:46:30
And until the 1950s,

00:46:32
it was very much an urban bulldog

00:46:37
which one could stroll and walk very much like in the drawings rather than photographs that I

00:46:42
showed you at the beginning from the city of walking city that was very much defined by the

00:46:52
pedestrian mode of moving around. In relation to the 1958s, I had to be gradually transformed.

00:46:59
So a series of first tunnels were built and the surface was raised to open to the car.

00:47:03
It took 20 years of work, which is not a very unusual thing in Brussels to do.

00:47:07
So two decades of extremely heavy work and very destructive work,

00:47:10
whole neighborhoods had to be relocated, destroyed, rebuilt.

00:47:16
So opened in 1976 with 15 tunnels surrounding the city.

00:47:21
Also quite importantly, and that's maybe a bit of an extreme story that

00:47:24
not necessarily happened also in France or in Germany or another,

00:47:25
Western European cities.

00:47:30
But what was very crucial in rehearsals is that the engineering team,

00:47:32
so the engineering officers, consultancy officers,

00:47:37
we call them today, would receive personal bonus on top of the salary

00:47:40
for every kilometer of an underground tunnel built.

00:47:48
So that led to creation of a huge push to build underground infrastructure for mobility,

00:47:52
both for cars, but also for railroad and metro.

00:47:55
And that led to a creation of very important expertise

00:47:57
in building these underground tunnels,

00:48:00
which of course, once you have that expertise,

00:48:02
you of course want to keep building more

00:48:05
because that's what you are very good at doing.

00:48:07
And that problem in Brussels,

00:48:10
well, problem situation exists until today

00:48:12
where we have huge teams of engineering,

00:48:16
specialists who specialize in building underground,

00:48:18
in steep and about the transport company in Brussels.

00:48:20
Half of the company is responsible

00:48:23
for metro for its maintenance and construction.

00:48:25
So you can imagine that what you want to do,

00:48:28
of course, is to keep building a metro,

00:48:30
which is what they are currently doing in Brussels.

00:48:35
Moving a little bit or zooming out a little bit from cities,

00:48:39
the large scale diffusion of the car

00:48:42
or the automobile as a mass consumption project,

00:48:45
of course, was strongly also influenced

00:48:49
or maybe also led to a dynamic,

00:48:52
to the emergence of first nationwide highway systems.

00:48:57
The first one created was of course the one in the US.

00:48:58
The American interstate highway system,

00:49:02
which began to be not many completely built from scratch,

00:49:07
but the first framing of it and continuous gradual addition

00:49:11
to the network in 1956.

00:49:15
Which was, of course, back then that symbol of modernity,

00:49:20
that in many other places, Belgium being one of them

00:49:23
influenced the definition of the idea

00:49:25
of what was modern or was cutting edge wars,

00:49:28
technologically advanced.

00:49:32
Today, of course, it's not the US anymore

00:49:35
that it's leading country or the leading power

00:49:37
in terms of the development of transport, technology,

00:49:40
and highways in particular.

00:49:42
That system that American system has been

00:49:46
by now surpassed definitely by the one in China.

00:49:48
The national trunk highway system here,

00:49:50
I have a little bit of an old graph,

00:49:54
but by 2011, as far as I can read it, well,

00:49:58
but already 2009, the total amount of kilometers

00:49:59
of motorways in both countries,

00:50:02
US and China was equal.

00:50:03
And the one in China, of course,

00:50:06
was rising still very steep.

00:50:10
But you can see that this, I don't like the term,

00:50:14
let's say the catching up on this idea of following a little bit in the

00:50:18
footsteps of what the Americans did in the 1950s. In China happened in an

00:50:24
extremely short time which not only because of the construction of the

00:50:29
motorways but this was a very important part of the construction boom meant

00:50:36
that from 2006 to 2007 onwards now the situation is a little bit different

00:50:39
because of the ongoing crisis and also other problems that Chinese

00:50:46
economy suffered from, but the consumption or the demand for concrete in China was bigger than

00:50:51
in all other countries around the world combined. So this was really a boom of an unprecedented

00:50:59
scale and we will see a few other graphs down the lecture which show us that while in many

00:51:04
cities and many countries don't know what we might be thinking that we are moving away from the

00:51:09
the current right now, but that's the idea that the other parts of the world that did

00:51:15
not experience this development at the same time as local North are now definitely contributing

00:51:21
to not even I would say persistence or vulnerability, but actually it's continuous rise

00:51:28
in the global scale. What was very important going back to the Belgium context of the

00:51:30
in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:51:34
It's also difficult to say what was first the car

00:51:36
or the suburbs or the suburbs in the car,

00:51:39
but the two were extremely strongly linked

00:51:40
with one another.

00:51:44
Having the car, and as I mentioned,

00:51:47
as I explained, the car became a very common popular

00:51:49
and cheap commodity.

00:51:52
Not only did you find how you moved to work

00:51:53
and you move around the city,

00:51:54
but actually it's again,

00:51:56
redefine what the city is.

00:51:59
So suddenly areas which would be normally considered rule

00:52:03
become accessible and become interesting for people

00:52:05
to settle in.

00:52:07
The idea also being that you have more space,

00:52:08
more freedom,

00:52:14
you are close to your close to nature, et cetera, et cetera.

00:52:18
These days it might feel like it's something of the past,

00:52:23
something that is not interesting to many urbanites

00:52:26
of today, but back then it was absolutely

00:52:33
way to the way to go, the way to live, the way to think that one should invest as a household

00:52:45
in a home market, in property market. The special results of that, the double dynamic of

00:52:53
motorization of one hand, suborganization of the other, was that if a pre industrial city had a

00:52:58
more or less 10% of its space devoted to transport and mobility. An industrial

00:53:07
modern city has between 15 and 30% and that's rough estimates from Western Europe to up to 60%

00:53:14
in some American cities of space will be given to mobility infrastructure which is principally

00:53:22
highways and parking lots, which of course is a huge spatial cost.

00:53:30
And, well, another development, of course, is that the commuting area that we start to call it,

00:53:38
so the actual definition of what a city is, regardless of administrative limits and different boundaries,

00:53:45
of course, this would be often divided into some municipalities and all, it goes up to 100 kilometres in diameter.

00:53:48
So suddenly what is a city becomes,

00:53:53
it stands becoming a little bit vague in the sense that the old urban course,

00:53:59
of course, do not hold all the functions anymore and we start seeing cities,

00:54:04
expanding at least in economic terms.

00:54:14
Well, without running into the risk of simplifying things a little bit too much,

00:54:26
But what happened in a lot of cities, both in North America and in Western Europe, is that as the car became more and more popular and as moving by car became absolutely common.

00:54:34
And if you basically had a middle-class job, that's what you did. You lived in the suburbs and you created through the office job by car.

00:54:38
Trans-and companies, or mass transit companies,

00:54:39
probably transport companies,

00:54:42
started to run into serious financial difficulties.

00:54:47
So traditionally, when they were actually set up

00:54:51
in the 19th century, 1910s, 1920s,

00:54:52
they would be private companies very often,

00:54:54
private railroads bringing workers

00:54:58
to the suburbs in Darchle, bringing the bourgeois

00:55:00
and people who wanted to enjoy leisure

00:55:03
outside of the city and then back.

00:55:07
As they started to run into trouble in some countries,

00:55:09
and that's usually the case in Western Europe,

00:55:10
they would be nationalized.

00:55:11
They would be taken over by the state

00:55:14
as an important part of military infrastructure,

00:55:18
but also an important part of mobility infrastructure

00:55:21
and kept, but they enrolled the societal role

00:55:22
with definitely declined,

00:55:25
so they would become something not necessarily

00:55:28
for the middle class, but rather for the working class.

00:55:32
Belgium here is some sort of an exception

00:55:35
because a lot of commuting here,

00:55:38
due to the fact that the railway system was traditionally

00:55:42
been very dense, happened and still is happening

00:55:43
very much through public transport.

00:55:46
But that's definitely not the case in the UK, for example,

00:55:48
or definitely not in North America.

00:55:52
But, and sticking to North America,

00:55:55
in a number of cities over there,

00:55:58
the process that happened was inverse.

00:55:59
So the decline of public transit did not

00:56:02
lead to any investment by the state.

00:56:06
either on federal or on the state-state level,

00:56:09
but rather eventually dismantling

00:56:12
of public transport systems happened.

00:56:16
And a very particular story is that of the general

00:56:17
modus company.

00:56:19
So one of the main producers of these masks

00:56:22
come on with these with the cars.

00:56:25
Who threw out the 1940s basically bought

00:56:27
a number of public transport companies,

00:56:29
massive companies as they are called over there.

00:56:32
and purposely led to the decline.

00:56:33
Why?

00:56:35
Well, the idea was quite simple.

00:56:37
It was basically the derivative of the competition

00:56:41
that public transport could have posed

00:56:44
to the individual ability to the car.

00:56:48
So the idea was to push public transport out of the market.

00:56:52
And again, I just saw the comment from somebody.

00:56:57
And again, yes, the idea of course

00:56:59
was that this was also framed by the discourse

00:57:03
of modernity and advancing as a society.

00:57:06
I forgot to mention that we will be taking a break

00:57:08
in both today and in the week.

00:57:10
I don't think that sticking to the stream

00:57:12
to ours is a helpful thing to do.

00:57:14
So we will take a break actually in three minutes

00:57:16
probably for about five minutes.

00:57:19
And just in case you're getting a little bit tight.

00:57:26
But this total decline or some would even say it is up

00:57:29
I would even say a disaster in terms of what happened to mass transport, mass transit,

00:57:33
sorry, public transport was not always the case.

00:57:38
So as I already mentioned, in some countries, public transport networks actually were

00:57:41
taken over by the state and even invested in.

00:57:47
And one important thing that happened, or a symbolic project that happened is that of Copenhagen's

00:57:49
fingerplant from 1947.

00:57:55
So basically there, the decision was made to create an alternative, or maybe not a substitute,

00:57:57
an alternative parallel to car commuting.

00:58:03
Basically suburban rail, which follows the shape of fine figures.

00:58:05
Corridors that would not only be transport corridors,

00:58:09
but also along which a number of different functions,

00:58:13
especially residential, but also economic work,

00:58:17
related functions would be placed as well.

00:58:20
And that was, as far as I know, one of the first plans

00:58:23
that try to achieve what we call

00:58:25
transport-oriented development, or development

00:58:29
urban development that happens around, or in this particular case,

00:58:33
along transport corridors to allow for different mobility

00:58:36
options back then, maybe, environmental issues

00:58:38
were not so much on the agenda, but the idea

00:58:40
was that people would be able to get more efficiently

00:58:46
to work, not only by car, but also by suburban rail.

00:58:51
In our lovely Brussels, well, things were not so easy,

00:58:53
Well, things were a little bit in between.

00:58:56
So on the one hand, the car was definitely the king.

00:59:01
And actually it's one of the slogans in Brussels

00:59:04
sent it academia and public debate.

00:59:06
Car it became the king around the 1950s

00:59:08
with the expo of the 1958.

00:59:10
And still very much is a very present

00:59:12
and very privileged lot of transport.

00:59:14
But public transport, of course, did not

00:59:16
disappear on one of the particularities of Brussels

00:59:19
is that unlike in Sharawa, for example,

00:59:22
or many cities in Germany or in France,

00:59:24
especially Trang was, for example,

00:59:25
were never completely dismantled.

00:59:30
And you would see, and I can't think of any specific names

00:59:33
right now in France, but there are cities in which

00:59:37
Trang, way network existed, you know, 1940s, '50s and '60s,

00:59:42
and then was completely dismantled to open a surface space

00:59:43
to the car.

00:59:46
So what happened in Brussels is that the Trang was basically

00:59:49
put on the ground, so you see on top left,

00:59:54
Rinalalwa, which is that magnificent open waterway these days.

00:59:57
And you see a tram trying to plow its way

01:00:01
through the city, standing in a traffic jam.

01:00:04
The idea, well, of course, the city has packed

01:00:06
the spaces limited with the rise of mobility

01:00:08
and the individual mobility.

01:00:11
And the rise of an hour of course, traffic jams happen.

01:00:14
The decision there was made not to make more space

01:00:19
the tram would make to make more space for the car. So a strategic decision was to put the tram

01:00:26
first underground, creating a very particular mode of transport made in Brussels called pre-metro

01:00:33
kamitho, which then eventually as it was actually planned was converted into a full scale,

01:00:38
as we call it in Brussels, heavy metro metrolu. You can actually see a pre-metrol still,

01:00:43
and that's line three and four in Brussels at Tramline that goes from north to south of the Pentagon,

01:00:49
which as you probably have heard is now well will soon be converted into a proper

01:00:55
metro of once and a new metro line from the gallery knob and northwards is constructed.

01:01:01
So you get for example C, I don't know if you ever had a chance of you know noting that the

01:01:04
platforms and although this is a trans stock the platforms are actually much much wider than

01:01:06
and usually would be in the case of a tram

01:01:08
and they are much longer.

01:01:10
Basically they were built,

01:01:12
I think already back in the 70s,

01:01:15
anticipating a proper metro, we are now in 2020.

01:01:18
So if I need a metro, it's happening,

01:01:21
although well, it's a controversial project to sit at least.

01:01:25
Let's take a little break here,

01:01:27
not longer than five, six minutes.

01:01:30
So grab another tea, you're a coffee,

01:01:34
and I'll see you back in four, five minutes, all right?

01:01:36
Great, I'm going to see you in a moment.

01:06:26
The

01:06:27
C

01:06:43
Welcome back all of you. I hope you grabbed another drink or whatever it is that you are

01:06:48
having. Grab another notebook to keep helping things, although of course you've got the

01:06:55
recording of all this. And I can see that some people are asking questions. I might also

01:07:01
ask you with up to now, up to now everything has been clear or you've got any questions

01:07:06
about what I've been talking about. If yes, please raise your hand, just speak up. But I think

01:07:13
it's an interesting question that Mika asked here in the chat, whether in need what's happening

01:07:20
right now is that we have an increased desire for what we could say is a pre-industrial city,

01:07:28
a city of walking of short distances, density of uses, mixes. Does anybody have an opinion on this?

01:07:30
Would you agree? Would you not agree?

01:07:40
Or maybe Mika, whether he or she is, has an opinion?

01:07:50
It's me. Yeah, I wasn't sure if it's really linked to the pre-industrial city, but when you explained

01:07:56
how it was looking, how it looked like.

01:08:00
I thought about actually it's exactly what today's planning is about.

01:08:12
Like this mixed use, this like, and narrow streets where you workability and short distances.

01:08:17
And I mean, maybe it's also really a European perspective.

01:08:26
I'm not sure about that. I thought maybe it could be like a new role model of today's planning.

01:08:30
Does anybody have an opinion on this? Would anybody like to react?

01:08:46
I can compare it for example in Antroop. I live in the center of the city.

01:08:54
but we see that the place for private cars is reducing.

01:09:02
For example, they put parking lots under undergrounds for making some leisure activities or parks

01:09:09
or something else. So we see a movement, I guess, when we focus on that. And definitely in Brussels,

01:09:13
depending on the policy now, it's more ecological

01:09:20
minus and we see more opportunities to reduce

01:09:26
parking lots and more movements like for example in Anspaklam.

01:09:31
In the Kitton years it's called the pedestrian area of Brussels.

01:09:32
Yeah yeah.

01:09:36
We couldn't imagine I guess 20 years ago so we see different movements.

01:09:40
Yeah, there is definitely some kind of shift happening.

01:09:46
I mean, we are not in the 1960s or 70s, not where what is right now on this slide.

01:09:50
Things have moved on. The presence of the car is definitely put on the question.

01:09:53
But is this about going to a three-industrial city?

01:09:54
What would be the problem with that?

01:09:59
Or would be the risk of just to revert into walking, let's say,

01:10:02
if that's what the pre-industrial city was about.

01:10:10
as anybody have, you know, an opinion on this. There was no wrong answers here.

01:10:16
We tell you saying that new mobility plans are aiming in the best of use of all technologies

01:10:23
we have now with maximum inclusivity. Yeah, I guess so. Proof is in the, you know,

01:10:29
well, it depends on how they, of course, implemented and it's the idea, of course, is that

01:10:32
that everybody is included and we use all the technologies we have.

01:10:36
In practice, we will see that it's a little bit complicated.

01:10:46
Maybe it's also the light when we were looking at the metro system that it's more about underground transportation.

01:10:49
So like separation.

01:10:50
Okay.

01:10:52
Transportation systems.

01:10:58
Somebody else started talking. Who was that?

01:11:28
Yeah, that was me. And also what I wanted to bring up was this idea of Brussels is a productive city where industries or small businesses are still located and where people can have, you know, can find jobs almost in their neighborhood that it, you know, especially maybe jobs that don't necessarily pay so well that wouldn't be interesting for other people to to commute into the city to. And I think these kind of businesses are a bit under pressure from.

01:11:34
the reduction in space that they have on, you know, to organize these productive activities.

01:11:42
So I think, yeah, space in front of their, in front of the street, to actually do their deliveries.

01:11:48
And I think as a tension there in the kind of city, you want, and the way you want the service,

01:11:56
different neighborhoods and different areas. So one of the cases was like these smaller construction,

01:12:01
and supplies kind of stores, maybe in the area of LAC and,

01:12:04
like not far from the canal,

01:12:08
serving a kind of secondary places where,

01:12:10
you just wouldn't go to Brico

01:12:14
for those kind of materials, you would go to your neighborhood

01:12:18
and that's becoming harder to maintain

01:12:22
in an urban environment that gives more space to walking

01:12:29
to buy claims and so on. So that's on the one side. It doesn't mean that I agree, but it's,

01:12:37
I think one of the pressures that is being felt by that group.

01:12:41
I guess what's important what you said, and to relate it also to what I was talking about

01:12:45
before and what Vitali there is, the right thing is that there is some with each of these

01:12:51
technological shifts. Of course, they are very, I mean, it's a very broad sketch. These things

01:12:56
when all happening in sudden turns, it's a process.

01:12:59
But space is valorised in different ways.

01:13:04
And for example, if we see here in this slide, as I mentioned,

01:13:07
clearly space became very limited with the rise of the cars.

01:13:10
And the decision was made of the space is extremely valuable.

01:13:12
And it should be given to the modes that

01:13:14
is the most efficient in terms of speed,

01:13:18
as the most rational mode also, not only economically

01:13:20
or temporally efficient.

01:13:24
So other modes like public transport, I haven't even mentioned cycling there,

01:13:28
had to disappear or be moved elsewhere.

01:13:30
And I think what's happening right now is some kind of

01:13:32
revolarization of space.

01:13:34
But space is always limited.

01:13:40
So if you take it, I mean, if you give it to one or some set of users,

01:13:44
which I think also, perhaps we will have time to talk about it next week,

01:13:45
has a clear class component.

01:13:53
So there is a clear middle class idea behind opening central airman spaces to walking, cycling,

01:13:56
and public transport and taking it away from the car.

01:14:00
So if you give it to these kind of users, you have to take it away from others, in this

01:14:02
case, the car.

01:14:07
And I think an important question is to ask, well, if we want the car to disappear from

01:14:09
the city life, from Russell's, who is using the car, right?

01:14:17
me who is dependent on it. For example, these businesses, small shops that, I don't know,

01:14:23
either, well, I mean, the productive activity requires accessibility by cow. But also, I think,

01:14:29
probably you've heard right now in this pandemic crazy times, people are talking about 15 minute

01:14:35
neighbourhood and the idea of how the pandemic has shown us that we can, well, since we

01:14:40
essentially, and many of us stop a lot of activities. We start walking around and cycling and all that.

01:14:46
So the idea that maybe we could use this to reorganize the cities around 15 minute

01:14:51
perimeters walking perimeters within which we can all find all the users and functions that we need.

01:14:57
But I think an important question there is who actually lives so close to a good school,

01:15:04
a good job and all that. And in Perasos, many other cities, there will be a lot of people who need to

01:15:07
to find employment quite far from where they live.

01:15:10
And a lot of them would have to go by car

01:15:11
to get to that job.

01:15:13
So what, you know, what then,

01:15:19
I will continue with the lecture,

01:15:23
but I hope there will be space for more questions.

01:15:24
There was one point that I want to make

01:15:27
that is, you know, I don't want to say

01:15:30
a main conclusion of this historical trajectory,

01:15:32
but I think an important point

01:15:35
to keep in mind, you know, this is that

01:15:41
it's not just a descriptive, you know,

01:15:43
to the force of what different modes of transport

01:15:46
were there and how it impacted the urban form.

01:15:48
I think this is something that is maybe

01:15:50
a little bit interesting, but essentially,

01:15:51
I don't think it's very critical

01:15:54
and doesn't really allow us to understand

01:15:56
too much about how the city functions are functioned

01:15:57
in the past.

01:15:59
I think what's very important though

01:16:01
is that with each of these shifts,

01:16:04
with each of these turning points and dynamics

01:16:08
that led to shift in terms of how people move.

01:16:12
We're getting closer and closer to the situation

01:16:14
that we have today, which is that transport

01:16:17
is absolutely crucial not only for the development

01:16:22
of cities, but for the development of the socioeconomic system

01:16:24
in which we live today on the global scale,

01:16:27
which is of global capitalism.

01:16:31
So it would be impossible for the current socioeconomic relations

01:16:33
to develop to the point that they have developed

01:16:36
without transport and without the development of transport

01:16:37
and vice versa.

01:16:39
So outside of the capitalist system,

01:16:42
they probably would not have been such a push

01:16:45
for development of individual mobility, for example,

01:16:47
and the visual mobility by car that is propelled

01:16:51
by fossil fuels with all the geopolitical

01:16:55
and environmental atrocities and impacts that this produces.

01:17:19
Essentially transport or transport geography is a discipline required space not only to be conquered physically in terms of distance basically moving from A to B would become as fast as short of a time as possible, but also some kind of imaginary and cartographical colonisation of concrete of space.

01:17:25
If we go back to end of the 18th century, for example, in Europe, well, the majority of

01:17:30
people who inhabited, well, maybe eight of the 17th century to be a little bit less controversial,

01:17:34
but the majority of people who lived on our continent and definitely the majority of people

01:17:39
who lived on our planet did not live under jurisdiction of any state or any state administration.

01:17:45
They essentially lived outside the state structures. Of course, states and administration existed,

01:17:51
But most people lived in villages in areas where once in a while, a tax collector would

01:17:56
maybe show up or be quite easy to avoid the encounter with that kind of gentleman,

01:18:00
rather not gentle moment, I'm afraid.

01:18:05
So it's at this point, and I think transport is absolutely crucial for understanding of

01:18:09
why this happened and how this happened, that there happened or the beginning to happen

01:18:13
in a strategic expansion of state infrastructure and state administration.

01:18:18
predominantly related security reasons and search for different forms of capital,

01:18:25
for instance, slavery, so trying to reach different places where bodies could be snatched,

01:18:30
taken into captivity and then sold or propelled into productivity.

01:18:36
But for the state to be able to organize this process, it had to develop its

01:18:42
cartography, it has to develop its dominance, its knowledge, its control over space.

01:18:49
And here we see a map of France in the 1632, which is essentially, well, we've seen some roads,

01:18:56
we see some cities and connections between those. But this radically changes with the

01:19:01
development of state's interest in terms of the resources, as I mentioned, bodies, people,

01:19:08
but also of course other natural resources would anything that you can mine and I don't know

01:19:13
it's not especially here in terms of who you can be interested in as a state but what essentially

01:19:19
happened is that from a natural space, a space that was inhabited, a space that was lived,

01:19:28
we started moving into a fire name of abstracted of of absolute space that is very much related

01:19:35
to the consolidation of states infrastructure as a way of organizing social and material order

01:19:40
that is on the ground to bureaucratically govern it to rule it from the distance, from a very top

01:19:45
down perspective. The example of France is very interesting because literally over there the decision

01:19:52
was made of course not immediately in one meeting but progressively it was a state bureaucracy

01:19:58
a rather decision to divide the state in more or less equally shaped areas, the departments

01:20:04
based on a regular grid. On the left hand side you see there's some kind of conceptualization of

01:20:10
this. On the right hand side we see a result which is the actual, the eventual division. I think one

01:20:16
of the first ones in the French territory. I think today of course it's not exactly the same that

01:20:19
has developed for different historical reasons.

01:20:21
But the idea was very important.

01:20:25
The Ministry of Reform of the 1790

01:20:30
would replace an old feudal tribal, even division

01:20:33
of territories into--

01:20:36
it would be your place with abstract bureaucratic logic

01:20:39
that would be applied in a more or less the same way

01:20:46
in each of these territories, each of these departments.

01:20:48
this week in skip.

01:20:51
What was very important in this development

01:20:58
is that the state needed very much universal,

01:21:01
I don't know how to put it, a reliable system

01:21:05
of measuring space and other related phenomena,

01:21:07
such as, for example, time and quantity.

01:21:10
It might be very difficult for us to imagine this,

01:21:14
but the unification of measuring systems

01:21:19
of time and space and quantity was something that took a very long time and it was definitely not

01:21:26
in place until end of the even 17 or 18 centuries. So it took a very long time to actually make sure

01:21:32
sorry - make sure that all inhabitants of a given nation state of a given territory would actually

01:21:37
subjugate themselves to the usage of a unified - that's the word I was looking for - unified

01:21:43
metric or measurement system. So for example the unification of the metric systems in Germany took

01:21:50
place in as late as 1868 in Austria in 1871 and Hungary three years later in Russia in 1919

01:21:56
and in China only in 1959. What does it mean? It means that there exist of course ways of measuring

01:22:01
but there will be culturally dependent or there will be spatially dependent. So a particular

01:22:08
unit of measurement, a foot, an elbow would mean different things and different villages.

01:22:12
It would mean different things at a different times of the day or year. It would mean different

01:22:18
things whether it would be the activity of selling or buying. For example, you would sell

01:22:26
a small bag of rice and buy a big one. There was a difference between that's in many pre-colonial,

01:22:32
African communities, kingdoms. There will be a division between strong measures for selling

01:22:39
goods and weak measures for buying goods. So there was a huge diversity of different ways of

01:22:43
measuring space, measuring time, and measuring quantity.

01:22:47
All that in all the, and also because of, and again,

01:22:50
this is a two-way dynamic, the development of the transport

01:22:53
system and the development of state as an institution

01:22:56
or a set of institutions that had to control space,

01:23:01
quantity, and time gave way to a unified system,

01:23:04
of which transport is absolutely central in here.

01:23:08
I mean, the symbolic one meter, which is, of course,

01:23:14
huge upstream agreement that we are in, that this is what one meter is, and the same could be said

01:23:20
about the kilogram of the second and many others. Moving a little bit more, going a little bit

01:23:27
more into transport here, I mentioned time and for example as late as in the late 18th century,

01:23:31
distance between particular cities and as a result travel times between particular cities,

01:23:37
such as in Germany, we're not fixed or set.

01:23:41
So in 1881, German railways or different kinds of German

01:23:43
railways because there was no one national system

01:23:44
followed to five different times us, which

01:23:49
were different not by one hour but by a different amount of minutes,

01:23:52
which meant that basically one area, I guess,

01:23:57
the archaea color coded, would be five or seven minutes ahead of the other one,

01:23:59
which meant that the passengers had to do the calculation themselves.

01:24:06
it was all an oral agreement and an ongoing discussion between the passengers and the staff

01:24:12
to understand what time things would happen, what time the train would depart, leave, etc.

01:24:23
And as I mentioned, this integration of measurement system, integration of different modes of

01:24:28
of transport networks allowed the state to control,

01:24:33
to consolidate the territory, and to basically be able

01:24:37
to develop socioeconomic relations that we take today

01:24:40
very much for granted.

01:24:42
This was absolutely crucial.

01:24:44
I mean, the reason why I'm making this a bit of a digression

01:24:47
and the departure from historic trajectories

01:24:51
that this was absolutely crucial, this colonisation of space

01:24:53
and colonization of what we consider to be

01:24:55
a very much of a social or good consideration,

01:24:59
social activity, movement and transport is,

01:25:01
was absolutely crucial for the development of,

01:25:03
again, what we take very much for granted,

01:25:07
the global networks of YS, cables, railroads,

01:25:08
highways in this particular case,

01:25:12
I already showed you that map,

01:25:17
allowing transport to lubricate the capitalist global system.

01:25:22
And today, this colonization of space,

01:25:25
if we can call it this way, it's no longer a national matter,

01:25:27
it's no longer nation-states that are propelling this process.

01:25:30
It's something that has happened very much on the global scale.

01:25:36
What was very important in this very long trajectory

01:25:39
started very quickly at the end of the 17th century.

01:25:41
Now we are in 1950s.

01:25:45
What was very important is that the whole science developed

01:25:49
around this colonization of different measuring systems

01:25:54
of different ways of living and interacting with space.

01:25:58
And this size, on this scientific field,

01:26:01
I think we can call it a set of neoclassical perspectives

01:26:05
on not only transport, also on economics, on social life,

01:26:09
which in transport itself is very much present,

01:26:13
is very much dominated by, on the 100 transport engineers,

01:26:15
on the other and the transcoli economists.

01:26:20
What I'm talking about here is basically the main, say,

01:26:22
and I will not talk a lot about this,

01:26:27
but basically if you went to a master degree,

01:26:28
which I'm very happy you did it,

01:26:31
but if you went to a master degree in transport management

01:26:34
or logistics at any technical university,

01:26:36
this is very much what you would be learning today,

01:26:38
which I guess at this time of the day or night,

01:26:40
which we are a bit more boring, I hope,

01:26:45
and what I have to offer, but hope there is no regrets here

01:26:45
in the room today.

01:26:47
But if you want to be an engineer,

01:26:49
and if you want to be an economist to go rose,

01:26:52
this is basically what you learn.

01:26:54
Why is it called Neoplastico Transport?

01:26:57
Well, very much it relates to Neoplastico Economics,

01:27:01
which deals with a cold, blooded analysis,

01:27:04
a study of distribution, production of goods,

01:27:07
outputs, and income through.

01:27:10
And that's absolutely crucial supply and demand.

01:27:15
So a system which has to be an equivalent equilibrium,

01:27:23
which essentially looks at transport as a part or a separate market in which transport

01:27:33
is a good commodity which is offered in the market, passengers being its consumers.

01:27:34
What is important here?

01:27:39
There are two main principles, which very much today, again,

01:27:42
in academia, but also very much in the world of practitioners.

01:27:45
So the world of those who plan roads, who build roads,

01:27:47
who claim that we need a new metro line,

01:27:50
we need a more to way, or that this or that particular mode

01:27:52
of transport is absolutely essential

01:27:55
for contemporary cities to thrive.

01:27:57
So these two dogmas say that on the one hand,

01:28:01
transport is an essentially rational discipline.

01:28:07
It's a discipline that is rational because it has to be developed by experts.

01:28:12
It's a top-down discipline that requires it to top-down cartographic vision of space,

01:28:17
which can reduce to its absolute universal measures.

01:28:24
That also means that there is a science behind it, which means that it's not an issue that can be fully open to a public debate.

01:28:37
It's a part of urban life that has to be developed by experts and only experts can have the final word in terms of decision-making, in terms of how transpose develops, why, and using what modes.

01:28:43
There is a very strong prediction there in this field of knowledge,

01:28:48
transport geography or transport economics and engineering are essentially objective sciences.

01:28:53
They are much more on the side of science and sciences and humanities for example.

01:28:56
They purpose being pursuing objectivity and truth.

01:29:01
It's a quote from another very important textbook on transport geography.

01:29:06
The idea being that we can arrive some kind of absolute truth in terms of what is good transport

01:29:13
and what is bad, which essentially are translatable, transferable from one locality to

01:29:22
went out. So if we go back to the 1950s, if the US cities develop motorways and develop

01:29:26
car infrastructure, which is efficient at rational, this is a solution that can also work

01:29:32
in dense medieval European cities such as the ones in Belgium to just Brussels, for

01:29:35
example.

01:29:40
Crucially, this line of thinking and that maybe didn't develop in the end of the 17th

01:29:46
in the 19th century, but was definitely a result of this process that I called the colonization

01:29:53
of space. This field of thinking and producing transport is consolidated itself around the

01:30:01
1930s and 40s and that propelled measurements and engineering studies that allowed to construct

01:30:08
these interurban and intraurban motorway systems. And this very much continues today following

01:30:12
a rule of predicting demand for mobility,

01:30:16
predicting passenger flows or traffic flows

01:30:20
and providing necessary infrastructure for it.

01:30:22
So basically most of transport,

01:30:27
most of what transport models do is predict

01:30:30
where would these flows go and provide

01:30:35
essential infrastructure and extension of a road lane,

01:30:36
a construction of a new motorway,

01:30:41
construction of the new metro line, you name it.

01:30:45
So that's one part of the rationality of transport.

01:30:48
The other part is that the assumption is that the user itself

01:30:54
and it's, yeah, the user itself is also a rational being.

01:31:01
It's a homo, economic, it's an economically minded being

01:31:05
that almost on a regular basis, on a daily basis,

01:31:11
conduct some kind of economic analysis in terms of what is an efficient way of reaching

01:31:19
an destination B from point A in terms of time, in terms of cost, being, making pragmatic

01:31:25
free and very much utility-based choices in terms of how to move and where to move.

01:31:32
So in other words, a market, a market that is being governed by the laws of economics,

01:31:38
very much in this line of thought are being compared to the loss of physics. A lot of these models

01:31:44
would have, for example, illusions to gravity, so gravity, models that in a natural light way

01:31:50
pulls, flows of passengers to some destinations rather than others because for example, economic

01:31:58
and connectivity is present in an area. So that's principle of dogma number one. Number two is that

01:32:06
But there is this very strong conviction and funny enough, still not fully proven, but the

01:32:11
conviction is very much there, that investment in transport infrastructure, of course,

01:32:13
that part is not controversial.

01:32:19
Least of high speeds, leads to low and travel times, leads to lower transaction costs

01:32:24
if you want to move from A to B or sell for some goods, it's basically cheaper, leads

01:32:25
to economic development.

01:32:30
So the better infrastructure we have, the higher or the better

01:32:32
the growth of a locality.

01:32:36
So if you want the city to be economically prosperous,

01:32:42
wealthy, you need quality transport infrastructure.

01:32:50
So that very much is underpinned by this quarter

01:32:51
that I already mentioned earlier today,

01:32:54
that the unique purpose of transport is, in fact,

01:32:57
to limit, to reduce space and time that is needed

01:32:59
to cover the space to zero,

01:33:04
so that that is the unique purpose of movement in the city,

01:33:06
which also means that the travel time itself

01:33:08
is an unproductive activity,

01:33:10
because from the monetary perspective,

01:33:12
if you want to go from A to B,

01:33:14
well, you want to get there as quickly as possible.

01:33:15
The time of getting there itself

01:33:18
is not a valuable activity.

01:33:20
Now, there are, I mean, there was a flurry of problems here,

01:33:23
starting from the fact that if you actually ask people

01:33:25
through studies, what they do when they take the metro

01:33:29
or where they cycle, which is such a complicated

01:33:30
and multi-faceted activity.

01:33:34
They often say that this is actually a very important part

01:33:37
of the day, that commuting on public transport, for example,

01:33:39
allows them to catch up with friends, to read,

01:33:43
to relax, to meditate, cycling being,

01:33:45
as I mentioned, multi-faceted activity

01:33:48
that allows people to get relaxed, work out,

01:33:52
get an endorphin kick and all that.

01:33:57
And that's so much more than just moving from one place to another.

01:34:04
But again, without trying to draw some kind of caricature,

01:34:09
I think it's important to understand that this way of thinking about transport

01:34:13
leads us to a formulation of an absolutely fundamental problem

01:34:17
in inverted commons that a lot of engineers, transport engineers,

01:34:18
and transport economists recognize.

01:34:20
And that problem is congestion.

01:34:25
if you focus on fluid flow of passengers, cars,

01:34:28
whatever the transport mode is,

01:34:30
any obstruction to that flow,

01:34:34
any obstruction to that model is a problem that has to be solved.

01:34:36
And that problem has to be solved

01:34:38
because otherwise the system is irrational.

01:34:40
So that's number one.

01:34:43
And the second reason is that,

01:34:46
unless you do that, you can

01:34:53
the economic growth, economic development of the locality that you are in in in charge of.

01:34:59
As I mentioned this this beneficial, supposed to be beneficial relationship between

01:35:04
transport development and economic development. So better roads, I mean better transport,

01:35:09
better exchange of goods and services. That of course works to some extent. I mean you can

01:35:16
you can see that having theoretically at least from scratch in in many cities in many countries

01:35:21
from the global south. But then this relation has never really been theorized, it's never

01:35:27
really been proven. And it will be extremely difficult to make that claim in cities that

01:35:31
are postmodern, such as Brussels or many other cities in the global north, but actually increasing

01:35:37
the global south. So addition of infrastructure, especially road infrastructure, current

01:35:43
infrastructure, and it's anticipated impact in terms of economic growth, economic development,

01:35:49
It's a very controversial issue that, well, it's not really, we don't have any tangible

01:35:55
proof or the tangible enough to say with certainty that this is the case.

01:36:01
But it's an argument that you can hear a lot, including in Brussels and Belgium.

01:36:02
Is this clear?

01:36:04
Do you have any questions?

01:36:08
This is usually where people are scratching the hands a little bit, so I want to make

01:36:11
sure that you are okay.

01:36:19
nobody is running anything in a chat, no angry comments, I keep advancing here then.

01:36:24
So what happens when you believe that what you do is rational and it's very important

01:36:27
for society, for economy?

01:36:34
Well, you essentially engage in developing more and more and more elaborate and complicated

01:36:37
mathematical models that try to predict.

01:36:39
not only to describe what's happening

01:36:43
but actually trying to predict what is going to happen.

01:36:46
What is now happening very much in the business

01:36:48
of transport economics and transport engineering

01:36:50
is modeling human behavior.

01:36:53
So trying to predict where people will be interested

01:36:55
in going and not anymore,

01:36:57
where they are actually are heading

01:36:59
and where these flows are being distributed

01:37:01
in an urban environment.

01:37:04
What's crucial here is that this field is extremely,

01:37:06
not only extremely technical and quantitative,

01:37:08
whether it's very descriptive,

01:37:11
so this logic of transport supply and transport demands

01:37:16
is devoid of any social, cultural, political relations.

01:37:20
When I say that a transport user

01:37:22
is homo-economic, is considered to be

01:37:26
a this rational utility-based person or figure

01:37:28
that makes these rational choices

01:37:31
in terms of whether or how any issue of gender,

01:37:36
an issue of class, of ethnicity, of age is at best mentioned,

01:37:40
but given a very little weight,

01:37:41
if we are talking about modeling,

01:37:43
so these different aspects can be given

01:37:46
different weights, given different importance,

01:37:49
importance, different levels of importance.

01:37:52
And these issues are quite simply not there.

01:37:54
And of course, we will be discussing this a little bit.

01:37:57
I mean, these different critical approaches,

01:38:02
such as some anti-capitalist Marxist, feminist,

01:38:06
and eranical theory, social theory,

01:38:10
the exposure to those in engineering programs

01:38:13
is close to none, which basically means

01:38:16
that without trying to be too critical

01:38:18
about their genius who are trying to do their job,

01:38:20
basically they are really not aware

01:38:23
of the complexity of social relations

01:38:25
and spatial relations that are happening in cities.

01:38:31
So everything that you've learned with David Barson Nick by now, this is simply not there.

01:38:38
A city, according to this vision, is essentially a model that can be constructed,

01:38:46
calculated and put in place, and you can predict what will happen tomorrow, the day after

01:38:50
based on that, in any city in the world.

01:38:58
Now that thinking has a very, yeah, very, very strange way of imagining the city.

01:39:05
Essentially if a city is or any urban space is more of a field of application, then actually

01:39:10
a site of any dynamics or conflicts or contradictions, different interests in terms of what

01:39:13
should be happening in that space and that society.

01:39:15
And I'm sure that you've all come across

01:39:19
many even these drawings over similar ones

01:39:23
from from the Go was here and his friends and allies,

01:39:26
who basically imagined that this is exactly what should happen

01:39:29
in a modern city, that these models,

01:39:31
not only related to transport in this case

01:39:33
also to housing or generally economic development

01:39:36
should be literally applied in a city.

01:39:39
So the idea there wouldn't be that

01:39:42
in order to for that model to be as efficient as possible,

01:39:45
everything in the city, especially its medieval,

01:39:48
pre-industrial remnants would have to be raised.

01:39:51
The city would have to become a black empty slate

01:39:55
on which this model could be applied.

01:40:02
So even though this maybe wasn't its most extreme

01:40:06
in the 1950s and the 1960s,

01:40:09
when these urban motorways were being constructed

01:40:13
when, as I showed you, urban trunks and Brussels were being put

01:40:17
underground and a lot of heavy construction offers,

01:40:19
destruction had to be done.

01:40:21
This thinking is still very much applies.

01:40:25
This, if you tune into engineers from construction offices

01:40:29
in Brussels or elsewhere in Belgium or Northern Europe,

01:40:35
the idea is that planning still has to follow some rational rules

01:40:37
of solving congestion.

01:40:40
in Brussels, for example, we have a Belgium-a-log stand

01:40:42
and debate about what to do with the Ringo

01:40:44
Brussels, the Ringo, who has to be expanded or not.

01:40:46
Every single time there is an engineer talking

01:40:50
on the radio and the news, what their solution would be

01:40:51
is to answer to the infrastructure,

01:40:53
because basically if you have traffic jams

01:40:56
that generates lost time, that's the tremendous economy.

01:40:58
You have to expand an infrastructure

01:41:01
in order for the flows to be more fluid and unobstructed.

01:41:07
This modern new classical thinking also,

01:41:11
Well, you're thinking about fluidity of flows

01:41:14
and removing barriers to these led

01:41:16
to a separation of different modes of transport.

01:41:21
So this is why we would have overpasses,

01:41:23
food bridges that would allow

01:41:27
or well separate pedestrians from cars, for example.

01:41:32
So allow the cars to have a smooth space infrastructure

01:41:35
for movement while pedestrians would have to

01:41:39
across it over an ordinary.

01:41:44
And that of course also that line of thought

01:41:46
would be very much related or very much inspired

01:41:49
also by the development of individual mobility

01:41:50
via the car, right?

01:41:54
So the car being not only this extremely free mode

01:41:56
of transport also very rational and very fast

01:41:58
while you're moving around.

01:42:03
Now, we arrived to the 1970s, let's say,

01:42:06
and something very important happened around that time

01:42:09
Would anybody have an idea of being in the pictures?

01:42:12
What, what I have in mind?

01:42:16
Not change the way that we look at the car,

01:42:19
the change the way we look at the transport.

01:42:20
Your prices?

01:42:23
The oil prices, I guess somebody already mentioned

01:42:24
that in one of the classes.

01:42:27
So the oil trucks in the 1970s,

01:42:29
when first in the 1973,

01:42:34
the organization of our petroleum exporting countries.

01:42:38
So essentially the Persian Gulf countries in the United

01:42:42
in Nolimbago and the 1979 Iranian revolution took place.

01:42:45
That's not something that you can easily model.

01:42:46
That's geopolitics for you.

01:42:49
And what basically happened is that the global oil prices

01:42:53
went through the roof, not maybe for a moment, for a longer time.

01:42:56
And then they went down a little bit to a level

01:42:59
that allowed, of course, for car-based mobility

01:43:05
to continue, but what basically happened was that on a global

01:43:09
scale decision makers, people who were in charge of designing

01:43:13
transport infrastructure, realized that this limitless mobility

01:43:18
by car has its economic cost, so all that fossil fuels might

01:43:22
not be as available as they used to be.

01:43:26
But also around that time began to begin some kind of,

01:43:30
as moved to this slide already,

01:43:35
reflection on different externalities

01:43:38
are different also social and environmental costs

01:43:41
that are related to carvests mobility.

01:43:44
This environmental cost being, for example,

01:43:48
predominantly noise, of course, accidents,

01:43:51
health related issues, mostly related to pollution

01:43:55
that is created by an individual cast.

01:43:59
And at a run at that time,

01:44:01
I mean, maybe it's also difficult for us to imagine,

01:44:06
but until the 1970s, the idea that a car has to be efficient

01:44:08
in terms of its fuel consumption,

01:44:12
not has to be safe in terms of making sure that if it hits,

01:44:14
other vehicles or if it hits pedestrians or cyclists

01:44:17
it has to be more or less safe

01:44:20
and there are these different areas of the car

01:44:24
that absorb the energy of the impact.

01:44:27
That was all essentially not the day

01:44:29
with some exceptions.

01:44:32
A car was the cars were not efficient

01:44:34
from the economic perspective,

01:44:36
from the environment of the perspective either.

01:44:42
What changed is that, well,

01:44:44
I'm again moving very fast

01:44:46
in these developments.

01:44:50
What changed is that there was first a reflection

01:44:53
on the environmental impact of the car itself.

01:44:56
And the general reflection on the questions

01:44:58
to sustainable development of development

01:45:02
that allows future generations to benefit

01:45:04
from the same resources from the same opportunities

01:45:07
that we are benefiting from today.

01:45:10
So some kind of beginning of a reflection

01:45:14
in terms of the planetary limits of the growth

01:45:16
that our societies are,

01:45:19
of the societies at the time where we're engaging in.

01:45:25
And also an idea that cities are absolutely crucial

01:45:28
for that in that process that in order

01:45:32
to arrive with sustainability of the development

01:45:36
of the planetary level, cities have to also be

01:45:40
transformed in order to become more sustainable.

01:45:47
Why is that important that we arrive to today

01:45:49
to contemporary situation?

01:45:54
Well, it's important, and this is, as also the title says,

01:45:59
this is the, let's say, another set of also very dominant

01:46:01
and very, very important,

01:46:04
and I was hegemonic perspectives on transport,

01:46:06
sustainable transport.

01:46:08
This is because transport is recognized today.

01:46:12
It's one of the most important sources of contributions

01:46:12
to pollution here.

01:46:17
We see that it's at least 14% of CO2 emissions

01:46:21
on the global scale as the direct emissions.

01:46:25
And also, while the graph, I would say that it's a little bit

01:46:28
controversial because you also could add much more in terms of the

01:46:32
different other related cost of construction and the way

01:46:36
that housing is constructed as a function of availability of

01:46:39
transport. But let's say we stick to the 40% of global emissions

01:46:43
being related directly to transport, which makes transport one of

01:46:46
Well, here I'm a little bit wrong.

01:46:48
That is the largest single source of global transport

01:46:52
emissions because you immediately see that industry is at 21%.

01:46:55
We also boiled to different sectors and all that.

01:46:57
But what's very important with transport

01:46:59
is that this definitely one of the fastest,

01:47:03
it's not the fastest rising contributor to emissions.

01:47:05
So every year increases the highest among all

01:47:07
the economic sectors globally.

01:47:10
So global climate problems are essentially

01:47:12
increasingly transport problems.

01:47:16
This is, let's say, we may not point of departure,

01:47:18
but one of the main reflections of this perspective

01:47:20
on the issue.

01:47:23
What also is very important is that,

01:47:25
as you see on the left hand side,

01:47:29
the global proportion of people living in urban communities

01:47:30
is rising.

01:47:35
So if in 2010, we were already after this magic

01:47:39
threshold of 50% or more of people living in cities

01:47:40
as opposed to the countryside.

01:47:48
In 2030, the projection is that it will be 60% of people living in cities and that will go up to at least 67 in 2050.

01:47:54
Of course, this is a mantra that I'm sure that at least those of you who follow the master in urban studies have already heard before.

01:48:03
We are living in urban society that's, you know, our planet is essentially an urban, an urban planet, planetary urbanization.

01:48:07
There's a lot of concepts flying around.

01:48:14
But it's important and it is a fact that increasingly the global population becoming more

01:48:19
and more urban, it's in the cities that a lot of these problems will have to be addressed.

01:48:23
So the urban mobility is not only that transport is crucial for solving the climate

01:48:28
crisis, but it's the urban transport that constitutes definitely a very important challenge

01:48:30
that has to be addressed.

01:48:36
So we see that as the right-hand side-craft, that urban mobility, the Manfob, and mobility

01:48:42
is rising almost exponentially. And that's expressed in trillions of kilometres per year here,

01:48:54
it rose from 2010 to 2030 by 68%. Now we might think that with all the reflection on externalities

01:49:01
that cars have, and produce the environmental and social aspects that are very detrimental to

01:49:09
to our lives, that we are moving away from the car. This is a perspective that we already had a short

01:49:14
charge on that. There is a shift. We start to look at urban spaces a little bit differently. We

01:49:20
want less cars to be present in it. But in fact on a global scale, if you look at the on the left

01:49:28
hand side as a cumulative figure, so the global number of all registered cars, the rise is ongoing

01:49:36
and it's huge. And that's also seen in the graph on the right hand side where we see

01:49:43
non-commulative yearly amount of cars being sold on a global scale. So we see that every year

01:49:49
the amount of cars being sold is rising 2019 being some sort of an exception. We have a little

01:49:56
bit of a drop. But what the graph doesn't not show is the amount of SUV, so the sports utility

01:50:01
vehicles they are called, which went through the roof in 2018 and 2019.

01:50:05
Their contribution environment is speaking much higher, a few times higher than regular

01:50:07
vehicles.

01:50:12
What also you can see over there is that in orange, if you see that the contribution, which

01:50:17
can call it this way of the European Union countries in terms of the number of cars sold,

01:50:19
is more or less stable.

01:50:22
So here we don't see an important price.

01:50:30
If you look at India in grey and in China in blue, here the difference between 2005 and

01:50:32
2019 is significant.

01:50:38
So there is a lot of economies, some call them developing economies, I'm not really a fan

01:50:44
of the word, but a lot of nation states, a lot of societies where the levels of motorizations

01:50:51
were relatively low and this commodity is definitely becoming more and more available.

01:50:56
It's not exactly the same process that was happening in Northern Europe or North America,

01:51:02
or Western Europe or North America in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, but it's definitely a

01:51:08
steep rise of modernization, of mobility levels, which raises a lot of environmental

01:51:15
questions, but also ethical issues in terms of whether this is something that we now

01:51:20
with our Western Northern ISA, looking at very critically, in fact, it's something that

01:51:23
these people, these societies have the right to engage in it.

01:51:25
As we did, it was our parents,

01:51:28
our grandparents did some decades ago.

01:51:31
But what is very important here,

01:51:32
I'm going to skip this one slide,

01:51:37
is that this debate, if we can put it this way, shifts its attention.

01:51:41
So we're moving away from the problem of congestion,

01:51:45
the problem of unobstructed flows,

01:51:49
the problem of rationality, the problem of economic development.

01:51:55
We see that this economic development has its environmental

01:51:57
price, if we can put it this way.

01:52:02
And a very important and very pertinent symbol of that mobility

01:52:04
and transport is the car.

01:52:09
As the important contributor to that cake, in terms

01:52:16
of pollution, in terms of externalities of transport.

01:52:21
And next time, so we still have a bit time for questions, maybe discussion,

01:52:27
we're going to talk about specific examples of how transport develops along this line of thought.

01:52:33
But, and I think it will be, well, it's definitely not the only thing we're going to do,

01:52:40
because as I will also explain in a week, that perspective also is extremely limited in its lack of

01:52:44
and social and also spatial understanding of the city.

01:52:47
So a simple critique of the car as the problem

01:52:51
is also leading us into a number of traps,

01:52:56
which mean that our understanding of how people enjoy

01:52:59
or do not enjoy mobility because of the class,

01:53:02
the gender, the ethnicity, and many other factors

01:53:04
is extremely limited.

01:53:08
So I put a little bit of a car here.

01:53:11
I wonder if you have any questions,

01:53:14
any points of discussion.

01:53:15
We still have 12 minutes,

01:53:17
so we might as well use them.

01:53:29
I might try to initiate a little discussion here

01:53:33
about popularity of cars and

01:53:38
endless mess that we are now seeing

01:53:43
of a lifestyle on high speed and etc.

01:53:51
I observed a curious thing that on TV in Belgium,

01:53:53
at least, I don't usually watch TV,

01:53:58
but I happened to watch 41 night with my friend

01:54:04
like a generic Belgium program.

01:54:09
during the advertisement period, all the odds,

01:54:14
a vast majority of them were about cars.

01:54:19
And in all ways, they were trying to sell either lifestyle,

01:54:26
a ecological idea that new cars can be in the green,

01:54:33
et cetera, but I was wondering if we might ever arrive

01:54:41
to this thinking that we should not be advertising this anymore,

01:54:50
as we don't advertise cigarettes or alcohol on TV and media,

01:54:54
in whether that makes sense or doesn't.

01:54:57
It's an interesting thought.

01:54:59
We will actually come back to it next time,

01:55:02
but they wonder if somebody has already, you know,

01:55:07
an opinion on this, should advertising cars

01:55:09
or sale cars should be banned because it's

01:55:11
but for society.

01:55:22
And we're going to give an ad to this

01:55:27
that I've been watching Belgian TV for a long time

01:55:28
as I'm saying, Belgian.

01:55:33
And there always used to be park commercials,

01:55:38
but in the last two years, actually most of them

01:55:45
have been for SUV cars, or like there's been a bit shift

01:55:49
to making commercials for SUV cars, which I

01:55:51
have found really strange.

01:55:59
Well, yeah, I think it's happening.

01:56:01
I was considering to put another graph

01:56:03
that shows the increase of SUV sales in the really,

01:56:06
maybe before 2015, it was,

01:56:07
this market hardly existed.

01:56:11
It really became a thing in the last two years,

01:56:14
at least in Western Europe.

01:56:15
I think it was a little bit different

01:56:18
in Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine,

01:56:24
some cultural reasons also really bad roads

01:56:26
and a lot of rich people.

01:56:32
But, okay, but that seems that if you tune in

01:56:34
to the mainstream culture, if you show TV

01:56:37
and advertising in between programs,

01:56:38
the cars are still very much there.

01:56:42
Well, maybe not regular cars, but more SUVs, as you say.

01:56:47
I think it's an interesting observation.

01:56:51
Anybody else has some thoughts on this or another things?

01:57:06
I think it would be quite hard to prohibit the advertisements if there's no real alternative

01:57:13
for the car, for example, in flanders, yeah, there's an extreme suburbanization and its

01:57:24
mobility is not that good to get to different places such as work or leisure. So yeah, I think first

01:57:30
a better alternative for the car needs to be installed. And what is that alternative?

01:57:42
Yeah, maybe better public transport, safer also in cities, but also in just down safer bicycle

01:57:44
lanes or, yeah.

01:57:51
And yes, like car sharing more,

01:57:53
if not really an alternative for cars,

01:57:58
it may be less having each household having two cars

01:57:59
or three.

01:58:02
And in Belgium, there's also the big problem

01:58:07
of the companies having giving cars to their employees,

01:58:12
which has sparked the bait.

01:58:16
Yes, in Belgium in fact,

01:58:18
most of new cars being sold,

01:58:20
a so-called company cars, which are

01:58:22
paid for by the,

01:58:23
I mean, for those who do not know

01:58:25
who are not from Belgium,

01:58:28
it's a system that allows you to get a free car

01:58:29
from your employer,

01:58:33
and it's basically a way of giving somebody a salary bump

01:58:37
because a tax free bonus,

01:58:39
if you increase somebody's salary,

01:58:46
would have to pay tax on this. You don't pay tax on the company car. But then why do you think

01:58:53
people, well, because it seems that I described some kind of a shift of thinking and some

01:58:58
reflection on these environmental problems that the corporate uses and all the new

01:59:03
senses that it causes, but it seems that people still drive. Why do you think they still do it?

01:59:07
Why is it still so popular?

01:59:14
Maybe I can refer to this. I think there's like

01:59:19
exactly what you were talking about before like certain

01:59:23
yeah certain

01:59:27
factors which which cannot be

01:59:38
somehow persist before like like our planners cannot um sorry um like you

01:59:42
certain things you cannot plan and like it's an individual approach that

01:59:47
the symbol of the car is still like deep in the mind of a lot of people that they

01:59:55
it's like a day routine that you get into your car and drive to the to your

02:00:03
working place. And I think that's exactly the problem that it's certain changes in the transportation

02:00:10
system cannot be made by planners or transport transportation planners, but have to be made in

02:00:19
in the society or in the symbolism of a car. So it's a mindset, it's some cultural

02:00:28
How do we choose sociologists would say that's a way of imagining how we interact with the world or how we move through it?

02:00:35
But I think the example of the company power also shows it something else. It's not exclusive. That is also a policy.

02:00:39
That there are a number of political instruments that make it.

02:00:48
I mean, if we go with that simplified logic of making a rational economic choice,

02:00:51
How do I go and what do I go?

02:00:55
It simply makes this decision more simple, more rational.

02:01:01
It makes sense to have a car from an economic perspective as well, in many cities still.

02:01:12
If I could maybe add to that also that's structurally, there is a lot of government as well,

02:01:18
policy support not just like the company cars, but as we saw these days with the crisis,

02:01:24
I think to try to boost, not to allow our automobile manufacturing, automobile companies,

02:01:29
crumble because of the employment opportunities that they provide. So,

02:01:35
strangely enough, actually some of the financial loss or some of the new

02:01:42
funds for the stimulate the economy have been directly towards individual car owners

02:01:49
purchase of different people. So I think when you when you see that it's

02:01:55
being imperative a big push if you can have access to that as well.

02:02:00
Yeah. I think singles with aviation, I don't know if you follow the London news, but

02:02:05
one of the first, maybe not first, but one of the only discussions in terms of some economic

02:02:11
package for stimulating the economy in Belgium was towards the aviation companies.

02:02:17
The argument being is that these industries create jobs and these jobs are valuable.

02:02:21
Well, I'm not saying whether this is right or wrong,

02:02:27
but the argument is there that these modes of mobility also produce employment.

02:02:33
I think that relates a little bit to this aspect of economic development, this anticipation,

02:02:39
that this way of moving around our cities or societies in general is very important for the economy

02:02:43
to keep growing, to keep persisting.

02:02:49
Are there any other comments? We're from some people who haven't spoken yet.

02:02:51
Do you have some thoughts?

02:02:53
Some comments?

02:03:00
I was also thinking about security. The use of the car is still

02:03:08
Like, yeah, done by many because maybe it's the most secure way of moving around in some cities.

02:03:14
And also, like, as I'm thinking, like, as a woman, as a girl, like, moving around the city at night,

02:03:19
usually like, I mean, not here in Brussels because I don't have a car here in Brussels, like, back home.

02:03:28
I would go by car at night. Just because like, yeah, it's not very secure to move around with,

02:03:34
like probably transport or even by bike. So I would say like yeah it's a matter of security as well.

02:03:43
And it's more like a structure problem to change so I guess more steps have to be taken in that sense.

02:03:51
Yeah it's a very good point. It's existed before the pandemic and now it's become even more

02:03:59
more of an issue. So any data shows us that, especially the upper middle class or upper class

02:04:06
people have bought themselves a new car to separate themselves from the danger of interacting with

02:04:11
others. And this danger would be related to maybe criminality or general lack of safety, especially

02:04:17
at night, especially for women perhaps. But now this sense of danger and the car is this kind of

02:04:24
bubble that allows you to separate yourself from whatever danger society holds, it's even stronger.

02:04:34
I think what's important also, we will talk about this a lot next time, is that this goes

02:04:40
very differently for different people. I mean it sounds very obvious, but whether you look at

02:04:44
the situation from a class perspective or from a gender perspective or from a racial perspective,

02:04:49
I think all these three also ages very important. All these four then

02:04:55
the blind person is very much. The way that people arrive through a decision in terms of

02:05:00
why they go where they go and how they go, it's very different from cluster class from

02:05:08
gendered gender etc etc. So this homo-economic paradigm is extremely problematic there.

02:05:17
But so is, I hope I will convince you of that, this direct critique of the car,

02:05:23
because different people use the car for different reasons. And not always, it's an individual choice,

02:05:30
but also there are some structural issues that play, also indeed, some cultural inertia,

02:05:38
some ways of being that were installed and promoted for decades, which now we are of some of us.

02:05:46
living in city centres, critical of things are quite different if you're from a

02:05:51
different class and living in different areas of the city. I don't mind taking one

02:05:55
more or two more questions but it's age already so we are very free to leave

02:06:00
if you want to. I don't want to take too much of your time.

02:06:05
Well, great.

02:06:09
I'm glad this is working from the technical perspective at least.

02:06:13
Yeah, I will see you next week.

02:06:16
Can I add a last question?

02:06:17
Yeah, yeah.

02:06:21
The last question about the excursion that we have program.

02:06:25
I know that in COVID times, well, it's not happening.

02:06:28
No, no, I was told that, yeah,

02:06:33
was trying to do it, but it's not possible, unfortunately.

02:06:34
I wish we could do it.

02:06:37
The idea is for those of you who are in Brussels next semester,

02:06:39
but all of you will be, right?

02:06:49
Well, I mean, let's say, well, we don't know, of course,

02:06:50
what happens in a few months.

02:06:54
But the idea is that if in spring, we are more or less

02:06:57
to more into face-to-face meetings,

02:07:02
we do the excursion then. We imagined with David Bas another is what would happen if we meet with

02:07:07
40 people and tried to keep distance. I think this would you know we would hit YouTube very quickly

02:07:14
I think trying to walk through the city in this arrangement. So no and also in December I mean it

02:07:20
would be very strange. From ice greens in the end we would definitely try to keep together

02:07:26
just to keep warm. It's cold right? So we will do that in spring I hope. It's a nice excursion.

02:07:33
from what I've heard. People usually enjoy it. Even though it's only about transport.

02:07:41
But yeah, I'm sorry about that. I wish we could do it. Yeah, this is the reality we're living in.

02:07:49
I hope you've got a great rest of the week. I'll see you all next week. The links are there,

02:07:53
So it seems that everything is clear and working. So that's brilliant.

02:07:58
Enjoy and have a good, have a good week.

02:08:00
Thank you for the lecture.

02:08:04
Thank you very much. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.

# 9 Critical perspectives on urban transport

00:00:03
to be recording automatically, but it is now.

00:00:06
Thanks for reminding me.

00:00:10
So double rationality, the rationality of the discipline,

00:00:16
which is taken as some kind of field

00:00:21
deriving from natural sciences, alluding to laws of physics,

00:00:25
which apparently help to understand where people go,

00:00:28
how they move around the city.

00:00:30
and the rationality of the people themselves,

00:00:33
of the users, of passengers, drivers,

00:00:36
who make rational, economic choices

00:00:38
in terms of where they go, how they go.

00:00:41
How does this apply to the city?

00:00:45
Well, basically the city's approach as a clean slate.

00:00:49
So it's social, political, spatial complexity.

00:00:52
It's seen, if it is seen, it's seen as an obstacle

00:00:55
to these principles of rational planning.

00:00:58
If it's not seen, then basically, well,

00:01:02
this planning is applied as if on a clean slate,

00:01:04
which in this particular slide,

00:01:06
maybe this is a bit of an exaggeration.

00:01:07
He's a plant from the Copusia,

00:01:10
who was really very back then,

00:01:11
and was called the Boul, the courageous,

00:01:14
in terms of proposing to actually

00:01:17
demolish all the neighborhoods

00:01:21
or all cities to give way to this rational modern planning.

00:01:25
But a lot of these planning principles have been applied,

00:01:28
I'm sure that you've been to, maybe even lived in cities

00:01:31
where whole neighborhoods, if not whole cities,

00:01:32
have been designed according to this principle

00:01:35
of rationality, speed, modernity.

00:01:39
That of course focused on, or framed the car,

00:01:42
the private vehicle as the ultimate,

00:01:45
most rational, most liberating mode of mobility,

00:01:46
mode of transport.

00:01:52
We also arrived last time to this growing reflection,

00:01:58
starting from the 1970s and then through the 1980s and 1990s,

00:02:01
on many different problems related to car

00:02:02
and automobileities.

00:02:07
So there's wider social phenomenon related

00:02:11
to a classification and commodification of private cars.

00:02:14
So a lot of social issues have been raised

00:02:16
and primarily environmental issues,

00:02:19
second-rate with regards to automobileity

00:02:20
with regard to the car.

00:02:23
And to be frank,

00:02:31
I think in a lot of transport debates, whether in academia or on activism or in policy,

00:02:34
you in Brussels I think is quite apparent in many other Belgian cities too.

00:02:35
This is where we are.

00:02:40
This is still very much the dominant paradigm in terms of how policy is being framed and

00:02:42
how research is being done.

00:02:48
Paris considered to be something detrimental to the quality of urban space, to living,

00:02:50
because of its environmental effects,

00:02:54
the pollution, noise, accidents, that it causes,

00:02:57
it's a very dangerous mode of transport.

00:02:59
For those, of course, who are outside of the car

00:03:01
and clash, collide with it.

00:03:03
Or it's spatial footprints, right?

00:03:07
So the spatial impact of the infrastructure,

00:03:10
the amount of square meters that have to be devoted

00:03:11
to this particular mode of transport,

00:03:16
nor the for it, to be able to move around the city.

00:03:17
So I'm thinking here,

00:03:19
but all there have been multiple ways, the parking lots,

00:03:21
junctions and all that that has to be present

00:03:26
in the city for the car to be a valid,

00:03:29
useful of moving around.

00:03:31
So this is what we did last time.

00:03:35
A bit of an, I'm not an introvert,

00:03:37
but what happened also,

00:03:39
throughout the 1970s and '80s,

00:03:41
is that in the global north, at least,

00:03:43
in so-called developed countries,

00:03:47
such as Belgium, but also across the point in North America.

00:03:51
Cities have entered into a post-40s era,

00:03:53
and I'm sure this has been covered a lot by David

00:03:55
and probably a little bit by Nick.

00:03:57
And here I'm going to focus much more

00:03:59
on the transport related impact of that shift.

00:04:02
Of course, it was not something that happened over a day

00:04:05
and it's difficult to tell or to pinpoint

00:04:10
when did 40 cities conclude the existence,

00:04:13
and we moved to post-40 and there's more of a longer process

00:04:15
that happened over a long period of time,

00:04:18
at least a couple of years, if not decades.

00:04:21
But what's very important there is that if you go back

00:04:25
to these curves and that are somewhat similar

00:04:29
to the contractives, waves of different innovation waves.

00:04:32
1960s, '70s and '80s brought first the innovation

00:04:36
and then the massification, the spread of ICT technology.

00:04:39
So different modes of different instruments

00:04:42
of telecommunication, and also a big development

00:04:47
of aviation of air, which was used both.

00:04:49
I mean, of course, it existed already in 1930s,

00:04:52
40s and 50s, but it's in the 1970s

00:04:56
that it really became a common or more common than ever

00:04:59
way for people to move around to travel, of course,

00:05:03
not within the city, but between cities and countries,

00:05:05
and also to move goods.

00:05:10
So this really propelled or gave constitute

00:05:16
a really big step in terms of globalizing both traffic of people as an of goods or trade.

00:05:23
And that's coincided with a general shift from industrial to service economy,

00:05:29
ongoing sub-organization of not only housing but also a number of other economic functions that

00:05:34
were traditionally related to them because also moved to the suburbs, which created

00:05:41
polycentric mosaic-like patterns of suburbanization. So the suburbs were no longer

00:05:45
these residential areas from which people committed to the city center, but actually a lot of jobs,

00:05:52
a lot of productive activity and service economy would start being located in the suburbs themselves.

00:05:59
So creating all kinds of constellations, which for example could be called the suburban downtown,

00:06:03
so H-Cities that comes from the work of a famous job of a soldier,

00:06:07
analyzing the development of Los Angeles in the 1980s and the 1990s.

00:06:17
The paradigm of this could be seen, I mean, or the symbol, not a paradigm of this transformation

00:06:23
could be seen in the particular space or a type of space of an airport. If back in the 1970s,

00:06:28
as you can see in this image, the airport would be a very functional place, a place of arrival,

00:06:36
the departure and around the small area would be devoted to the airport. This over, of course,

00:06:41
a number of decades has completely changed. So you see that development of one of the most

00:06:48
important efforts in the world's people, which is the airport of Amsterdam. What's very important

00:06:54
here is that the airport is no longer in addition to the city but actually increasingly a central

00:06:59
space around which or in relation to which the city develops.

00:07:03
So what kind of a city has, what kind of an upwards city has,

00:07:06
has repercussions in terms of what kind of class of investors

00:07:09
and productive activities it can attract.

00:07:13
To have an important airport hub is increasingly

00:07:16
only, well, it's already a well-established point

00:07:19
of the agenda of open marketing of open development.

00:07:22
And airports are no longer just airports.

00:07:25
when you can see here in the slide that around C-pop,

00:07:27
we've got a number of other activities.

00:07:32
So business district, office spaces, residential hotel.

00:07:36
So it is sort of neighborhood in itself

00:07:40
that is built around the airport itself.

00:07:45
This is important, why is it important?

00:07:48
Well, there is a number of things at stake here,

00:07:51
but the most important thing here is that this change

00:07:54
of typology of different spaces and relation to these different modes of travel.

00:08:01
So, coming into telecommunications, aviation means that travel patterns are becoming more

00:08:02
and more complex.

00:08:09
The globalization of world economy and the centrality of the city and global economy means

00:08:15
that there is a number of productive activities jobs basically that have in 24/7.

00:08:20
It's the paradigm of going to, I mean, of most people going to work at eight o'clock,

00:08:24
in the morning and then going back in the afternoon, of course, it's a lot of people still

00:08:29
do that, but there is plenty of jobs that happen overnight that require transporting

00:08:36
infrastructure that is provided in places and at times that were not needed, there was no

00:08:44
demand for in the past. So in other words, this making of the urban economy more flexible

00:08:49
and more precarious has repercussions in terms of making transport and mobility also much

00:08:53
much more flexible or the demand for, much more flexible,

00:08:57
way of moving, which of course means that it's way more complicated and way more difficult

00:09:00
to design transport systems than before.

00:09:05
Since people move, if we can put it in a very blunt way, in much more complicated ways than

00:09:09
ever before, at very different times, in different spaces.

00:09:12
Just to give you an example, I mean, traditionally, there's haven't been, so the

00:09:16
airport of Brussels will be considered, of course, as a very important space that had to

00:09:20
be connected to the city, primarily to receive passengers

00:09:21
there and from.

00:09:24
And increasingly, around that area of the city--

00:09:27
and I think you covered that with David, quite in detail--

00:09:30
there is a whole hub of business and productive activity,

00:09:33
which of course attracts a lot of middle class workers

00:09:36
who would go to that area daytime.

00:09:39
But then the development of the city--

00:09:40
sorry, of the airport--

00:09:43
means that there is a high demand for workers

00:09:44
and logistics, for example.

00:09:51
I have to arrive at the airport at 3 o'clock in the morning, which raises questions in terms of provision of public transport to the area.

00:09:55
A lot of these people would, for example, reside in working-class neighborhoods of Brussels.

00:10:01
So there is a question where the night-time public transport should be provided to the area,

00:10:07
but then get the current paradigm of public transport by nighttime in Brussels.

00:10:10
This mode of transport is mostly provided for leisure activities.

00:10:14
So for people who go out and enjoy cultural activities

00:10:16
or socializing and want to go back home

00:10:18
and do a clock three o'clock in the night.

00:10:20
But not for people who actually need to reach

00:10:24
they jobs at that time of the night.

00:10:28
In very, let's say weird or previously

00:10:31
not so present areas such as the sub-item area

00:10:35
or other locala fees around that and that's not that hard.

00:10:37
Okay.

00:10:40
So having said this,

00:10:42
So a quick reminder of what we did last time

00:10:47
and a quick cover of this shift from four this to post four

00:10:50
is the paradigm of urban development

00:10:52
and its repercussions for the cities

00:10:55
and transport in them.

00:10:57
Here's what we are going to do today.

00:11:02
So we will discuss perhaps have a little discussion.

00:11:04
Actually, I'll be trying to ask you some questions

00:11:07
and engage in some exchange here.

00:11:09
What is the sustainable urban transport

00:11:14
different sustainable perspectives on imagining transport and developing it.

00:11:20
And then we will engage in a progressive deconstructing of the paradigm and analyze what we

00:11:24
can identify as critical approaches to transport it, mobility that built on a number of

00:11:30
perspectives that you already heard from David and Bass and Nick about.

00:11:32
All right.

00:11:36
Last week, what you had to do, and many other things that are done out of you had to do

00:11:39
with students of Master of Nursing Studies and Geography,

00:11:42
is to read paper by David Bannister on Sustainable Mobility

00:11:44
Partly.

00:11:46
I wonder whether you still remember anything from that paper.

00:11:50
This is not an exam, so don't worry if you remember things

00:11:53
that were not exactly what you remember,

00:11:56
but it's exactly clear, maybe things a little bit fuzzy.

00:12:00
But does something ring a bell from that piece?

00:12:03
If somebody asked you today before this particular lecture,

00:12:06
what is sustainable urban transport?

00:12:07
What comes to mind?

00:12:10
Does anybody want to share the thoughts on this with us?

00:12:19
That's a cool look with silence.

00:12:25
Come on, does anybody remember what

00:12:26
a banister says in this paper?

00:12:32
That's all right.

00:12:40
Okay, well, it's not how to put it.

00:12:44
It's not the most fascinating paper I've ever read,

00:12:48
but for transport geography, it's absolutely fundamental.

00:12:51
So this is really something that you see being referred

00:12:54
to for what was it written 2011, right?

00:12:58
So nine years in this is still a very, very important piece

00:13:02
of writing that really defined almost a whole field

00:13:06
of research and transport in mobility.

00:13:10
What's important here-- and this is important when

00:13:12
we keep thinking about the last lecture

00:13:17
in the neoclassical paradigm of developing transport--

00:13:20
is, well, could be summarized in the number of parts.

00:13:23
So if you think about this image that I showed you

00:13:27
from the corpus year, and this modernist rational approach

00:13:29
to planning cities around transport,

00:13:35
Here, the assumption is that we have to ultimately break with the small

00:13:40
function of planning, separation of functions, keeping residential areas on the one side,

00:13:45
and productive activity jobs, offices, industrial activity,

00:13:48
on the other side, and then leisure somewhere in between these three,

00:13:51
in between these two. Here, the idea is that we really have to

00:13:57
engage in planning cities that are much more mixed, which different functions are

00:14:05
allocated much more closely to each other. Why do we have to do that? Well, because this increases

00:14:13
a possibility of engaging less in mobility, of basically moving less in the city, which has of course

00:14:17
very good implications or potentially good implications in terms of the environmental impact of

00:14:22
transport. So the idea is that if we make cities more mixed, in terms of the functions, and on

00:14:28
top of that more dense, we might arrive at a situation in which people don't have to travel such

00:14:31
for our distances, all they don't have to travel that often.

00:14:33
And potentially, and that's the second point,

00:14:36
we can also facilitate some kind of a shift

00:14:39
from the mode that we all want to disappear.

00:14:42
I'm thinking as a sustainable urban transport plan

00:14:43
right now.

00:14:47
So the car towards public transport, collective mobility,

00:14:50
on the one hand, and on the other hand,

00:14:51
so-called soft transport mode.

00:14:55
So walking, cycling, to profoundly challenge

00:14:58
and hopefully end the domination of class in cities.

00:15:03
So this is, it goes beyond the critique of the car.

00:15:06
How do we, maybe not get rid of the car,

00:15:09
but how do we limit its presence?

00:15:11
Well, we make cities more dense, more mixed,

00:15:13
and we make public transport

00:15:16
and other different modes of moving around more attractive.

00:15:19
Well, of course, there are important cultural

00:15:21
and social barriers to this.

00:15:23
So there is some kind of social inertia

00:15:26
and you mentioned it in our discussion at the end of the last lecture,

00:15:28
people are used to driving.

00:15:31
They, of course, had been also told for a couple of decades.

00:15:35
Now that I mean buying a car is something not only perfectly normal,

00:15:39
but maybe in context such as Belgium or Brussels,

00:15:41
a perfectly rational choice.

00:15:44
Also, well, if we follow the neoclassical line,

00:15:47
I mean people make rational economic choices.

00:15:53
It's been simply quite profitable and economically reasonable to have a car.

00:15:57
So to instigate some kind of a social transformation,

00:16:00
we need to pay more attention to how people make these choices.

00:16:05
And this perspective starts adding a number of psychological analysis, for example,

00:16:12
in fact, to this equation. So it's not only an economic choice in some kind of an economic

00:16:16
decision that people make when they take a car or some other amount of transport,

00:16:23
But there's also different social aspects, psychological aspects that impact,

00:16:28
that make an impact on this. And this means that sustainable urban transport scholars, planners,

00:16:34
activists are much more attentive than the neoclassical colleagues in terms of how people

00:16:38
engage in different lifestyles, why do they practice certain travel behaviors that is called,

00:16:45
which also leads to a lot of studies on inclusion and transport or exclusion from it on accessibility,

00:16:48
the two different transport modes or accessibility

00:16:51
through transport to different urban functions,

00:16:56
which progressively over the 1990s, 2000s,

00:16:59
and after today, questions this paradigm of seems

00:17:03
to question this paradigm of top down planning and policy.

00:17:06
So this figure of some neoclassical rational expert

00:17:09
is not necessarily what it's still there,

00:17:12
but it's not the only god-like figure

00:17:15
that made these liquor who see a life decisions

00:17:18
in terms of, here we will go the motorway,

00:17:21
and here we will build some residential neighborhood

00:17:22
et cetera et cetera.

00:17:27
Where is the city in this paradigm or in this perspective?

00:17:32
Well, the city is an outcome of the sustainable

00:17:35
transport paradigm.

00:17:39
It's a sustainable transport in sustainable city

00:17:46
is an integral component of what Jacob's calls good city

00:17:49
or what David Bannister in the article he had to read,

00:17:54
identifies as urban viability, vibrancy, vitality.

00:18:00
There is a lot of words about a lot of writing about

00:18:04
the attractiveness of the city or its livability

00:18:06
or its resilience, that's a bit more recent.

00:18:11
So there's a lot of keywords which identify a city as

00:18:15
ultimate benefactor of this shift

00:18:16
towards sustainable transport.

00:18:20
So there is talk about maintaining economic performance

00:18:22
of the city since, well, we remember that

00:18:24
new classical scholars have essentially tried

00:18:27
to theorize this relationship between economic growth

00:18:29
and development of transport.

00:18:30
So it's still there.

00:18:31
We move away from the carbon.

00:18:33
So the cities still continue to develop.

00:18:35
The economy is continue to thrive.

00:18:39
which you've social cohesion so presumably everybody is on board,

00:18:41
there is no loses of this process.

00:18:43
It's all, of course, environmentally friendly.

00:18:47
We arrive at urban environments which provide better health

00:18:51
environments or not facilities, but basically more healthy

00:18:53
for the residents.

00:18:55
And all this in the spirit of participation,

00:18:59
so everybody is on board and this political process

00:19:02
does not exclude anybody.

00:19:05
Well, if you think about this, I mean,

00:19:09
I'm, no, my intention is not to be ironic here.

00:19:11
I think that, by the way, the slide,

00:19:14
I mean, the image here is from this visualization

00:19:17
of Boula Varnspak in Brussels,

00:19:21
so the central avenue that crosses the Pentagon

00:19:22
from North to South.

00:19:25
And if you remember how this street looked like

00:19:28
some years ago, this kind of vision is something

00:19:31
that we might all want to subscribe to.

00:19:36
I mean, who doesn't want to live in a city that is all these things economically performing

00:19:38
and socially cohesive environment friendly?

00:19:41
I mean, it's a perfect city to see.

00:19:47
The problem is, well, before we move to the problem, there are a few.

00:19:50
I'm sure that this rings a bell, and I'm sure that you know a lot of different practices

00:19:55
which are trying to policies, practices that are trying to achieve these things to make

00:20:00
the city more environmentally friendly in terms of its transport, economic performance,

00:20:06
inclusive, cohesive and whatnot. I am curious what examples you know. So this is maybe an

00:20:13
easy question to answer compared to the previous one. Does anybody know any practices of sustainable

00:20:15
transport, basically? Is it my question?

00:20:24
Could you consider the construction of bike lanes, for example?

00:20:32
Yes, very much so. I mean, it's promoting a different mode of transport than the cars, right?

00:20:35
One of the soft modes cycling. So we absolutely yes.

00:20:38
What else?

00:20:45
I see it, Antwerp. I'm leaving

00:20:51
here next to it, about 1 kilometer of the opera in Antwerp.

00:21:01
And two years ago, it was for passengers.

00:21:03
Very difficult to cross the roads.

00:21:07
And now they made a tunnel.

00:21:11
And they made a huge space for COVID transport and passengers.

00:21:19
So you can see now, and then a big difference,

00:21:24
a clear division from what's what's unusual until the 90s.

00:21:30
So you mean that there was less space of well, the current

00:21:31
for starting to be a

00:21:35
is now the human life by public transport to the world.

00:21:36
Yeah.

00:21:39
The the car was still

00:21:42
like they said it was the boss.

00:21:44
Right.

00:21:48
of the car was very important.

00:21:51
We see now we shift there.

00:21:56
And the shift basically consists of creating some infrastructure for pedestrians

00:21:59
and public transport to somehow buy.

00:22:03
Now for a meeting place for the opera.

00:22:05
Okay, okay.

00:22:07
Okay, very often.

00:22:09
Just to this.

00:22:11
Can you hear him?

00:22:16
Yeah, I just just right before the lecture I read about Paris with a more

00:22:19
restrictive policy about banning

00:22:27
There are parking spots in cities in in order to achieve the 50 minutes city the so-called

00:22:31
Human city air right so restricting

00:22:39
Restructing current infrastructure or transforming it into different type of infrastructure for either either different modes or for pedestrians

00:22:43
So creating some urban space, okay.

00:22:45
What else?

00:22:48
Maybe developing bus rapid transit.

00:22:50
That's not all that in America.

00:22:54
Yeah. Does everybody, or is this somebody who doesn't know what bus rapid transit is?

00:23:01
It's a funny question to ask to a screen, but, oh, you know,

00:23:04
we don't tell me that it's switched again.

00:23:08
I have to stop sharing this screen, but perhaps you want to explain what bus rapid transit is,

00:23:11
I'm sure that there is somebody who doesn't know.

00:23:16
I can help in case your definition is not perfect.

00:23:18
Well, what it has.

00:23:25
Yeah, you know, what I have as an example is this lanes that they're just for bosses.

00:23:31
So they're developed a rapid lane that it will only go for bosses.

00:23:34
It's supposed to work better around the city.

00:23:53
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's essentially creating separate lanes for buses, but what's quite specific about this or quite particular is that it kind of imitates or replaces an underground system, so a metro system, which is of course very expensive to build.

00:24:03
So the idea is that instead of engaging in all this digging and creating this very costly and invasive infrastructure, you can just create some separate lanes for the buses and have an efficient.

00:24:07
public transport system which is metro like.

00:24:13
And that's, I want to say common, but well, a lot of cases first emerge in the global

00:24:14
south, right?

00:24:19
So in South America and in South Africa, but there are also cases in global, in

00:24:21
the global north and western European.

00:24:29
Okay, there is a lot of these different policies and a lot of different, a lot of different

00:24:30
practices and ideas.

00:24:31
It seems.

00:24:36
So let's quickly go over, let's try to put them together

00:24:41
into some kind of coherent typology of different things

00:24:44
that cities can do in order to make this transport

00:24:45
more sustainable.

00:24:47
So the first thing is to tackle the problem, right?

00:24:51
So if the problem is the car, then how do we deal with the car?

00:24:54
Well, we can either improve the technology of the car.

00:24:57
And this means reducing emissions,

00:25:00
making it contaminate the little bit less.

00:25:03
So cleaning the engine technology,

00:25:05
substituting for of petrol,

00:25:08
these are vehicles by electric vehicles or biogas,

00:25:10
or whatnot.

00:25:13
Creating the construction of cars

00:25:17
so that they cause less casualties in case of accidents.

00:25:20
So this is something that today we take for granted

00:25:23
that cars have these crash zones

00:25:25
and crashes are being done in safety tests.

00:25:28
But this was virtually non-existent in the 1970s or '80s.

00:25:30
So that's one thing.

00:25:32
So basically it's trying to make the car

00:25:34
a better vehicle for the city.

00:25:37
Well, here, the immediate problem is that I mentioned

00:25:40
that last time among the type of vehicles

00:25:44
that see the number of sales go up.

00:25:47
Most, I mean, most rapidly in the last two or three years,

00:25:49
our SUVs, the sports utility vehicles,

00:25:53
which are basically these massive Jeep-like cars

00:25:55
which are extremely dangerous for pedestrians.

00:25:58
And if you also turn to one of the most important

00:26:03
or marketised inventors of transport technology, Elon Musk.

00:26:07
I mean, it's a guy who does electric cars, but also if you paid attention to that,

00:26:10
I don't know if you noticed that in the news.

00:26:14
I think it was early this year or last year that he produced this massive truck,

00:26:21
like American style pickup truck, which has not been tested in terms of its impact on

00:26:26
pedestrians in case it actually clashes with one. But there is, on the one hand, the industry

00:26:31
tries to reinvent the vehicles to make them more safe and very many friendly. On the other hand,

00:26:37
there is still a push for creating gigantic vehicles which simply cannot achieve that with the size

00:26:43
and the you know it's audience or the audience not simply looking for this. Okay so that's the car.

00:26:47
And the other thing that of course can be done is to restrict the accessibility for the car

00:26:55
to the city as a whole or to its different area specific zones right. So we can

00:27:00
And for example, imposed these destructive pricing instruments,

00:27:02
such as congestion charging or perage,

00:27:05
which was a more stud stolen and Dutch,

00:27:07
which was very recently announced in Brussels,

00:27:11
but it existed in several other Belgian cities

00:27:15
in one form or another for quite a while now.

00:27:18
We can think of reducing physically the space for the car,

00:27:21
so basically making roads more narrow,

00:27:24
so cutting some lanes,

00:27:26
reducing the number of parking areas.

00:27:30
And then, as it was mentioned earlier,

00:27:31
replacing this infrastructure,

00:27:34
replacing this space with other uses.

00:27:36
So opening this space, too, for example,

00:27:38
pedestrians will non-motorize traffic,

00:27:40
creating these so-called pedestrian zones,

00:27:42
or shared spaces.

00:27:45
And here have one from London in this slide.

00:27:48
And also, the famous congestion charging steam in London,

00:27:52
which means that in a specific central area of London,

00:27:56
you pay 12 pounds to enter every time you do that, right?

00:28:01
Okay, what other things can be done

00:28:02
to tackle a lot of mobility?

00:28:06
Well, of course, if we want the presence of the car to go down,

00:28:09
we need to propose some alternative to the car.

00:28:12
Our obvious alternative is public transport,

00:28:15
and here's sustainable perspectives on transport basically

00:28:18
keep emphasizing the importance of increasing the quality

00:28:19
of public transport,

00:28:24
increasing the accessibility of public transport across the urban or suburban space.

00:28:30
And indeed, faster rapid transit is one common example of how this can be done actually

00:28:36
quite inexpensively. Also, the reinstallational urban trumps in many cities in the global north

00:28:42
that got rid of the tram to create space for the car. If you remember my slides from last

00:28:48
time, that's what partly happened in Brussels in the 1970s. It's a very common way. It was a very

00:28:52
common phenomenon, common phenomenon, sorry. In France where a lot of cities,

00:28:58
tramphet work was quite simply dismantled. So here, since the 1990s, 2000s,

00:29:02
we see the return of the tramp. Urban for the finicular, so gradient,

00:29:06
skable cars, plenty of other modes, basically, of public transport. And also

00:29:11
promoting the notion of multi-modality, right? So creating different options for

00:29:15
users so that they don't have to simply choose between the car and something else,

00:29:20
but there's something else is a variety of different options from which one can choose,

00:29:27
depending on where they go with whom, what they feel like using in a particular moment of time,

00:29:33
what corresponds better to the behavior to the lifestyle, right? If the lifestyle and behavior

00:29:42
is what we pay attention to much more than before. And then finally, what's important in this

00:29:45
and port volume of different solutions or tools,

00:29:48
if you will, is reducing the need to travel.

00:29:50
So I mentioned already that here the idea

00:29:53
is that we make cities more dense, more mixed.

00:29:56
So perhaps we don't have to travel so often and so far.

00:30:01
And in planning for geography,

00:30:04
the idea here is to progressively

00:30:07
linked urban development with transport development.

00:30:09
So the idea of transit oriented or transport

00:30:13
the development emerged within this paradigm.

00:30:15
So for example, fostering some activities

00:30:17
and development around the development

00:30:19
of new metro stations or railway stations

00:30:21
or whole transport corridors.

00:30:23
A little bit like what I showed you last time

00:30:24
with COVID-19, right?

00:30:26
The finger, the five finger plan,

00:30:28
which was one of the first ideas

00:30:30
of linking transport development

00:30:31
at urban development.

00:30:35
And many other things that, well, quite frankly,

00:30:38
I'm much more interested in sharing with you

00:30:41
the critique of all this, then this itself.

00:30:45
Because this is very easy to find this plenty

00:30:46
of different publications on this.

00:30:50
I mean, basically, if you follow any of these websites

00:30:53
which deal with, well, these are called magazine

00:30:56
these days, follow urban policy, city lab,

00:31:00
the Atlantic, Fox, or whatnot, sure that you know

00:31:00
more than I do.

00:31:02
I mean, this is what they say.

00:31:04
I mean, this is what they promote a lot, right?

00:31:06
So the car is the problem.

00:31:11
So any time a big northern, also in the global south,

00:31:12
this is picked up a little bit.

00:31:13
But any time any city,

00:31:16
an important city does something in terms of curving

00:31:17
or vulnerability,

00:31:21
this is very often picked up at this kind of media

00:31:24
and hailed as a radical intervention,

00:31:27
as a radical step to reinvent the ability

00:31:29
to give cities back to the people,

00:31:32
to make cities more sustainable green attractive,

00:31:33
et cetera, et cetera.

00:31:35
Now, I'm not saying that this is all bad

00:31:38
and that this is problematic in itself.

00:31:40
But there is a number of critical questions

00:31:42
that ask us critical geographers

00:31:44
really need to be asking about these practices,

00:31:47
because they're quite simply, well,

00:31:49
they are not really taking full stock

00:31:51
of the complexity of cities that they're being applied

00:31:54
for one.

00:31:58
So, well, the first immediate problem

00:32:00
is that the word sustainability

00:32:03
or the term sustainability has already been picked up

00:32:08
by the industry, the paradigm, that sustainability,

00:32:11
in principle, wanted to criticize

00:32:15
and to have some critical cutting edge over.

00:32:19
So for instance, the oil industry

00:32:23
and the current industry, both claim to be extremely sustainable

00:32:26
these days, in terms of how they produce soil,

00:32:27
and in terms of how they produce vehicles.

00:32:30
I mentioned already this idea of reinventing the car,

00:32:35
which is a more sustainable mode of travel in cities.

00:32:38
But the deeper problem is that, and I will show that in a moment,

00:32:44
that the kind of questions that sustainable urban paradigm asks about the city

00:32:48
and the solutions that it tries to bring are essentially,

00:32:53
I mean, they can only reveal some transport reality to a point.

00:32:57
So it's very quick, I think, that we can read some kind of a wall.

00:33:01
And this debate between, let's say, the neoclassical engineers

00:33:04
and economists and the anti-car proponents

00:33:09
of sustainable uponities is not a very productive one.

00:33:12
And very importantly for this course said, for you,

00:33:13
as I don't know, I've been geographers

00:33:15
for a certain planet of the future,

00:33:18
the relation between transport and the urban in this debate

00:33:20
is very weak.

00:33:24
So conceptually, but also empirically,

00:33:26
this kind of thinking about transport and mobility

00:33:30
simply does not tell us a lot, I think, about the city,

00:33:32
which is why we're here tonight.

00:33:35
Right, so, though let's be constructed

00:33:39
and explore some critical stuff about it basically.

00:33:43
So, I wonder whether you can already pick up

00:33:45
some critique of this from Elena Vania

00:33:47
in her colleague, T. Riebrenak.

00:33:52
I'll be stubborn with the readings today.

00:33:56
Does anybody remember something from the reading for today?

00:34:00
I do.

00:34:12
It's been, since I read it, but I know that she has like identified two main principles

00:34:21
of critique, which is first that the alternatives that are being proposed by the automobile

00:34:29
industry and no specific plans, they are not very like sufficient and reducing the

00:34:40
out to mobile impact in certain cases. You can say something wrong and then secondly,

00:34:50
well it's sort of a very exclusive sometimes discussion I think, but yeah,

00:34:58
I it's not very present anymore, but I would like to pose another question for that paper. It kind of upset me anyway.

00:34:58
Oh yeah.

00:35:01
You can do it right now.

00:35:02
Okay.

00:35:04
Well, go ahead.

00:35:16
Yeah, if we're at it, like I basically I liked her way of like introducing her thoughts and like structuring the paper, but I was a bit like put off just

00:35:30
methodologically in the way that she links empirical evidence that she produced herself to theory

00:35:44
that is oftentimes very theoretical and based on very personal beliefs and attitudes which I

00:35:50
like also support in a way, but sometimes I found that did make her arguments less striking,

00:35:54
and I was just wondering because we are like still in the beginning of all of our

00:36:03
like urban critical research careers, how that is to be done.

00:36:07
If you have an answer to that.

00:36:11
I don't know. I mean, I don't have an answer to that question.

00:36:17
Well, I would agree with you that maybe methodologically this is not the strongest paper.

00:36:22
It's an analysis of plans and it's not very clear exactly what she's made with this.

00:36:26
Maybe it's true that her convictions are a little bit stronger than her in periods. In this

00:36:33
particular paper, I picked it because it's summarises a few things a little bit better than others.

00:36:40
But I really like what she does, even though the best work that she's done in French,

00:36:44
I think which makes it not accessible to everybody here.

00:36:50
But yeah, I think your first point in terms of what's in the article,

00:36:54
it's spot on. It's also there in the title. I mean, she maybe,

00:36:59
again, she risks being maybe a little bit

00:37:02
and engaging in some kind of exaggeration, right?

00:37:05
It's not every single sustainable urban transparency

00:37:08
that leads to the processes that she describes.

00:37:15
But there is a tendency for these policies to create some inequalities and for deep politicizing the debate

00:37:17
so

00:37:23
It's not exactly clear who these policies are supposed to be for they are these

00:37:27
Obvious a little bit again in this kind of neoclassical

00:37:31
Direction rational tools of now dealing with

00:37:33
With the car is the problem, right?

00:37:39
So in fact, the power relations in transport or in transport policy have not really changed.

00:37:45
It's just that the focus has shifted significantly and now this is what the planets are doing,

00:37:48
as opposed to what they were doing in the 1970s and '80s.

00:37:52
Let's dive into this.

00:38:00
Whoops. Great. So what are the, and that's my individual, how to put it.

00:38:06
my personal top five of the reasons why sustainable urban transport paradigm is not exactly the

00:38:12
you know doesn't give you a complete view of the relationship between transport and the city.

00:38:20
And also with some I think quite practical theoretical, empirical recipes for how to get out of this

00:38:29
roadblock pan unintended. So the first issue with a lot of the writing on sustainability is that it's

00:38:31
it's still very much focused on technology.

00:38:34
So there is a lot of attention given to technological solutions,

00:38:36
where social and political innovations

00:38:40
and some brought about political activity,

00:38:44
organization, engagement of people as political agents,

00:38:48
not just the consumers and customers that have to be now

00:38:50
convinced to shift from one mode to another,

00:38:52
from the car to something else.

00:38:54
This is not so present.

00:38:58
And well, this comes from the guru himself.

00:39:00
Elon Musk, who is, despite, of course,

00:39:03
some obvious critique, was his personality

00:39:06
and how he carries himself in media,

00:39:10
he still is very much the hope for many

00:39:14
in terms of transitioning from carbon heavy

00:39:16
modes of mobility to electric vehicles,

00:39:18
which according to the industry

00:39:19
are the thing of the future.

00:39:23
So according to Elon Musk, as he says,

00:39:26
I think public transport is painful, it sucks.

00:39:27
Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other

00:39:29
that doesn't leave where you want it to leave,

00:39:31
doesn't start where you want it to start,

00:39:34
doesn't end where you want it to end.

00:39:35
It's a pain in the ass.

00:39:38
And so that's why people like individualized transport

00:39:41
that goes where you want and when you want.

00:39:45
So the idea here is not to engage in

00:39:46
collectivizing transport, for example,

00:39:49
and making this a more common service

00:39:51
or a more common experience to break

00:39:54
not only the paradigm of dependency on fossil fuels

00:40:00
the car, but the tendency on the visual transport, making this basically a less individual

00:40:04
activity, which is a social political activity as well.

00:40:08
Now to the contrary, here the idea is to develop a better technology within the power

00:40:09
and a more than a visual transport.

00:40:15
And you don't mask, I mean, he's doing a lot of things, but one of the other things

00:40:21
in Tesla and the production of electric vehicles that he does is boring tunnels on the Los

00:40:27
Angeles to basically create some parallel motorway system if we can call it this way, that bypasses

00:40:35
congestion. So actually the focus here while might apparently be on making transport sustainable,

00:40:40
it is essentially to solve congestion, which is an extremely, as I explained last time, new

00:40:49
classical formulation of the problem. Another issue, and that's from an envious paper, but I think

00:40:54
It's not from the one that you had to read for today, but from another thing that I that I like from here is this

00:40:57
focus on

00:40:59
the individual as

00:41:02
not only well

00:41:09
I'm to put it not only is the source of a number of transport problems, but also as a solution to to address these problems, right?

00:41:10
So

00:41:12
the idea here is that

00:41:17
Essentially, we can convince people to change the habits,

00:41:20
to change the lifestyle related to transport and mobility.

00:41:23
And in this way, we can solve a number of issues related

00:41:28
to this field of urban planning or urban policies,

00:41:36
which means that within the sustainable paradigm,

00:41:39
a lot of policymakers, a lot of trans-foods, they hold us,

00:41:42
would rather than engage in the politics of transport,

00:41:45
they would engage on the pedagogy gets related to it.

00:41:50
So it's suddenly the challenge is to make sure

00:41:53
that people engage less in behavior

00:41:55
that is identified as bad behavior, for example,

00:41:59
driving or living in the suburbs, flying around,

00:42:03
and switching to what is considered to be good

00:42:04
type of behavior, positive behavior.

00:42:07
So, cycling around, walking,

00:42:09
living in a city center, living in these dense,

00:42:12
mixed urban areas that don't require

00:42:16
that you engage in mobility so much.

00:42:18
And while this, of course, is not a problem in itself,

00:42:23
I mean, it's good to think of why would people

00:42:25
stick to particular ways of moving?

00:42:28
What's very detrimental, I think, to the debate

00:42:31
and to ultimately solving some issues related to transport

00:42:36
is putting these different ways of moving

00:42:39
and different behaviors related to movement in a hierarchy

00:42:41
where clearly there is a moral component.

00:42:45
So this good and bad behavior, I think this is something

00:42:48
that can actually antagonize people against one another

00:42:51
rather than try to think of transfer problems

00:42:53
as common societal problems.

00:42:54
That's issue number one.

00:42:57
And issue number two is that in this discussion

00:43:02
about individual behavior, engagement with analyzing

00:43:04
and anonymity addressing structural causes

00:43:07
behind transport and mobility is not so present.

00:43:11
So if we focus on the question, why would people drive?

00:43:17
and why would people, for example, even in specific ethnicity or gender or class,

00:43:21
trying more than others, it is very important to also understand what is the structure

00:43:29
behind this, what is the general policy that allows people to obtain access to a vehicle

00:43:34
that allows a parallel or occurring structure which very often, and that's the case definitely in

00:43:41
Belgium, it's often absolutely free to use with no taxes to use motorways,

00:43:48
or with cheap parking, etcetera, etcetera. So this perspective is in itself not a problem

00:43:52
to look at you know why people engage in particular, the type of behavior and other,

00:43:55
but it's very important to also understand structures behind this.

00:44:04
What Alejandro and Nia also writes a lot about and many others as well, but as I said I'm really

00:44:13
quite convinced by writing is the uneven geography that is being produced by these different

00:44:22
sustainable solutions. Some of these asking a question in the chat, so let me read that.

00:44:27
So maybe there's something in between. For example, self-driving cars and apps like Uber

00:44:32
would be able to create smaller vehicles that can be shared as public transport. So in a sense,

00:44:40
in between but in between of in between what and between private I mean in

00:44:43
really individual transport and and collective transport you mean

00:44:50
Rudy do you want to explain whoever you are?

00:45:00
Hello Rudy are you with us? I hope you didn't just write the comment left

00:45:04
Maybe the connection is not very good on your end.

00:45:11
Well, yeah, I mean, clearly in recent years, there's

00:45:15
been a rise of expectations towards this, shared mobility

00:45:15
laws, right?

00:45:19
So a number of practices which allow you to get access to

00:45:21
seemingly collectivize transport like Uber.

00:45:25
I mean, essentially you don't own the vehicle, but it's just

00:45:28
not even a phone call with a tap on your phone away.

00:45:34
But there is a number of issues with this.

00:45:40
So there's a question whether this actually replaces individual transport.

00:45:44
So do people have less cars because Uber is expanding in this city

00:45:47
if we're focusing on Uber industries?

00:45:51
There is also a lot of studies that show that Uber actually adds to congestion.

00:45:56
So there are more Uber develops in the city or it's counterparts

00:46:00
are different, are the competitive platforms left in China.

00:46:03
There was a huge company called DDE that essentially does what

00:46:05
it was with us.

00:46:08
So there are more of these companies developed in your city.

00:46:14
There are more, what the total number of vehicles, the car stock,

00:46:18
increases, which means, and that's a problem in a lot of Chinese cities,

00:46:20
you basically have more traffic jams.

00:46:23
So these cars are in traffic all the time.

00:46:24
They keep looking for customers.

00:46:30
they have a mobile, which means that you add to the problem that you try to solve, which

00:46:34
when you try to solve again adding more to these shared platforms.

00:46:40
And also the big issue with Uber, if we are focusing on this for a moment, is that the

00:46:43
working conditions of course are quite terrible.

00:46:48
So the idea there is that essentially there are exceptions to this, but in most cities where

00:46:49
Uber operates.

00:46:55
We workers are not really workers, they're contractors, which means that they very often

00:46:59
go in debt to actually get the vehicle that they're driving, that they have to pay back

00:47:03
to Uber, because it's offering also these services.

00:47:05
This means that they work for a long hours.

00:47:11
Unlike regular taxi drivers that have to actually clock in and out, this is much more

00:47:15
regulated in terms of how they work for a lot amount of time and also what knowledge

00:47:20
of the city they have. I don't know how often you've taken Uber in your life, but it's

00:47:25
often the case that these drivers are exploring the city along. I mean, they just learn

00:47:31
as they drive, which I understand they might come from a very difficult situation that

00:47:37
this is the only way for them to get access to a more or less decent way of making money.

00:47:43
But there's a question of safety, there's a question of ethics in terms of inviting such

00:47:49
your practice in our cities. So there are a lot of expectations for these platforms and indeed

00:47:54
there is a question, does this maybe set between public transport, collective transport and

00:48:00
individual transport but I would say that these hopes are still not really fulfilled.

00:48:05
Okay, that was a bit of a delay question. Let's go back to an even geography of sustainable transport.

00:48:14
So what is the problem here? More often than not, the application of the sustainable tools,

00:48:19
different policies, infrastructural measures to deal with mobility,

00:48:27
especially quite exclusive. What does it mean? Well, on the one hand, it often happens that

00:48:31
a lot of these measures are applied in a specific area of the city and more often than not,

00:48:40
This is the central urban core, which has to be saved from the car, which the car has to limit its presence,

00:48:46
which in no way contradicts or prevents further maintenance at least, if not development or further

00:48:52
infrastructure for the cars in more peripheral areas. So you can think of cities in which in the city

00:48:58
centre you've got restrictive parking regulations, you've got a lot of pedestrian areas.

00:49:00
It's simply not easy to drive around.

00:49:05
I think transport is definitely a more logical thing to do and to use to get into.

00:49:07
But the farther you go to the suburbs, the more

00:49:14
month I lay in streets or highways you see, or actual proper highways, a lot of parking lots,

00:49:19
all the infrastructure that actually well belongs to the 1970s and 1980s.

00:49:25
And that is, I think, situation not only in Belgium or in Brussels specifically,

00:49:42
But in a lot of these cities that are supposedly have achieved a great level of policy in terms of dealing with with with cuts of Copenhagen, Vienna, a lot of French cities that boast these tram renewal programs.

00:49:48
As long as you are in the central part of the city, this old looks very coherent and very

00:49:53
well inverted, common, good from the sustainable transport perspective.

00:49:56
But the farther you go from the city centre, the more actually the more cars you see, the

00:50:02
more it actually resembles the problem that these policies try to solve.

00:50:09
Another inequality is of the vertical kind, meaning that it often happens that the investment

00:50:15
in these kind of sustainable tools comes at the cost of putting the current infrastructure underground.

00:50:22
So you can think of any case in which the specialization of an urban avenue or pull-over,

00:50:26
that means that the cars have to be put underground parking lots or the highways.

00:50:34
And this is often the problem in the so-called Car-Free Cities. The cities that are often picked up

00:50:39
by international media and praised for having addressed head-on the domination of the

00:50:49
cars and dealt with the problem of opportunity. A specific tool that I think we can see this

00:50:56
uneven geography in is a question in the chat. An example for Rudy's question from Berlin,

00:51:00
great. Let me go on with the congestion charging while you're discussing Uber in the chat.

00:51:07
this is perfectly allowed. So an example of this uneven geography can be found in

00:51:15
congestion charging, which is one of the let's say one of the most classical tools of sustainable

00:51:21
transport paradigm in terms of limiting the presence of the cars. The idea is simple. It came from

00:51:26
Singapore in the 1970s, which was developed as a very new classical tool of planning,

00:51:32
basically the problem was congestion and the idea was to convince to encourage drivers to use the

00:51:40
car off peak, so to minimize the traffic, the traffic jams in morning and afternoon or evening peak hours.

00:51:47
And progressively this tool, or perhaps with a shift of velocity behind transmit from the

00:51:55
neoclassical sustainable perspectives, this tool was picked up by the sustainable narrative. And now

00:51:59
It not only allows to solve congestion, but actually it allows to limit the presence of the

00:52:04
current city, which of course supposedly makes a positive impact on the urban environment.

00:52:08
And this tool has been put in place in the number of cities in Europe.

00:52:14
So you hear sea pictures from Oslo, but actually this exists in pretty much all

00:52:22
Norwegian cities and towns. So a system of tolling gates in London, which is probably the most

00:52:28
important or the most known case in Europe, in Milan, but you also have similar policies and

00:52:34
instruments in Stockholm and Sweden. And then recently also in Brussels announced with a lot of

00:52:41
pump and circumstance this idea that now it will cost the user the end-user money to enter with

00:52:50
a car to the Brussels capital region. So while this gets a lot of attention and this policy is

00:52:57
is discussed as a very efficient tool

00:53:01
in terms of limiting the presence of the current in cities.

00:53:02
There is questionable evidence.

00:53:06
I'm not saying that this policy is a bad policy,

00:53:07
but it never works.

00:53:13
But basically, it's supposed productive results

00:53:16
in terms of limiting the car are not exactly

00:53:19
there in the evidence.

00:53:20
So the results are quite mixed.

00:53:23
On the one hand, we see that in a number of cities,

00:53:25
traffic, of course, diminishes.

00:53:28
But since it's the delimited zone,

00:53:30
it's quite particular.

00:53:33
So it's not a whole agglomeration that actually

00:53:35
has the access to the car limited.

00:53:39
We see that the traffic often moves from, of course,

00:53:41
the zone in which the congestion challenge

00:53:43
is applied to the outer areas.

00:53:45
In London, for instance, it's quite clear

00:53:49
that there is significantly more traffic around that zone.

00:53:52
It's the same case in Madrid, which essentially

00:53:55
followed a very similar principle.

00:53:57
There is also very questionable evidence

00:53:59
about what happens with the funds that are being raised

00:54:01
through these systems.

00:54:02
So while very often, these policies

00:54:06
are put in place with this narrative of saving the city

00:54:09
from the car, of making some kind of societal transition

00:54:14
to post-car society, in cities like Oslo or London,

00:54:16
funds from these schemes.

00:54:18
And in all that's very clear, in London,

00:54:20
maybe a little bit less transparent.

00:54:23
But at least part of these funds goes to actually maintenance

00:54:24
and construction of current construction.

00:54:27
In all it's very common practice

00:54:29
to put these congestion charging areas

00:54:32
or booths, if you will,

00:54:36
to actually subsidize the construction of specific

00:54:39
transport infrastructure, road tunnel or bridge.

00:54:41
It's done in a very transparent way.

00:54:44
So in a sense, it's basically asking the transport

00:54:47
the car user to contribute a little bit more,

00:54:49
because of course, this contribution is already there

00:54:52
through tax system, to the construction,

00:54:54
to the financing of the construction

00:54:57
of transport infrastructure of current infrastructure.

00:55:01
And finally, the impact of these schemes

00:55:04
on overall quality of the city,

00:55:08
not just on a quality in a specific area,

00:55:09
is quite limited.

00:55:13
So, yeah, I said it basically.

00:55:16
So despite the narrative of these practices

00:55:18
saving urban environment,

00:55:21
it's not exactly clear that this is the most obvious thing

00:55:22
to do to limit the smog in a city,

00:55:26
especially when these areas are quite,

00:55:27
especially limited.

00:55:31
The problems that immediately emerge

00:55:34
from policies like congestion charging is that,

00:55:37
well, it leads to some social segregation.

00:55:44
And so we expect that all people react to this policy in a similar way.

00:55:47
They will reconsider whether they want to try or not, whether they want to enter,

00:55:49
into the zone by current or not.

00:55:53
But in fact, of course, those who do not pay from the vehicle,

00:55:57
and in particular in Belgium, this is a policy that is very widespread.

00:56:01
Half of new vehicles sold in Belgium are so-called company cars,

00:56:04
which are received for free by employees from the company

00:56:08
as a way of giving them tax-free salary bonus basically.

00:56:11
So for these people who do not pay for the vehicle itself

00:56:15
and often whose consumption of the vehicle will gas,

00:56:18
or any kind of fuel they put in the car insurance,

00:56:20
this is all paid by the company very often.

00:56:23
This very often basically is included in the package.

00:56:24
So the congestion charging is actually not covered

00:56:27
by the individual, it's covered by the structure

00:56:31
that provides the vehicle in the first place.

00:56:36
While of course those who do not have a job who might be seeking one,

00:56:44
those who are from lower working class background who might also be doing very difficult,

00:56:49
complicated irregular trips that require entering and leaving in different times of day,

00:56:54
because they need to get to a job that quite simply requires getting by current.

00:56:59
Going back here to this example of somebody working logistics,

00:57:02
public transport between Mollenberg or Savantam, for example,

00:57:04
at three o'clock in the morning being simply not there,

00:57:08
you have to have a card to reach this kind of activity

00:57:13
to be able to access the kind of urban function.

00:57:17
And then ultimately, what it does to mobility

00:57:18
is commodified.

00:57:22
So it's an essentially neoliberal service.

00:57:24
You pay as much as you use.

00:57:27
It's not a common system anymore.

00:57:30
The idea is that everybody pays not according to the means

00:57:35
but according to the ultimately the price decided by the market.

00:57:41
So again, not to say that this is a part of good idea

00:57:44
but to say that there is quite simply a lot of questions

00:57:47
a lot of them quite clearly related to critical geography

00:57:49
that should be asked about these policies.

00:57:51
It's already passed seven.

00:57:54
So it's just we take at least 500 break

00:57:55
before we can continue.

00:57:56
So get a little bit of a drink.

00:58:01
whatever it is that you are you sipping to make through this lecture.

00:58:05
And I'll see you back in in for five minutes, all right.

[ Silence ]

01:03:42
Okay, let's try to resume.

01:03:49
I'm going to share my screen once again.

01:03:59
All right.

01:04:01
Where are we?

01:04:04
All right

01:04:11
I suppose you hear me and you see me

01:04:15
Great perfect so

01:04:22
Continuing with the uneven geography of sustainable transport measures

01:04:27
Here you have a very simple

01:04:35
or even a map or a scheme that shows a little bit how this limitation plays out in space.

01:04:39
So also, I don't know if you've heard about that, but also is one of the most

01:04:44
-marketised cities in terms of its alleged fight against the car.

01:04:50
It's leading some kind of a war against the petrol fuel vehicles.

01:04:55
And basically there is this area in the city in which to which access is not only restricted

01:04:58
in terms of extra payment, right?

01:05:00
So there was a cube.

01:05:03
At several layers of this congestion charging,

01:05:07
and then the final one is this ultra inner city

01:05:12
in which cars propelled by gas or fuel.

01:05:14
I'm not allowed, there's only electric vehicles.

01:05:15
But then when you look at the whole

01:05:17
of the migration of the city is quite clear that,

01:05:20
I mean, this is a very small area.

01:05:23
So we are actually talking about quite specific zones

01:05:25
of the city, which as I mentioned,

01:05:32
supposedly saved from the car and as opposed to be made more pedestrian or people friendly.

01:05:44
Same idea or same limitation can be seen in Madrid which, until recently, had also quite a restrictive mobility area.

01:05:50
This has changed with a change of political majority, it does not matter, but this area still exists over the rules.

01:05:53
have changed to some extent.

01:05:58
The idea is that Madrid, which was called in worldwide media,

01:06:02
as an anti-car municipality, a municipality that takes

01:06:05
some radical measures to limit the presence of the car.

01:06:08
In fact, well, it does serve, but it does so

01:06:13
within quite limited designated area,

01:06:16
whereas you see that in a general map.

01:06:19
There is a whole current structure around it,

01:06:23
multiple motorways both around and from that central area.

01:06:26
So there's a question with the automability

01:06:31
is actually being properly challenged

01:06:34
or is this more of an urban policy that focuses

01:06:37
on valorization of specific areas of the city.

01:06:41
And here it's you don't have to be a smart critical geography

01:06:45
to ask if this is not part of some revitalization strategies

01:06:49
that try to increase rent and profits

01:06:53
to gentify quite simply a specific areas of the city,

01:06:57
the limitation of car traffic being part of that policy,

01:07:01
to beautify the area, to make it more attractive to tourists,

01:07:06
to specific type of investors, while limiting mobility

01:07:09
of this kind.

01:07:11
This we've covered.

01:07:17
And here we arrive to the well, to a case of such a policy,

01:07:21
limiting presence of the car, the Pietonier in Brussels,

01:07:23
which I'm quite sure.

01:07:28
All of you have already experienced and seen.

01:07:31
So, well, this map you've seen quite a lot before

01:07:36
and show Brussels with its zone 30,

01:07:39
so the limitation of speed there.

01:07:46
the Petonier marked in red at the moment of installation, the biggest pedestrian area in Europe.

01:07:54
I wonder whether you've got any impressions of this place before I show you my take on

01:08:00
or share with you my take on what happened over there. I imagine you have been to Lippetonia,

01:08:06
but do you have any any interesting thoughts about this? Do you like this place? Do you think

01:08:17
It's not so great. I don't know. I don't have a very deep thought about it. I don't think

01:08:25
but it's definitely nicer than it was. I mean, I lived in the center for like five years ago

01:08:31
or like five years ago, like long ago, but like it was really horrible. Like when you cycle

01:08:38
through like downtown it was really awful because like the road was just disgusting like

01:08:45
you don't you didn't really want to be there. I mean it's a bit I don't know I don't have

01:08:54
the feeling it's very much it's it's very true for what it is you know like for like I don't

01:08:59
know it doesn't really feel like a downtown it feels a little bit provincial but like at least

01:09:04
I'm definitely happy with that it's much better than it used to be.

01:09:11
It's definitely an improvement, but it feels the big city vibe a bit.

01:09:12
Okay.

01:09:17
But those of you who didn't see it before it was changing to a village scenario,

01:09:24
I think it's the slice you see in the top image how this street could look like on a Friday afternoon,

01:09:25
quite regularly.

01:09:28
So full of cars for full lanes.

01:09:33
And then, well, the situation, that's of course pre-covid.

01:09:34
Well, I don't know.

01:09:37
I probably right now, if you took that picture,

01:09:38
would be quite similar.

01:09:42
Anybody else who has some impressions

01:09:44
of how this transformation looked like?

01:09:49
Somebody who loves this, somebody who hates this,

01:09:51
and for whatever reason?

01:09:55
I agree with you, everyone,

01:09:58
because it was a place.

01:10:01
And when I passed, when I studied in Brussels,

01:10:03
I would have passed with my girlfriends.

01:10:06
I don't want my girlfriend to let alone,

01:10:09
or they had to place some years ago.

01:10:13
But one frustration, I guess from,

01:10:16
I followed the top process.

01:10:21
And what I know was it was very difficult for transportation,

01:10:26
like like M.E.B. and the steep public transport,

01:10:30
to pass because the lane was cut.

01:10:31
Yeah.

01:10:36
So they waited for four, four, two hours to go to another place

01:10:38
when it set to us, five minutes was two hours.

01:10:43
So you need to affect it the other modes of,

01:10:44
of trying to not only the car,

01:10:46
but also public transport.

01:10:47
Yeah.

01:10:47
Yeah.

01:10:50
The victim was public transport and I guess in,

01:10:53
in Brussels, it's very important to,

01:10:55
when you have a prestige project like that,

01:11:00
You need to consider all of transport modes and not only pedestrians.

01:11:03
Praise each project.

01:11:05
I think also it's an important thing.

01:11:10
Also like an element to add maybe is that it's terrible

01:11:11
if you go by bike.

01:11:13
It's really not made for bicycles.

01:11:16
Like I tried cycling through it and I mean, right now

01:11:17
it's not so busy and it's all right.

01:11:22
But like on days when there's lots of tourists,

01:11:25
of course lots of people use the area.

01:11:28
So then it's really not nice to cycle there.

01:11:30
Yes, I share these impressions.

01:11:32
I mean, these are not only impressions

01:11:36
and the fact is that this area was redeveloped

01:11:38
but without any bicycle policy in mind.

01:11:41
So there is basically, I'm not,

01:11:43
I'm the last person to say that what was there before

01:11:45
was great, but you can vaguely see it

01:11:47
on the right hand side of the top picture

01:11:48
that there is actually a bicycle lane.

01:11:51
Not a great one, but there was one.

01:11:54
Now it's simply not there.

01:11:57
somebody's writing something in the chat.

01:11:58
Why did they take down the larger trees

01:12:00
to be a traditionalization of Boulevardless?

01:12:03
But I find the landscaping quite poor.

01:12:06
Well, so there was a number of things at stake.

01:12:09
I mean, let's cover that first.

01:12:12
It was announced in January 2014,

01:12:14
the municipal authorities of the city of Brussels.

01:12:17
So we said, "Meel, Brussels 1000,

01:12:19
"and ours that they want to expand

01:12:20
"and existing pedestrians."

01:12:22
So you already had some streets,

01:12:23
especially towards the Commonwealth of London,

01:12:26
were not open for the class.

01:12:28
And the context of that-- and that's quite an important thing--

01:12:31
is that there was a series of protests

01:12:33
called Under the Slogon of Picnic the Streets,

01:12:37
a movement of some spontaneous civil disobedience.

01:12:40
Basically, people would occupy space that would normally

01:12:41
be taken by cars.

01:12:45
You see that in the top picture, normally a lot of cars.

01:12:47
So right in front of books, there

01:12:50
would be basically some kind of an action.

01:12:56
people would just sit down and enjoy their son and manifest that they want allegedly

01:13:01
this space to be for people, taken away from the cars. This space should be freed from

01:13:05
the cars to make the city centre of Brussels for sustainable, more attractive and more

01:13:10
livable. The project is launched in June 2015, so that's one of the

01:13:15
three is closed. And there is an eight-man test phase without any infrastructural change.

01:13:19
So at first, to go a little bit to the question of design, there is no design change. Basically,

01:13:25
the street is closed and there is as many people call it a sea of asphalt.

01:13:29
I mean suddenly you can walk on this on the street, which place a little bit,

01:13:33
of course, on people's imaginary that suddenly you realize how, how huge this

01:13:38
infrastructure given to the car is and what could happen in place of this infrastructure.

01:13:44
Well, and then progressively after this eight-month phase, we see some kind of

01:13:50
infrastructure development, so an actual change of the built environment.

01:13:54
The problem there is, is that, well, there was a quality of design that has been put in

01:13:55
the question.

01:13:59
I'm not a designer or landscape, but a lot of people have criticized the way that this

01:14:00
looks like.

01:14:06
The immediate limitation is that, right underground, we've got a canal towards the end

01:14:09
of the bits of the year, and we also have a metro line, of pre-metroline, which runs

01:14:12
right under the surface of the street.

01:14:15
So it's not, for example, possible apparently

01:14:19
to put large trees over there, which already

01:14:23
starts making an impact in terms of how the space is done.

01:14:28
Well, there were very high aspirations

01:14:31
when Pitunio was announced.

01:14:33
It was not only supposed to be a transport project,

01:14:36
or according to some scholars in Brussels,

01:14:39
or even politicians, it was not a transport project,

01:14:40
or a mobility project.

01:14:47
was an urban renewal project which by closing this Paris like Boulevard because actually

01:14:56
it is in its architecture very much an inspiration of Parisian boulevards. A closing of it to

01:15:01
motorized traffic was supposedly a step towards getting the city center or the city as such

01:15:09
out of the climb to put as the mayor of a moistel mill of the particular moistel

01:15:14
said that Brussels, the Belgian and European capital would finally enjoy a truly dynamic,

01:15:20
pedestrian, attractive and friendly inner city, like many other international metropolists.

01:15:25
The Plas de Guacare, which is located in the northern part of the Piedtagnier,

01:15:30
and that's the famous square famous I'm not sure, but the characteristic one with the Coca-Cola

01:15:38
and signed that lights up. It was compared to Times Square, so the idea was to make this project

01:15:43
It allowed Brussels to become an international city

01:15:45
to create this prestige project,

01:15:47
as it was, I think, very rightly said,

01:15:49
that would put Brussels on the international map.

01:15:53
It was not just a question of getting rid of some

01:15:55
correlated new senses.

01:15:58
And of course, the moment that plan was unearthed,

01:15:59
there were a number of critics.

01:16:01
So there were shopkeepers that were upset,

01:16:02
claiming that they would use customers

01:16:05
because people could not drive into the shop,

01:16:08
residents, a number of citizen organizations.

01:16:11
What were the issues that they would mention,

01:16:14
and even the problems that they would note about the project?

01:16:16
Well, they very much relate to this

01:16:19
and the geography that I was talking about.

01:16:22
So if you look at the map of the Pizzo here,

01:16:27
in red UCDs, at that time Europe's largest

01:16:29
pedestrian zone, I think now it's been surpassed by Ghent

01:16:31
and other cities.

01:16:34
Brussels is certainly not the only city in Europe

01:16:37
or in the world that engages in these policies.

01:16:48
It is, of course, the main central axis is cut, but you see that you can actually drive around the city center.

01:16:56
So you've got this area which is pedestrian friendly if we can put it this way, where cars mobility is extremely limited.

01:17:01
But in fact, you can quite easily drive into the Pentagon, as we call it, and drive around.

01:17:06
On top of that was also very clear is that a particularity of Brussels,

01:17:10
which is a very high presence of underground or multi-story parking lots,

01:17:12
is largely unquestioned.

01:17:19
So actually this day, today, there is about 19 parking spots within the

01:17:22
pendant, within the Struk City Centre of Brussels.

01:17:26
The original plan of pedestrianising will advance.

01:17:32
a lot included the creation of additional 1 parking spots.

01:17:38
So the idea would be that, of course, we give this space to the pedestrian and we allow this

01:17:42
space to be somehow reclaimed from the car.

01:17:46
But in fact, the cost of this, or the price of this, I don't know how to call it, is that

01:17:48
we actually add to the current infrastructure.

01:17:55
So we definitely do not want to make this be less accessible as it was called by the cars.

01:18:00
And then as one of you mentioned, there was an immediate conflict with a public transport

01:18:05
operator, the most important one in Brussels, Stephen McAvill, who basically saw their

01:18:07
lines pushed out of the zone.

01:18:14
So suddenly the buses that would cross that area have to have to have these stops relocated,

01:18:23
which means the accessibility for people who rely on public transport is somewhat reduced

01:18:24
right.

01:18:31
Well, that's some years later. I think that picture is from 2018, as I remember checking on Google.

01:18:35
Well, those are kind of a pushback, right? So the cars that were at first,

01:18:40
definitely not allowed in Petonier now in some circumstances, in some situations, can actually

01:18:45
enter. So you can actually see, and that's taken directly from Google, I didn't have to go to the

01:18:51
Petonier and wait for a track to enter. You actually see, of course, the delivery vehicles,

01:18:56
but also public transport you see over there in the back of the picture as she does a bus

01:19:01
making a turn and entering a petrion. And whenever I'm there with friends who are not from

01:19:06
Brussels, I mean they are really surprised to be on the pedestrian area with public transport

01:19:11
buses and trucks and taxi drivers and other vehicles who in exceptional circumstances actually can

01:19:17
enter. Which question is a little bit this, I mean is this a pedestrian area or is this a pedestrian

01:19:21
area but without really getting rid of all the costs.

01:19:30
The question of making this a prestige project and putting Brussels on the map,

01:19:35
I mean there is an argument there to be made and some local critical

01:19:39
geographers have made it myself included that this in fact indeed is not a

01:19:42
transport project in the mobility project. It's clearly a project of

01:19:49
of re-valorizing this particular part of the city, it's quite clear that as you go down

01:19:54
southwards down Boulevard of Stau and Boulevard of Le Monier towards the South Station

01:20:00
Government of Medi, those of you who have been there, I'm sure, I'm sure noticed it,

01:20:05
those of you who haven't, that's where we will go on the excursion that I hope we will

01:20:06
do.

01:20:10
In spring, you see that this is one of the poorest neighborhoods in Brussels, one with

01:20:17
very high youth unemployment, especially when there was a very precarious, tightly knit,

01:20:20
but very vulnerable local economy.

01:20:27
And any kind of change in built environments puts this economy under huge pressure, especially

01:20:35
when the narrative around Kaitanya clearly includes this idea of bringing big grants, tourism,

01:20:42
to the pedestrian area making this a place of facilities, of consumption, of continuous festival.

01:20:49
So for example, the ultimate for comments of the city of Brussels famously said that

01:20:54
the objective here is not to change mobility. The objective is to create a commercial

01:20:59
promenade, new brands which are not yet present in Brussels are coming. There is a real craze

01:21:07
and you can feel it. For the current Brussels 1000 May not the one that had to step down because

01:21:14
of some corruption scandal, the aim of the project is to keep or bring the middle-class

01:21:20
to Brussels to increase its tax base. So suddenly the idea is not just to or not at all to actually

01:21:26
get rid of the cars or allow pedestrians to enjoy in some kind of newly created area,

01:21:29
It's a very urban project in a very twisted way.

01:21:35
So the idea really is to create a new space and your neighborhood perhaps of consumption,

01:21:44
of leisure, of 24/7 shopping, which also, of course, uses or engages with the narrative

01:21:51
of sustainability and livability, and is somewhat related to mobility and transport, but to a limited

01:21:52
extent. Okay.

01:21:56
Can I still add something to that?

01:22:03
If you go back to that slide, you see that there is almost only white people there.

01:22:10
So the people that you talked about that you see on the lower slide, like the owners

01:22:17
of the PC market, owners of the 5.50, basically all people with a color, they don't

01:22:21
feature in the marketing of the city about the project.

01:22:26
It's a very good point, of course. That's a very common issue with these visualizations

01:22:28
and imagining of future.

01:22:33
Everyone's super white. But there's one black man on the right.

01:22:40
But there's also no people with disabilities, very few old people.

01:22:48
Yes, it's not a very diverse image. It's a good point. And also in no way does it correspond

01:22:51
the actual reality of that neighborhood and the kind of services.

01:22:53
Absolutely not.

01:22:56
Well, I mean, yeah.

01:22:58
Well, I'm really just teed it up.

01:23:02
So we cover some important stuff until we finish.

01:23:03
No, no, but thank you.

01:23:04
It's a good comment.

01:23:07
There is, of course, all issues related to participation

01:23:13
and no actual change of power in the P

01:23:16
is a very good example of how these sustainable ideas

01:23:22
can be applied without changing at all questions of who actually decides and for whom transport

01:23:28
policies are being made. So very often the sustainable discourse focuses when a

01:23:35
demandance participation of users of the of the of the of the projects. It basically

01:23:41
imagines that the main idea is that it will consensus to inform people of the decisions that

01:23:46
are rational, that are good practices, best practices in terms of achieving sustainable

01:23:49
mobility, protecting the environment and whatnot.

01:23:54
So as a Flamish actually scholar once wrote it in 2000

01:23:57
about the problems of sustainable transport policies.

01:23:59
That's the last bullet point.

01:24:02
These policies include a harmonious and conflict

01:24:04
of only vocabulary that ignores and silences

01:24:07
the deeply contested ways through which the transport system

01:24:09
is continuously shaped and transformed,

01:24:11
and which inevitably results in a variety of winning

01:24:14
and losing interest groups.

01:24:16
in the case of the Kit-Wun-Ye, but that's, I think,

01:24:19
the case in many other sustainable transport projects.

01:24:22
This idea of winners and losers is swept under the carpet.

01:24:25
So in theory, everybody gains,

01:24:28
but those who are clearly upset are not heard,

01:24:30
are not really listened to and often are mocked.

01:24:33
So again, we go back to this moral geography

01:24:35
of bad behavior and good behavior,

01:24:37
of silly shopkeepers who don't understand

01:24:39
that this is a project that they will benefit from,

01:24:42
bad car drivers, they want to access the city,

01:24:45
versus good consuming middle class pedestrians

01:24:49
or cyclists, not so much on the case of duplicating method.

01:24:52
Cyclists are also part of the vision.

01:24:58
And in all this, to make this point quite short,

01:25:00
there is much more impact,

01:25:03
no, not impact, much more focus,

01:25:07
much more emphasis on the success of these practices,

01:25:12
rather than on the interaction with complex social,

01:25:15
spatial phenomena that are there in the city.

01:25:18
So there was much more focus on the transport part

01:25:20
of transport project rather than on the urban part

01:25:21
of the purchase.

01:25:23
Well, we don't have a lot of time to deal with,

01:25:26
okay, what could be done with this hegemony

01:25:30
of neo-Neoclassical on the one hand, that's last week,

01:25:32
and sustainable on the other.

01:25:35
That's today, perspective on transport, but let's try.

01:25:39
So what would diverse critical approaches

01:25:42
to transport and mobility be?

01:25:45
On the one hand, the new mobility paradigm.

01:25:46
So that's another reading for today,

01:25:49
if you manage to read it, that's great.

01:25:52
If not, I encourage you to have a look

01:25:55
because that's an absolutely fundamental reading

01:25:57
for mobility scholars these days.

01:25:59
I mean, many shallering John Aria

01:26:03
to very important figures in this field of geography

01:26:07
or any kind of discipline that deals with mobility and transport.

01:26:10
So here, we've got a bit of a shift of attention,

01:26:14
shift of focus, and it's really putting,

01:26:18
it's shifting away from transport as an infrastructural phenomenon,

01:26:21
for example, to a mobility as a social and political phenomenon

01:26:25
that's an respective built on diverse disciplines

01:26:28
from sociology and political studies to a geography

01:26:30
and anthropology.

01:26:31
And it really explores a lot of issues

01:26:36
cultural studies scholars for example, would deal with looking at a number of phenomena happening in

01:26:41
cities. So different representations and meanings of mobility, sensations, experiencing

01:26:46
experiences of mobility. Everything that happens on this might for level of what people,

01:26:53
what kind of practices and norms are being observable, being practiced in mobility related spaces

01:26:58
in public transport for example, in these pedestrian areas. What cultural codes and norms are related

01:27:07
to optimability. The problem with this particular approach is that well it looks very much at the

01:27:13
micro level and whenever it engages with structural issues around mobility it runs the risk of

01:27:18
being quite descriptive. So it mentions a number of issues, race, class, inequality but there is not

01:27:23
so much over methodological depth in terms of exploring these issues. And also it's a constant that

01:27:25
that is quite Western in a sense that they developed

01:27:29
in the global north and in rather specific areas of it.

01:27:33
And it only now starts engaging with situations

01:27:36
with empirical context, indigo global stuff.

01:27:43
Another approach, another avenue for doing critical research

01:27:48
by the trust of mobility is building on the traditions

01:27:50
of urban political economy of transport, right?

01:27:54
So looking at the city as a social and political construct,

01:27:57
which by no means, by in no way,

01:28:01
is governed by some rational laws of supply and demand,

01:28:03
like in the new classical paradigm,

01:28:07
or which does not really look at people as consumers

01:28:11
that have to be convinced to drop or to disengage

01:28:15
from unwelcome or bad type of behavior

01:28:17
and standing engaging in good type of behavior.

01:28:25
But rather looking at people at urban inhabitants as political agents who do not make just rational decisions in terms of how they move,

01:28:34
but have a political potential to shape the urban reality, to change how transport and mobility is organized in the locality in this city.

01:28:43
And when you look at critical urban geography and a lot of names that I'm sure you've already heard or maybe even read from before,

01:28:47
David Harvey, Neil Smith, Edward Sarger,

01:28:51
Dave all contributed to conceptualizing

01:28:53
to exploring this lane between

01:28:54
and for structural development

01:28:57
and social spatial distribution of public services.

01:29:02
So transport has been there to analyze

01:29:05
the critical development of the city.

01:29:09
But absolutely foundational readings there

01:29:13
or the first step towards critically exploring

01:29:15
the relationship between the transport and density,

01:29:18
come from feminist geographers who would arrive

01:29:20
and that's the reading that you also,

01:29:23
I think was assigned for today.

01:29:27
Susan Hansen's work on deconstructing this

01:29:29
behind the divide between the home and work

01:29:34
and attaching women with domestic situations

01:29:41
and apparently imagining them as less mobile beings

01:29:50
while attaching this mobility potential to predominantly male subjects and male situations.

01:29:59
And also, well, a very important part of that is to understand the homework

01:30:04
relationship in the homework commute, which I mentioned last week is absolutely the most

01:30:10
well, it's a foundational focus of transport geographers, analyzing these mobility

01:30:17
patterns related to the move from work to home. The feminist geographers already in 1980s

01:30:24
demonstrated that this way of looking at transport and also this way of engaging mobility is

01:30:29
fundamental for maintaining capital. This is something that is the cornerstone of the

01:30:37
of the capitalist system in cities or outside of them. What emerges from this is understanding

01:30:42
Transport and mobility is not just an infrastructural phenomenon or something that has some

01:30:46
environmental repercussions and some social ones and here I'm thinking about sustainable approach

01:30:56
to mobility, but as essentially a form of capital, mobility is a potential that is unevenly

01:31:03
distributed as any form of capital around a cross-society across its different spaces and across

01:31:09
it's classes, which leads to understanding and challenging different structures, social, political,

01:31:15
economic, that stand behind what makes transport unsustainable in the first place. So it's really

01:31:21
asking you a question why are people moving in particular ways not because they are used to a

01:31:25
particular lifestyle because they have some cultural norms but understanding a political and

01:31:30
economic system that enables, for instance, the domination of the car and trying to address the

01:31:35
the system as a result rather than looking at how people can be convinced and

01:31:39
all how situation in terms of mobility can be changed in specific areas of the city.

01:31:43
It's looking at things much more, much more broadly, much more structural always.

01:31:52
Right. So, and here I attached the geography to the end of this, to this slide.

01:31:54
So you can look at these different studies if you, if you're interested in

01:31:56
transport and mobility.

01:32:00
There is a line of research that is looked at the transport

01:32:05
and mobility as a way of reproducing existing social,

01:32:09
political, economic interests, regulatory frameworks,

01:32:12
power relations regulated by the market on the one hand

01:32:15
and by the state, and very often contested by from the bottom

01:32:17
up.

01:32:21
There is a lot of research, for some reason,

01:32:22
the references are not showing up.

01:32:24
But if you're interested, I'm more than happy to send you

01:32:27
that something is stranded with my slightly.

01:32:31
But there isn't ongoing work already going back to the 1990s

01:32:37
that shows how neoliberal policies that affect urban culture,

01:32:39
provision of housing, urban environment,

01:32:41
are also extremely present in provision of transport

01:32:45
and mobility, how in a natural transport

01:32:46
is increasingly commodified.

01:32:48
And for example, congestion charging,

01:32:50
and as I mentioned today, it's part of that.

01:32:54
It's turning, and we could think public space

01:32:56
that an urban motorway or an urban street

01:32:59
is, it to a commodity that has an additional price

01:33:02
that I can touch to it, which as we consume,

01:33:05
we have to additionally pay for, depending,

01:33:08
as I mentioned, not on our means, but basically

01:33:09
on our demand.

01:33:15
There is also a fundamental issue that many geographers dealt

01:33:19
with, that is of transport related inequality

01:33:21
and exclusion, so basically trying to understand,

01:33:27
to what extent transport enables movement of some people

01:33:30
while restricting that of others.

01:33:33
This will skip.

01:33:36
And of course, well, it might seem very obvious today,

01:33:39
but if you look at what was being done in geography,

01:33:42
now in geography or transport geography in the '80s,

01:33:44
the '90s was definitely not the case.

01:33:47
There is now a rise of research, which

01:33:50
looks at the questions of class and the questions of race

01:33:53
and the question of gender is absolutely fundamental

01:33:58
for understanding transport systems in cities and beyond them.

01:34:01
And one of them is this, well,

01:34:03
maybe not such a foundational reading,

01:34:06
but still something that is very important

01:34:09
and really define the agenda of research

01:34:13
into transport for at least this decade.

01:34:15
Of course, there's more recent stuff

01:34:16
that also has been written,

01:34:18
but I think this is quite a nice introduction

01:34:23
with the question of gender and mobility.

01:34:27
And here, we see that as with the questions of race

01:34:28
and the question with class, but this

01:34:30
is something that was already quite established

01:34:35
and if you'll already, there is an inseparable relationship

01:34:37
between gender and mobility.

01:34:40
That, on the one hand, transfer of mobility

01:34:43
mean development or some kind of opening

01:34:45
of accessibility to different opportunities,

01:34:50
breaking this supposed paradigm of the domestic female

01:34:53
and the work-related male, but actually mobility

01:34:56
is something that opens this paradigm,

01:34:59
that gender on the other hand affects travel reasons

01:35:01
and patterns in terms of the complexity,

01:35:04
in terms of the frequency and regularity,

01:35:08
and in terms of why actually people engage in movement,

01:35:10
why is they actually move around the city?

01:35:13
And perhaps one critique that could be made

01:35:19
the paper that I ask you to read for today is that the approaches women as a rather unified category

01:35:28
that can be maybe not reduced but summarized in terms of particular mobility patterns that

01:35:35
half of humanity engages. I think that's a little bit risky always. But what clearly I think is

01:35:42
interesting in this kind of line of work, as I said, there is a definite follow-up and work that

01:35:45
explore these questions in much more detail and it's much more fine to you to

01:35:51
sophisticated. But we see that without considering the agenda component we

01:35:56
basically missed the fact that in many urban contexts women engaged in a

01:36:00
completely different way with mobility. They conduct trips which are

01:36:05
much more complex, regular because they quite simply are related to

01:36:09
diverse, care-related activities. They would be much more inclined or

01:36:18
or perhaps forced to bring other people along to act as drivers for other passengers,

01:36:26
and because they engage in quite simply more activities than male subjects.

01:36:29
In this way, I'm simplifying here, of course, a whole lot,

01:36:31
but this way of approaching transport and mobility,

01:36:35
uncovers not only differences in terms of how people move,

01:36:39
but differences in terms of power relations that are there behind movement

01:36:45
and transport, which in my humble opinion is maybe a little bit there in sustainable

01:36:50
approaches to mobility, but it's quite simply not pronounced enough or it does not really show us

01:36:57
in full depth the the multi-level structure of power relations that are there behind

01:37:07
behind transport and mobility. Now what's left, we are running out of time so I don't

01:37:13
don't want to talk about everything, but what's also important to remember is that, well,

01:37:19
besides questions of transport workers, because so far we've basically talked mostly, if not

01:37:25
only about passenger transport users, people who use transport. There's a question of transport

01:37:31
labour, but also very importantly, a lot of research done on transport and mobility is a vehicle

01:37:35
for some contestation, discontent and struggle.

01:37:40
And I started these two sessions with Greta Tundberg,

01:37:43
with protests in Chile and other places.

01:37:47
And year in, year out, sometimes month in month out,

01:37:51
you see that transport is used as a very important subject

01:37:55
for a lot of very diverse movements and social groups

01:38:00
to express the discontent with whatever it is.

01:38:02
sometimes quite directly capitalist system,

01:38:04
and that's the case with Gilles-Jon,

01:38:08
who quite symbolically would occupy

01:38:12
roundabouts across rural or suburban France,

01:38:15
and sometimes symbolically,

01:38:16
and that's an East Jerusalem,

01:38:21
Palestinian activists attacking the light rail,

01:38:22
and kind of traumway stations,

01:38:26
as a symbol of Israeli colonization in East Jerusalem.

01:38:29
Sometimes this would be protest against

01:38:35
some kind of the surface level policy, like the increase of public transport fares or policing

01:38:40
and that's the case in New York City, or the construction of one of these underground parkings

01:38:45
related to the Piotonier that would add to the number of parking spots in the city while

01:38:53
supposedly actually opening the city for the for the people. This we will have to skip.

01:38:59
The very last point that I want to make today, I mean I still would like to give us maybe

01:39:03
10 minutes for your questions and maybe some comments.

01:39:06
If you still have energy to do that,

01:39:08
is that, and that's perhaps related a little bit

01:39:11
to this question of neoliberalization of transpose

01:39:14
and mobility, is that what we see is that

01:39:18
despite these different theoretical approaches

01:39:21
and critical questions that people,

01:39:23
critical geographers are asking,

01:39:27
we see a process of standardization

01:39:29
of transport policies.

01:39:32
So if you are a transport engineer and transport economist today,

01:39:37
there is really distancing towards unifying experiences

01:39:40
of different cities into a portfolio of best practices,

01:39:43
which are then transferable from one or currently

01:39:44
to another.

01:39:45
There's a huge business behind it,

01:39:51
and not only in terms of think towns and big consultancy firms,

01:39:52
but a whole flurry of events,

01:39:56
which you can learn from experiences of others,

01:39:59
which you can learn about what your city should be doing.

01:40:03
And some scholars have engaged with that,

01:40:05
studying specifically the policy mobility

01:40:08
of these best practices and recipes

01:40:10
in the field of urban transport.

01:40:14
But what's perhaps quite important to be to be added to this

01:40:19
is that, well, the story of policy transfer is quite long.

01:40:22
I mean, the tradition of deploying Western worldviews,

01:40:25
Eurocentric concepts and theories and methods

01:40:27
in a more or less unchanged way

01:40:32
in some other geographical contexts in Africa, Asia, Latin America,

01:40:38
is a very long story and the story as a name and its colonisation of coloniality.

01:40:47
And this is something that really is there to be done by the future generation of critical geographers,

01:40:52
or the transport geographers, or urban geographers. Is that of decolonising this body of knowledge

01:40:59
which pretty much everything that I have referred to in these two sessions comes very much

01:41:05
from the global north that reflects my own education, that's something that I think I still have

01:41:11
to do myself, is to really start looking at transport reality and start defining,

01:41:17
formulating questions about this reality in terms of transit mobility, not from our global

01:41:20
will know them perspective, but also that of the South.

01:41:24
And just again, it's just a simple example

01:41:27
of what this could mean in practice,

01:41:32
is looking at the question of informality in transport,

01:41:34
which traditionally, that's a slide from one

01:41:38
of these classic reports commissioned,

01:41:40
I think either by UN or the World Bank

01:41:44
on informal transport, looks at informality in transport

01:41:47
as something that means bad quality,

01:41:51
in terms of safety of passengers, speeding, environmental impact,

01:41:54
basically some alt-ricutty vehicles,

01:41:59
which are a way to be transformed into modern, Western,

01:42:03
formal public transport system.

01:42:06
The kind of we know from northern cities, like Brussels

01:42:11
or many others in Belgium, France or Germany, whatnot.

01:42:14
But, and that's something that has been done quite recently

01:42:22
is in process, is actually understanding our experience of transport and mobility in our formal

01:42:27
environments is very much something that can be informed by these informal experiences of the

01:42:34
Google South. An example, well, if you ever are at Garlic Media these days unfortunately this practice

01:42:41
is on hold because of you know what, there is a flurry maybe not but at least a few informal

01:42:48
transport practices that you can find in the Galdimi area, these informal taxis, vans that bring

01:42:55
passengers informally somewhat illegally from the south station to Sharlowar Airport to the

01:43:02
Brussels south Sharlowar Airport and to Paris, which exhibit very strong similarity with

01:43:08
many other informal practices that you can find in cities across South Asia, Africa and Latin America.

01:43:14
And then finally, while these practices of course attract whenever they do, they attract very negative

01:43:19
attention of the media, of the police, they have treated as something that is illegal and be unfair

01:43:27
to formal regulators that pay taxes and have to operate within the legal framework of, in this case,

01:43:34
the Brussels capital region, there is, and here we go back to the beginning of the first session,

01:43:38
A number of practices which are proposed by the transport industry,

01:43:42
transfer the mobility industry, Uber and many other app-based practices,

01:43:49
which are essentially informal practices, which try to operate in the insertices of the system,

01:43:55
somewhat legal, but also not to the full extent. If you think, for example, about what Uber does

01:44:01
to its workers or what is the spatial impact, if we can put this way or these

01:44:08
East Kudos, which operate in public space, but very often literally occupy the space, the paving

01:44:15
and whatnot, without necessarily making this system officially legal or recognised.

01:44:24
Well, here we pause our little write of two sessions. I apologise for this bit of a fast

01:44:29
pace ending to the second session, but I realise that we run out of time for discussing

01:44:34
things a little bit more detailed way, but we still have eight minutes for some

01:44:38
questions if you have them, maybe some points that you you have in your in your

01:44:44
head right now something that you want to share. This is the moment.

01:44:48
And maybe I'll stop sharing my slides.

01:44:59
Do you have some questions, some comments?

01:45:18
Well, it's perfectly fine if you don't, of course.

01:45:21
I mean, it's quite late in the day I understand it.

01:45:29
And it's definitely a suboptimal experience to do that through Zoom or any of these platforms.

01:45:35
Oh, right.

01:45:40
Vitaly is asking about transport labour.

01:45:42
There's also one more technical question.

01:45:50
Well, quite simply the concept of transport labour looks at labour relations and conditions in transport.

01:45:54
is trying to change the emphasis a little bit.

01:45:56
I mean, if you look at the literature

01:45:59
on the neoclassical or sustainable side,

01:46:04
and the dominant focus of, I would really say,

01:46:07
99% of the studies is on the passenger

01:46:11
or the driver or the consumer.

01:46:15
The question of what working conditions

01:46:18
are shift to sustainable transport intervals, for example,

01:46:20
It's very rarely asked.

01:46:26
And that I think can lead us into some dead end situations,

01:46:30
in which, for example, we really give a lot of hope

01:46:32
and we build a lot of expectations

01:46:34
towards some ability practices like Uber,

01:46:37
like the electric scooters or whatnot,

01:46:39
without really understanding that,

01:46:42
and that comes from transport-level literature,

01:46:45
that the main innovation that Uber brings to the table

01:46:49
perhaps is not connecting drivers and users,

01:46:50
because it existed before.

01:46:54
And I mean, informal transport without the app, of course.

01:46:58
But it exists in most cities in the world,

01:47:00
in a global, some global nodes

01:47:02
and cities being an exception rather than rule.

01:47:06
But the actual innovation is degrading

01:47:08
transport, degrading working relations

01:47:11
to end of the 19th century.

01:47:13
Basically, a worker has very few rights.

01:47:17
doesn't have to write the unionized collectively bargain.

01:47:19
And it's not even recognized as a worker.

01:47:23
It's basically some kind of free atom contractor

01:47:28
who in spare leisure time engages in driving people

01:47:32
around the city, which we all know from now

01:47:35
the whole body of work on Uber is definitely not the case.

01:47:38
And these people are full-time workers,

01:47:41
not just hubists who try to make some spare money

01:47:42
on the side.

01:47:45
So yes.

01:47:48
That's what's transport labor is about.

01:47:50
Some technical questions.

01:47:51
Let's address those.

01:47:52
For the next discussion,

01:47:56
Seminar is at the same way of working with PowerPoint and voice over.

01:48:01
Well, the way I understand you did it in other discussion

01:48:04
Seminuses that you basically recorded your presentation,

01:48:06
which then either you sent to me,

01:48:09
I think that's probably a better solution.

01:48:14
solution and we basically listen to and then we have a discussion in which you facilitate

01:48:20
it, right, as those who discuss the paper. So it's not exactly a voiceover. I mean,

01:48:25
so you don't present the PowerPoint's life, the ideas that you pre-record the presentation

01:48:33
with your fellow students. And will the exam be online as well? Yes, the exam will be

01:48:38
online and we are meeting with Basnik and David to discuss exactly how this will be

01:48:44
down most likely will be in well obviously since we will not be in your rooms it

01:48:49
will be an open book exam so you will have access to the slides and all that so

01:48:53
but since we haven't done that before it will be a classic exam we are

01:48:57
discussing how to do this so that it's challenging enough for you and also

01:49:05
not too difficult right so it's with the voice of an indeed. Has the Belgian

01:49:09
Brussels government have taken any action to prevent informal transportation. Do you know how

01:49:14
relaxed they are towards this? Well actually I researched these navets as they quote.

01:49:21
"Nelgo from midi to the shallower airport and no, the Brussels government is definitely not happy

01:49:30
about these informal tax, the situation there is that these men, all of them are are are are

01:49:37
Cameo, official taxi drivers, so they have a taxi license, but what they basically do is that

01:49:44
make more money, they offer individual seats in the vans and they taxi. And that's precisely what's

01:49:50
illegal. So you cannot, as a taxi driver in Brussels, you cannot basically stand there on the street

01:49:56
and try to approach potential passengers, offering them individual places in the car.

01:49:58
It has to be the whole car that is rented.

01:50:05
Well, it's a bit ironic, but what happened a few years after this practice

01:50:10
got into the focus of, I don't want to say, public debate, but basically these drivers

01:50:13
started being harassed by police and there was a legal procedure against them.

01:50:19
Flitco, I don't know if that name rings a bell. It's a company that runs the official bus

01:50:25
from me to Shalawa Airport, started exactly that. So they're basically now

01:50:31
offer well now it's standard but they started offering a van service which goes door to gate

01:50:36
as it's called and it picks individual passengers and individual seats are offered. And for

01:50:44
some reason this is perfectly legal whereas the taxi drivers are partly engaging in an illegal activity.

01:50:55
So just as a rebound you know why Flipkuh implemented this in a non-competitive way

01:50:59
why I mean is that they're actually more expensive than the Navet,

01:51:06
they're like informal and a bit. Because I think they have a very different customer target.

01:51:11
So people who would take a Navet, that's also from my own work, they would be very often

01:51:16
of immigrant backgrounds, so there's a lot of people from Eastern Europe, from Maccribe,

01:51:21
who are quite simply used to do this mode of transport for them. This is a very common thing to see

01:51:26
and use in the country of origin.

01:51:29
And also, the drivers of the Navet

01:51:32
would basically find the customers on the spot itself.

01:51:33
So you walked towards the bus.

01:51:35
I don't know if you've ever had that experience.

01:51:41
But whenever I had to walk to the bus of Flikko,

01:51:45
they would try to approach you and convince you to write with them.

01:51:48
Whereas I think people who use the internet

01:51:52
with access to a website who can know how to book a ride,

01:51:57
with a credit card to book a right, that's a different target group.

01:52:02
So maybe that's why if people can offer prices

01:52:05
which are not exactly competitive on the economic front.

01:52:11
Well, what it means that's the last sentence about an event

01:52:14
is that informality in this case,

01:52:17
it's some kind of a front for, in this case,

01:52:20
state institutions to define what's legal or not.

01:52:23
I mean, for them to decide that the naviet,

01:52:26
this informal drivers are informal and therefore legal.

01:52:29
I mean, it's an arbitrary decision

01:52:31
to decide that this is informal, whereas Uber is formal.

01:52:35
Or actually in the case of Uber,

01:52:37
and Brussels authorities,

01:52:41
the regional authorities pretend that Uber does not exist.

01:52:42
So they don't chase it away,

01:52:44
but they also don't promote it,

01:52:46
which is a perfect playground for Uber.

01:52:49
They are, they, that's exactly what they want.

01:52:55
They are not interested in being recognized as an official public transport service, for

01:53:00
example, because that would mean having to comply with a lot of regulations, which they

01:53:05
are of course not interested in complying with.

01:53:11
In your research about this, do you know if like Uber drivers partner up with the like

01:53:18
informal Navet drivers to actually try convince clients to use the informal Navet rather

01:53:20
than the Flipkop for example.

01:53:22
No, I don't know.

01:53:23
In this particular case, they definitely not.

01:53:27
I mean, the event drivers, as most taxi traffic

01:53:29
and bus will be hate over, they really

01:53:32
don't like that it exists because it basically

01:53:34
eats into the market.

01:53:39
I'm not saying that taxi drivers here are some angels

01:53:47
and most, I don't know, fun people to work with or on,

01:53:53
But they can also offer services which are overpriced

01:53:57
and try to rip off tourists and all of our young people

01:54:01
who come back home intoxicated by taking a very long route

01:54:01
or whatever.

01:54:03
With Uber, of course, the advantages

01:54:05
that you know the price before you get into the car,

01:54:07
more or less.

01:54:10
But in this case, no, there's definitely no collaboration.

01:54:15
I've said that there is some conflict even.

01:54:17
You've probably heard about not already

01:54:19
happened at least three times massive strikes

01:54:23
of taxi drivers against some kind of effort

01:54:26
towards regularizing Uber by the Russell's

01:54:28
and capital region authorities.

01:54:36
Any more questions, comments?

01:54:40
Well, it also goes without saying that at some point

01:54:44
will be picking topics for your master thesis.

01:54:47
And you are very welcome to pick some related

01:54:50
to transport and mobility, either supervised by me

01:54:51
or by other people.

01:54:54
There is some more in our team and in different departments

01:54:55
as well.

01:55:01
But I don't know if I succeeded, probably to some extent,

01:55:03
but not fully.

01:55:06
But if there was one thing that I really wanted you

01:55:08
to understand about transport and mobility

01:55:11
is that at least from the critical geographical perspective,

01:55:13
it's a really, really diverse field.

01:55:15
There's plenty of things to do.

01:55:19
And there's plenty of interesting things to do.

01:55:24
So I really look forward to seeing your research topics

01:55:26
and hope that at least some of them will be related

01:55:28
to transport availability.

01:55:32
If you need some little push or some encouragement,

01:55:34
we are always there to help you with finding

some interesting literature for inspiration or whatnot.

01:55:42
So, I really, really hope we meet in person one day.

01:55:45
I hope it's not too far in the future.

01:55:47
I really hope that we can do an excursion,

01:55:50
even though it's on the transport, it's interesting.

01:55:55
People say, so voila, I really hope that we can do that

01:55:58
in March, April, May, the latest.

01:56:03
So, until then, I wish you all the best with everything

01:56:05
and with the exam.

01:56:13
Good luck. Don't get discouraged by this online paradigm. It will be away soon. I hope.

01:56:20
So we will be in touch with you about the exam. Don't worry about it.

01:56:23
Enjoy. See you later.
