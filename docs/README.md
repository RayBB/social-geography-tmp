# 1 Introduction: Urban geographical tradition(s)

00:00:36
thank you

00:00:43
all right

00:00:45
welcome everybody

00:00:47
to

00:00:49
urban geography Urban social geography I

00:00:52
had to work a little bit to make the

00:00:55
live stream work I hope it does work

00:00:59
does anybody mind if I take off my mask

00:01:03
is that okay

00:01:05
if anybody's uncomfortable just let me

00:01:07
know

00:01:08
but I rely on my facial expressions

00:01:12
for Content uh how do you say that to

00:01:16
transfer content if you will

00:01:18
um so hi I'm David uh I'll be your

00:01:21
lecturer

00:01:22
and welcome to the course

00:01:25
um I'm very glad that we can

00:01:28
teach and have this uh in real life in

00:01:31
person

00:01:33
um I'll tell you more about

00:01:36
um the kind of hybrid character because

00:01:37
we'll also be recording the sessions and

00:01:40
live streaming this session

00:01:42
so I think the pandemic pandemic

00:01:45
conditions are still ongoing to allow if

00:01:49
you would doubt about any infection Etc

00:01:53
to follow the course remotely

00:01:56
uh I think this can be more evident I

00:02:00
think for the for the regular lectures

00:02:02
like we have today

00:02:04
um there's also a number of discussion

00:02:06
seminars there it will be a bit less

00:02:08
evident uh and there's also excursions

00:02:10
for some in there yeah I mean uh I can't

00:02:14
stream an Excursion uh but for the

00:02:17
lectures it will be an alternative and

00:02:18
you also have a recording at the end

00:02:22
um of the lecture series and this could

00:02:24
be an interesting instrument to study

00:02:27
um so yeah that's also how students have

00:02:30
used it last year

00:02:32
okay so what are the objectives of the

00:02:36
entire course urban geography or Urban

00:02:38
social geography well just summed up

00:02:41
there

00:02:42
I won't go too to deep into this uh just

00:02:45
here and now but just that you know what

00:02:47
you're signing up for uh for the people

00:02:50
that are still uh shopping around I

00:02:53
would say

00:02:54
um the objective of the course is to

00:02:56
give an introduction to key theoretical

00:02:58
debates in urban studies more

00:03:01
specifically uh focusing on spatial and

00:03:04
geographical dimensions hence it's not

00:03:07
um introduction to Urban studies but

00:03:09
introduction to Urban Geography

00:03:12
and and this is kind of uh kind of

00:03:16
signaling what we find important as

00:03:17
lecturers

00:03:19
to adopt a theoretically pluralist

00:03:21
approach toward Urban studies

00:03:24
you'll see that and I'll get to that in

00:03:26
a second that we work with different

00:03:27
teachers lectures we all have their own

00:03:30
backgrounds and they may be slightly

00:03:32
different some people work more on a

00:03:34
political economy perspective others

00:03:36
start from adopting a perspective from

00:03:39
diversity ethnicity yet others are

00:03:42
interested in

00:03:43
uh issues of culture then the broad

00:03:47
sense and others work in a kind of

00:03:49
Mobility framework and we'll try to

00:03:51
bring those things together in one

00:03:54
course but what is kind of uniting the

00:03:57
course that I think a spatial social

00:03:58
spatial understanding of contemporary

00:04:01
cities okay so that's what you're

00:04:04
signing up for if you hate cities this

00:04:06
is the moment to leave the room

00:04:09
um I Told You So So This Is The Old Mill

00:04:13
panel

00:04:15
um that we present you my sincerest

00:04:17
apologies

00:04:19
um but I think that hopefully diversity

00:04:21
across the curriculum is a bit better

00:04:24
than within this course but

00:04:27
um we're selecting from the people that

00:04:30
that can teach so please accept my

00:04:33
apologies for that but still we hope

00:04:35
that we can inform you from a range of

00:04:38
perspectives uh also including I would

00:04:41
say feminist perspectives and they will

00:04:44
pop up here and there

00:04:45
especially when we start talking about

00:04:48
issues of culture and issues of mobility

00:04:52
and transmit but you see those

00:04:53
Dimensions returning so who is part of

00:04:56
the teaching team well that's next few

00:04:59
months he's an expert in issues of

00:05:02
segregation and living in diversity both

00:05:05
from her

00:05:06
he is an expert you could say in

00:05:09
Creative Industries cultural geographies

00:05:11
of the cities of the city boytech

00:05:14
goblovsky

00:05:15
he wrote a PhD on fairfree public

00:05:19
transportation and he's an expert in

00:05:22
urban studies slash transportation

00:05:25
geographies and recently is really

00:05:28
pushing for kind of the colonial

00:05:31
agenda in transport geographies and

00:05:34
finally there's me

00:05:36
um I Won't Say I'm an expert in anything

00:05:38
I'm an expert in coordinating this

00:05:40
course by now uh and I come from a

00:05:43
background of world and Global cities so

00:05:46
what happens to cities amid

00:05:48
globalization uh how should we study

00:05:52
that analyze that well on the main

00:05:53
debates

00:05:54
and personally I've been looking a lot

00:05:57
into the geographies of Islamic Finance

00:06:01
as a way to understand I would say

00:06:03
Middle Eastern processes of urbanization

00:06:06
but that was my PhD currently I'm more

00:06:09
working in teams around Financial

00:06:11
geographies more widely thinking about

00:06:14
what typifies Global cities as command

00:06:17
and control centers all kind of things

00:06:19
that I'll be killing you with in the

00:06:21
next few sessions so I won't say

00:06:24
anything more about that so that's the

00:06:26
teaching team

00:06:27
and so this plural voices to some extent

00:06:32
and also there's also a plural audience

00:06:36
um so I was already referring to groups

00:06:39
of students uh by pointing to that this

00:06:42
is the urban social geography course but

00:06:44
also it's also the urban geography

00:06:45
Course and there are slight differences

00:06:48
between both courses but especially for

00:06:50
uh the lectures that makes complete

00:06:54
sense

00:06:54
um to to bring you together in a room so

00:06:57
we have the master in urban studies they

00:07:00
will be a master please raise your hands

00:07:02
and voices

00:07:05
okay thanks for the hands

00:07:08
uh this for citizens

00:07:11
yeah so that's even more exotic these

00:07:14
people travel around Europe in the next

00:07:16
two years

00:07:18
uh then we have our own exotic species

00:07:21
uh from The Bachelor of geography uh

00:07:25
maybe raise your hand

00:07:27
welcome and we also have

00:07:30
um urbanists in the room

00:07:33
um so please show me where you are these

00:07:36
people also combine this with with an

00:07:38
actual job uh so that's also why we

00:07:42
teach at night to accommodate that and

00:07:46
these are people that have quite a bit

00:07:47
of professional expertise so I would say

00:07:49
this is already a global Urban map here

00:07:53
uh confined in this room

00:07:56
um I would say enjoy this mix and try to

00:07:59
pick each other's brains as much as

00:08:02
possible I think just by comparing Urban

00:08:04
experiences

00:08:06
Supreme casual conversation you can

00:08:08
already learn quite a bit I would say

00:08:12
so similarities

00:08:14
um

00:08:15
all students have lectures and

00:08:19
discussion seminars this discussion

00:08:22
seminar for capacity reasons will be

00:08:24
split but I'll tell you more about that

00:08:26
for urban social geographers so that's

00:08:29
what mass and urban studies and for

00:08:31
Citizens we're kind of new to Belgium

00:08:34
uh we also offer kinds of excursions and

00:08:38
I'll say more about that as well and

00:08:40
these are mandatory fun

00:08:44
so how does the course look like uh

00:08:47
there's nine lectures

00:08:50
which we will try to make as interactive

00:08:52
as possible but there will be a degree

00:08:55
of me and US telling you stuff the

00:08:58
discussion seminars will be way more uh

00:09:02
flipped if you will where the content is

00:09:04
prepared by by you and then we discuss

00:09:08
this in the classroom so it's a bit of a

00:09:10
give and take there

00:09:13
we organized the

00:09:15
um the lectures in modules so you could

00:09:18
say there's four modules one organized

00:09:21
by me which deals with a general

00:09:24
introduction as you'll note today and

00:09:27
then we'll delve into theories

00:09:30
of world and Global cities looking at

00:09:34
what explains their Genesis what their

00:09:37
characteristics are uh why it matters

00:09:39
and what kind of the main processes are

00:09:42
that characterize Urban Societies in

00:09:46
world and Global cities and one of the

00:09:48
main debates there is

00:09:50
to what extent are these places

00:09:52
polarized

00:09:54
either in terms of ethnicity income

00:09:57
levels professional levels Etc

00:10:01
with depth Sensitivity I would say to

00:10:05
uneven is within cities uh I'll pass on

00:10:08
the word to an experiments

00:10:10
we'll focus more on processes of urban

00:10:13
segregation we're looking at the spatial

00:10:15
processes behind that

00:10:18
and one of the main debates I would say

00:10:20
in uh issues of diversity and ethnicity

00:10:23
is to what extent there are neighborhood

00:10:27
effects

00:10:28
is the fact that you live within a

00:10:30
certain neighborhood affecting your

00:10:33
future trajectories life chances Etc so

00:10:36
that's one of the main debates there and

00:10:40
there's pros and cons there's Arguments

00:10:43
for and against the existence of

00:10:45
neighborhood effects

00:10:48
um then we passed on to uh boss from

00:10:50
Hood who will be talking about uh you

00:10:52
could say the cultural approach

00:10:55
uh thinking about different cultures of

00:10:58
urban research and then so this deals

00:11:01
with various methods and mostly with you

00:11:03
could say uh an older cultural turn uh

00:11:06
within geography in the social sciences

00:11:08
more widely which was took place after

00:11:11
the second world war and then more

00:11:13
recently in the 80s and 90s okay the

00:11:15
real cultural turn where was all about

00:11:19
um a turn towards more qualitative

00:11:21
research methods other sources uh that

00:11:24
that could be studied and that could

00:11:26
serve the study herbis Urban societies

00:11:29
and then this is also mobilized in the

00:11:32
study of urban cultures where it's about

00:11:33
creative Industries the lives of artists

00:11:36
Etc which is a big element in a lot of

00:11:39
I'd say discourses on the creative city

00:11:42
as you may know the work of Richard

00:11:44
Florida it was all hype I would say 20

00:11:47
years ago that all cities should be

00:11:50
geared toward becoming creative in one

00:11:53
way or another so hence also large focus

00:11:56
on the literature on issues of arts and

00:11:59
culture as it is connected to the issues

00:12:01
of Urban Development

00:12:04
and the final part is with vojtek

00:12:07
blovsky

00:12:08
looking into through the lens of of

00:12:13
transport and mobility and what we can

00:12:15
learn about cities and he will be

00:12:18
talking about different kinds of agendas

00:12:21
that's typify I would say

00:12:24
transport studies all the way from

00:12:27
neoclassical views that connected to

00:12:29
Urban growth development to

00:12:33
sustainability issues which is a

00:12:35
paradigm in an office Zone and then

00:12:37
he'll be yeah drawing on his own

00:12:40
research looking more into what he calls

00:12:43
critical perspectives on Urban transport

00:12:45
where it's all about yeah who actually

00:12:48
benefits from the current Transportation

00:12:51
regime what are issues of inequality who

00:12:54
makes uh decisions about in Transport

00:12:57
Systems Etc so

00:12:59
I think by the end you should have a

00:13:01
kind of a 360 degree overview of uh of

00:13:06
debates in urban geography obviously

00:13:09
um we don't know everything far from

00:13:12
that so it's a selection of debates

00:13:15
um we could generate another curriculum

00:13:18
based with other forms of expertise but

00:13:21
it's also an exercise in trying to

00:13:24
um critically triangulate different

00:13:25
perspectives on the city through

00:13:27
different kind of tips which come with

00:13:29
their own methodologies Etc so that's uh

00:13:33
the setup of the course

00:13:35
and these take place here uh you just

00:13:38
about fit in this room so I'm extremely

00:13:41
happy and pleased and will take place on

00:13:45
Mondays between five and seven

00:13:48
um let's see what the quality of the

00:13:50
streaming is uh I if I would open

00:13:53
panopto which is my program I could

00:13:55
expect a stream of comments about that

00:13:57
but so I'll evaluate that but the the

00:14:00
idea is that everything is streamed as

00:14:03
well people that can't make it because

00:14:05
of yeah conflicts with work

00:14:08
um or well they might have time but

00:14:11
can't reach VB because it's immediately

00:14:13
uh after uh the working day I mean I

00:14:17
would understand that you would

00:14:19
um yeah follow remotely

00:14:22
um and sessions will also be recorded

00:14:25
on the other hand it's a kind of strict

00:14:27
recommendation to try to be here as much

00:14:30
as possible because I mean one of the

00:14:33
insights from the corona crisis yeah

00:14:36
when you watch remotely sometimes it's

00:14:40
hard to maintain discipline I also

00:14:42
recognize that with all kinds of zoomy

00:14:45
things and zoom

00:14:47
um I don't know seminars

00:14:49
so having a habit of coming to vud

00:14:53
coming to class I think it's also a way

00:14:55
to stay connected not only to the course

00:14:57
content but also to one another so

00:14:59
you could uh fall back on this but I

00:15:01
would not recommend uh a full digital

00:15:04
semester uh in any case so but it's it's

00:15:08
there and it will be your resource if

00:15:10
all goes well uh at the very end

00:15:15
so yeah we're here

00:15:18
a bit more on the discussion seminar so

00:15:21
yes please there was a question

00:15:23
foreign

00:15:27
yeah it's to have some slack uh in this

00:15:31
room we'll aim for two hours but we

00:15:34
already started like five minutes late

00:15:36
today

00:15:38
um so don't uh be upset if we take until

00:15:42
10 past seven but the idea is that it

00:15:45
would be two hours

00:15:47
um yeah depends a bit on what happens

00:15:49
yes

00:15:53
Excuse me

00:15:56
yes I'll post them online after each

00:15:59
session

00:16:00
um

00:16:01
yeah and if you go to the canvas page

00:16:04
and I guess some of you are not yet

00:16:08
uh be able to access uh come with us but

00:16:11
that should be resorted quite soon

00:16:13
you'll see at the starting page and I

00:16:17
made all kinds of modules there's a kind

00:16:19
of an outline module and there's a

00:16:21
module per session

00:16:22
where you'll see

00:16:25
um the required readings some additional

00:16:28
readings outposts a link to

00:16:31
um no I won't do it there I'll post a

00:16:34
link to the recordings any announcements

00:16:36
there will be session slides linked to

00:16:40
um to each of these modules so I mean I

00:16:43
think it's neatly organized so you

00:16:45
should find your way there basically all

00:16:47
content will be provided online for

00:16:50
people that cannot access

00:16:53
um canvas yet

00:16:56
please find somebody who has access and

00:16:59
try to share I would say the course

00:17:01
outline

00:17:03
um so please be aware that some of you

00:17:05
don't have access yet I think by next

00:17:08
week it should be okay

00:17:11
so yeah let's see

00:17:13
so yeah next to the lectures

00:17:17
um there's discussion seminars where we

00:17:19
basically use the reader

00:17:22
um to advance our insights into these

00:17:25
discussions around urban geography and

00:17:27
we take the various modules so four

00:17:30
modules and we organize that in one

00:17:31
block where we'll have a discussion

00:17:34
which is basically prepared by uo and

00:17:37
different kind of smaller presentations

00:17:39
and then we have a collective discussion

00:17:42
about

00:17:43
uh it's also in the outline so it's a

00:17:46
different kind of series of discussion

00:17:48
seminars because you can't have a debate

00:17:50
with 200 people in the room

00:17:52
uh so it's more like a classroom format

00:17:55
uh one for the master in urban studies

00:17:57
one track for four cities and then uh

00:18:01
also one for geographers and urbanists

00:18:03
and one go

00:18:05
um for mus and for cities it won't be on

00:18:08
Mondays it's on different times uh

00:18:10
during the week it's in uh your time

00:18:13
schedule

00:18:14
please check uh if you've already

00:18:17
identified where the time schedule is

00:18:19
also when the room information is

00:18:23
um and try to notice down in your agenda

00:18:25
because there will be an assignment

00:18:26
later that a small one but I would say

00:18:29
an important one okay please note that

00:18:31
down in your return

00:18:35
um also note that the lectures at some

00:18:39
point will have three lectures now but

00:18:40
then we will Skip One Week

00:18:43
uh before we go to the next module then

00:18:46
two classes then we Skip One Week etc

00:18:48
etc and it is because on certain Mondays

00:18:51
after module will have a discussion

00:18:54
seminar with geographers and urbanists

00:18:57
because it's we can't expect work

00:19:00
students to be here during the day

00:19:03
um so we will take these Mondays and

00:19:05
also please take notes for uh

00:19:08
myths and four cities that you don't

00:19:10
have to show up for I would say four

00:19:13
sessions uh on Mondays I mean you're

00:19:15
welcome to join uh but there will be no

00:19:18
lectures there will be discussion

00:19:19
seminars for another group okay just so

00:19:22
you know it could be a week also to

00:19:24
prepare a little bit more uh for the

00:19:26
discussion seminar that you you may have

00:19:28
yourself

00:19:29
okay I'll say more about the assignment

00:19:32
link to that in a second then Urban

00:19:34
social geography excursions uh there's a

00:19:37
lot of administration here apparently

00:19:40
um

00:19:40
we offer four excursions but because of

00:19:43
the size of the group this is for Miss

00:19:45
and for cities uh we'll have to

00:19:49
um yeah force you to make a short Choice

00:19:53
um so there's four excursions one uh led

00:19:55
by me here in Brussels which deal with

00:19:57
Brussels as a global City uh next few

00:20:00
months takes you to Antwerp to deal with

00:20:02
issues of Social and ethnic segregation

00:20:05
Minds that this is a bike trip so maybe

00:20:08
some of you are less comfortable with uh

00:20:11
biking just taken to this into account

00:20:13
others may be extremely experienced and

00:20:15
fight the rates uh too slow and also

00:20:18
don't want to join

00:20:20
um then there's an Excursion to show

00:20:22
everyone Again by Nick

00:20:25
and then wojtek will take you on

00:20:28
Excursion in Brussels around the team of

00:20:30
everyday Mobility

00:20:34
um so for excursions you have to choose

00:20:36
two

00:20:37
um this is also something that I I um

00:20:40
mentioned in this uh Google Sheets or

00:20:43
spreadsheets

00:20:45
um please try to go for one Brussels

00:20:48
Excursion and one other Excursion

00:20:50
because we want to kind of give

00:20:51
everybody the opportunity to go beyond

00:20:54
Brussels otherwise your remain stuck in

00:20:56
the Brussels bubble uh so there's please

00:20:59
select either Antwerp I would say or

00:21:01
either Charlotte yes the hunter bike

00:21:06
trip is actually like right here by

00:21:09
people from Russell's pointer no okay

00:21:13
you go by train and then

00:21:16
I don't think it's even the entire day

00:21:19
but at some point you'll go to the

00:21:21
locked Bowl which is kind of a

00:21:24
social housing product project from I

00:21:27
think the 60s if I'm not mistaken uh and

00:21:31
to reach that you'll go by by bike

00:21:34
um

00:21:35
yeah some people feel less comfortable

00:21:37
doing that uh

00:21:39
you could also say we have uh one month

00:21:42
to get trained uh so in any case it

00:21:46
could be an opportunity but take this

00:21:48
into account uh yes it was a question

00:21:51
and bring our own way no no no no no no

00:21:55
no no no no yeah well there's a bike

00:21:58
rental yeah Nick has arranged bikes are

00:22:01
there any other questions about this

00:22:07
uh not yet no uh but typically I mean

00:22:11
this would be communicated they start in

00:22:13
the early morning and the end at the end

00:22:15
of the day

00:22:16
um

00:22:17
yeah so it's a full day

00:22:19
see

00:22:21
okay

00:22:23
so please uh go to this um spreadsheet

00:22:28
and fill out your preferences

00:22:34
all right

00:22:40
okay I hope this uh the skills it

00:22:44
and fill out your preferences uh as soon

00:22:47
as possible and no later than next week

00:22:51
okay so there's limited capacity for

00:22:53
each of these

00:22:55
um excursions

00:22:57
so please uh take care of it

00:23:00
all right a bit more about the course

00:23:03
materials

00:23:05
um as you will see on canvas there's a

00:23:09
reader with what I call required reading

00:23:12
so I expect everybody

00:23:14
reach this at least once and preferably

00:23:17
in advance of advance of each lecture

00:23:20
it's a kind of way to keep track of of

00:23:22
the discussion

00:23:24
and there will also be additional

00:23:25
readings and these additional readings

00:23:27
will kind of be the resource that we

00:23:29
will use in the discussion seminars

00:23:32
[Music]

00:23:33
um

00:23:33
yeah the rest I've said already

00:23:36
um session slides and recordings

00:23:38
available after each session

00:23:41
and then this is weird and then

00:23:45
um yeah you'll have access via compost a

00:23:48
bit more about evaluation and great

00:23:50
distribution

00:23:52
so this assignment in the discussion

00:23:55
seminar

00:23:56
um is

00:23:58
um a critical summary and it accounts

00:24:02
for one-fifth of your total grade so

00:24:05
it's a kind of uh

00:24:07
a way to to be remunerated if you will

00:24:09
for your efforts during the semester but

00:24:12
the whole idea is that we digest our way

00:24:15
through

00:24:16
the literature and through the reader

00:24:18
that we do this in a collective way

00:24:22
um so what is the assignment

00:24:25
um all students have to read the

00:24:27
required readings but then

00:24:30
um

00:24:34
I have no idea what to do actually

00:24:38
uh let me just check this is off

00:24:45
[Music]

00:24:56
yeah no idea

00:25:01
okay let's let's just try to continue

00:25:05
um

00:25:06
so part two you'll be invited to

00:25:08
critically summarize one additional

00:25:11
reading so it could be a paper on Beirut

00:25:14
for instance when we're talking about

00:25:16
global cities

00:25:18
and

00:25:19
um

00:25:21
yeah I'll announce the schedule uh for

00:25:24
that you'll have 10 minutes of

00:25:25
presentation

00:25:27
and what you're asked to do is that you

00:25:30
focus on a core quote or uh passage or

00:25:33
excerpt from the text that you kind of

00:25:36
use this as an introduction to the text

00:25:37
that you tell us all about the main

00:25:40
argument of the authors

00:25:42
that you connect this to The Wider

00:25:45
debate to the literature that we've been

00:25:46
discussing yeah we've been talking about

00:25:48
world and Global cities yeah what how do

00:25:51
you connect that to this particular

00:25:54
study that we're reading about and then

00:25:56
toward the end you want to give some

00:25:58
kind of a critical critical reflection

00:26:00
so you can also start with the critical

00:26:02
reflection and weave that through the

00:26:04
entire presentation but you should end

00:26:06
with a number of discussion questions uh

00:26:09
which we can use to kick start the

00:26:12
debate so 10 minutes you give kind of a

00:26:14
crash course summary of what the paper

00:26:18
is about why it matters what we learn

00:26:20
from it and how we connect that to to

00:26:24
the discussions that we already have

00:26:27
so that's the critical summary a bit

00:26:29
more on that second I'm sorry

00:26:33
yes okay yeah because otherwise it will

00:26:36
be an endless stream of presentations

00:26:39
it's something that you can do with two

00:26:42
um so yeah it's a and and both of you

00:26:44
should uh take the floor at some point

00:26:47
yeah so the idea is that it's a bit of a

00:26:49
balanced exercise and also try to make

00:26:52
this an integrated exercise not somebody

00:26:56
one person saying okay this is the

00:26:58
argument but then the other person not

00:27:00
knowing the argument but having come up

00:27:02
with with the neural questions so to

00:27:03
give a stupid example that's not the

00:27:05
idea so it really try to discuss the

00:27:06
text together and come to some kind of a

00:27:10
shared understanding there and already

00:27:11
debating this amongst the two of you

00:27:14
would already be something worthwhile I

00:27:16
think

00:27:18
yeah

00:27:20
yeah the largest part of the evaluation

00:27:22
is a written exam

00:27:24
and this is basically

00:27:27
um a way to test you could say your

00:27:30
knowledge of urban of the urban theories

00:27:32
and Concepts that we've been discussing

00:27:34
throughout the semester throughout the

00:27:37
different modules

00:27:38
there's no uh particular focus on

00:27:42
memorizing things by heart but it's

00:27:45
about

00:27:47
mobilizing your knowledge to study

00:27:50
empirical examples cases Etc

00:27:53
and I think we'll give examples of that

00:27:56
throughout the course

00:27:59
for instance when you think about

00:28:01
[Music]

00:28:02
um

00:28:03
culture as an as a

00:28:07
say Urban Development strategy you may

00:28:09
get a question about okay there's a new

00:28:12
soundtrack

00:28:15
next to the Brussels Canal Zone to what

00:28:19
extent is this a a case of cultural and

00:28:23
regeneration

00:28:25
discuss and then you would would have to

00:28:28
interpret the case on that base so it's

00:28:31
not just about reproduction that's about

00:28:34
applying what you've learned critically

00:28:36
reflecting on the different concepts Etc

00:28:39
and you'll use the readings the slides

00:28:42
the recordings personal notes from

00:28:45
seminars and lectures and yeah those who

00:28:48
went on a disc on an Excursion can also

00:28:51
always refer to

00:28:54
um to the filters to actually get a bit

00:28:58
of more inspiration

00:29:00
so that's uh the setup of the great

00:29:03
distribution

00:29:05
um and yeah a bit more still about this

00:29:08
critical summary

00:29:10
um just a number of questions that you

00:29:12
could use as a source of information

00:29:15
inspiration or a template

00:29:17
so what is the key message from the

00:29:21
paper why is it important what is the

00:29:23
key argument uh what have you learned

00:29:26
and really try to be as nuanced as

00:29:28
possible can you compare the argument

00:29:31
being made with other perspectives or a

00:29:34
perspective from the required readings

00:29:36
or anything

00:29:40
foreign

00:29:41
important

00:29:43
yeah this is getting a bit weird now

00:29:54
yeah I have no idea

00:29:59
when I move I have the impression

00:30:03
um

00:30:04
okay let's try uh to continue

00:30:14
[Music]

00:30:22
yeah okay

00:30:25
I wonder what would happen if I would

00:30:27
push the out button but then I think

00:30:30
maybe

00:30:31
you know it might be singles or

00:30:33
something

00:30:34
yeah okay

00:30:36
do you really think that would be the

00:30:38
case yeah

00:30:39
yeah interference but everybody switch

00:30:42
off their phones is that an option it's

00:30:45
like 100 phones being switched off is

00:30:48
that possible to try yeah

00:30:52
but I don't really find it I think it's

00:30:55
necessary

00:30:56
yeah

00:30:58
but yeah

00:31:00
I think that's the most I can do

00:31:03
actually

00:31:06
maybe yeah let's try okay maybe we'll

00:31:09
have to live with it or I can sort it

00:31:12
out later

00:31:14
um

00:31:21
what happens if I

00:31:23
go this one

00:31:29
foreign

00:31:36
[Music]

00:31:57
excuse me

00:32:01
unknowingly

00:32:03
okay I'm not a genius this is clear by

00:32:06
now

00:32:08
um

00:32:08
all right uh and um yeah final point

00:32:12
that I already set this uh try something

00:32:15
um the debate that's that's what uh what

00:32:18
it's all about in the end okay

00:32:22
no you have to do this one

00:32:25
one so what I'll do as soon as I have

00:32:27
the full overviews who had actually

00:32:28
taking this course but make a schedule

00:32:31
uh and then you'll have to present once

00:32:34
yeah with somebody else

00:32:37
um

00:32:43
campus or

00:32:45
um it's not on canvas it's a different

00:32:47
kind of Google Sheets but you can click

00:32:50
the link in the in the slides that I

00:32:53
just uh showed so yeah

00:33:00
um

00:33:02
for those who don't have access to

00:33:04
converse uh maybe ask somebody who has

00:33:07
to share this link or just ask somebody

00:33:10
to to sign you up uh via this link

00:33:13
um okay

00:33:15
is that clear

00:33:17
there's a whole lot of administration

00:33:19
sorry for that uh but that's how it goes

00:33:23
I guess so I hope everything is clear

00:33:25
yes please

00:33:34
yeah but I'll make the the distribution

00:33:37
oh yeah because otherwise if we do this

00:33:40
bottom up then

00:33:42
it will be very very difficult uh so

00:33:45
I'll yeah but all texts are interesting

00:33:48
I would say

00:33:50
um

00:33:51
so so that's the idea but uh it might

00:33:54
take a while because I think for for

00:33:56
most and four cities it's quite clear so

00:33:58
that could go fast maybe for geographers

00:34:00
and uh stat it could last a little bit

00:34:04
longer because sometimes it's unclear

00:34:05
who is actually in the course but for

00:34:07
most unfortunately I think this can go

00:34:08
actually quite fast and then you can

00:34:10
also plan a little bit uh work in the

00:34:13
semester

00:34:14
um okay

00:34:16
together

00:34:17
all right

00:34:19
so uh let's turn to some content then

00:34:23
uh and let's start our trip

00:34:26
what we'll be discussing in Earth today

00:34:29
is basically what we'll do is we'll

00:34:32
deconstruct uh the title course

00:34:37
um and ask four questions

00:34:40
what is the Urban

00:34:42
what is the city

00:34:45
what is geography

00:34:47
and what does it mean when I say I'm

00:34:50
critical

00:34:52
arguably critical is not in the title

00:34:54
but it could have been right

00:34:56
it may seem consensible but I think

00:35:00
asking these very blue sky questions

00:35:03
perhaps uh could get us closer to an

00:35:06
understanding what urban geography is

00:35:07
about so you can also start already

00:35:09
start thinking a little bit about

00:35:12
what we would mean with the term the

00:35:14
urban and uh the city

00:35:18
maybe as I take you to a number of

00:35:21
exhibits you can draw some inspiration

00:35:24
for that and you can make a list and

00:35:26
then in a few minutes you'll be invited

00:35:28
to write a very short one minute paper

00:35:31
it doesn't have to be Pros where you

00:35:33
collect a little bit of ideas on what

00:35:35
those two terms could be okay

00:35:41
probably and one of the reasons why some

00:35:44
of you have studied uh or selected the

00:35:48
master in urban studies for four cities

00:35:49
is because you have been seduced by a

00:35:54
discourse or a frame of we live in the

00:35:57
urban age processes occur increasingly

00:36:00
in cities therefore we need to

00:36:02
understand cities if we want to make

00:36:04
sense of our futures or something like

00:36:06
that and this would be some kind of a

00:36:09
framework or repertoire

00:36:11
um that the world uh that United Nations

00:36:14
sorry calls a framework of the urban age

00:36:19
and it's a kind of frame that says well

00:36:22
we've long been a you could say rural

00:36:25
global population or a rural species but

00:36:29
at some point and someday in 2005 we

00:36:33
became an urban species and ever since

00:36:36
uh basically world population growth

00:36:39
will be Urban growth so increasingly we

00:36:43
are undergoing as a global Society a

00:36:46
process of urbanization where more and

00:36:48
more people

00:36:49
become Urban so this kind of Mantra of

00:36:53
the urban age has been around since

00:36:56
about 2007 so immediately after this

00:37:00
historical Urban transition

00:37:02
and it has been repeated as a kind of a

00:37:05
motivation for increased attention at

00:37:08
the cities so and there's something

00:37:10
behind that obviously because there is

00:37:13
indeed a transition to the urban and

00:37:16
this observable here empirically roughly

00:37:19
in the 1950s about 70 percent of of the

00:37:22
population global population lived in

00:37:25
rural areas and only 30 percent in urban

00:37:29
areas it was 50 50 apparently around

00:37:33
2005 and now it's reversed uh or it's

00:37:37
going to be reversed by 2050 expectation

00:37:40
is that 70 of the global population will

00:37:43
live in cities okay

00:37:46
so that's kind of the framework of the

00:37:49
urban age that is very much kind of uh

00:37:53
projected by the United Nations by all

00:37:55
kinds of uh world uh World reports and

00:38:00
that is kind of taken over by both

00:38:02
critical and more uncritical uh voices

00:38:05
in the debate

00:38:06
McKinsey would also use this to argue

00:38:09
for more consultancy into uh urban

00:38:12
government or something

00:38:14
but it's just as much Mike Davis when he

00:38:18
talks about uh cities of slums he'll use

00:38:21
this as a critical framework to refer to

00:38:24
make his kind of his work important

00:38:28
so what is behind this is an assumed

00:38:30
process or an identifiable process of

00:38:34
globalized urbanization so the process

00:38:37
by which

00:38:38
the urban condition if you will is

00:38:41
becoming a global phenomenon

00:38:44
and urbanization used to be something

00:38:47
that was not Global at all and if you

00:38:50
look at a few maps by Michael patrolling

00:38:53
uh who has a great handbook uh on on

00:38:57
cities

00:38:59
you see that it was very much say a

00:39:01
Western European or Northern American

00:39:04
Affair so UK

00:39:08
was extremely urbanized European

00:39:11
continents

00:39:12
also quite and the us as well apparently

00:39:16
Alaska was also extremely urbanized

00:39:20
the rest of the world was on the map but

00:39:23
not really on the map of urbanization uh

00:39:27
it didn't occurred there

00:39:31
fast forward to the 1950s you see that

00:39:33
this process is spreading uh especially

00:39:36
you could say throughout the European

00:39:38
continents throughout the Commonwealth

00:39:40
you see Australia and Canada popping up

00:39:44
also I could say more

00:39:47
developmentalists say to Latin America

00:39:50
uh USSR

00:39:53
and uh to a very very limited extent uh

00:39:57
Africa and then especially the market

00:40:01
not so much in Asia as you can see

00:40:05
we're moving forward 1990s

00:40:08
we see that this process is both

00:40:10
extending geographically and I uh

00:40:14
intensified so a lot of countries or

00:40:17
quite a few countries in Europe have now

00:40:20
an urbanization rate apparently between

00:40:22
80 and 100 percent which is kind of the

00:40:25
ratio between population that lives in

00:40:28
cities on the total population so

00:40:31
between 80 and 100 of people live in

00:40:34
cities according to these definitions

00:40:37
again note Australia uh it's a

00:40:40
tremendously urbanized uh continent if

00:40:45
you will obviously this is a projection

00:40:47
of the ratio on the entire territory

00:40:50
okay so uh almost all Australians live

00:40:54
in cities but that doesn't mean that the

00:40:57
entirety of Australia is a city okay

00:40:59
Maps could lie to some extent okay so we

00:41:04
may be exaggerating some things when we

00:41:06
think about uh

00:41:08
I don't know the use of Natural

00:41:10
Resources or environmental impact uh

00:41:14
that's that's something that we could

00:41:15
think about

00:41:17
um what is also important is kind of a

00:41:19
different kind of figure is that there's

00:41:22
some kind of a decoupling between

00:41:23
processes of

00:41:25
one of a better word uh economic growth

00:41:28
or what some people call uh more

00:41:31
problematically development

00:41:33
and urbanization when you go back to say

00:41:37
the history of urbanization in the 19th

00:41:39
century it was a pro a process that was

00:41:42
intimately linked to industrialization

00:41:45
economic growth but also obviously as we

00:41:48
know uneven development within Western

00:41:51
European cities

00:41:53
there was a lot of economic development

00:41:55
in the UK cities like Manchester uh

00:41:59
because there was a boom of the textile

00:42:01
industry it led to economic growth but

00:42:04
it also led to huge uh Urban

00:42:06
inequalities but in any case at the

00:42:09
aggregate level you could say at the

00:42:11
level of the country or the city there

00:42:13
was an economic Improvement

00:42:15
and that connected to the growth of

00:42:18
these cities

00:42:19
what you find in you could say the last

00:42:22
20 years and this has something to do

00:42:24
with all kinds of neoliberal policies

00:42:27
that work at the global scale especially

00:42:30
when you talk about Asia and

00:42:32
Africa you could say

00:42:35
um uh the Strategic adjustment plans

00:42:37
that have been rolled out there by uh

00:42:41
organizations such as the international

00:42:43
monetary fund and its sister or brother

00:42:46
the World Bank which has basic basically

00:42:49
opened up the borders of these conflict

00:42:51
countries to foreign investment as this

00:42:53
would uh Kickstart growth okay

00:42:56
in reality one could argue that this has

00:42:59
produced produced a dependent form of

00:43:02
growth or you could say an exploitative

00:43:05
relation between the global periphery

00:43:08
and the global core okay but at the same

00:43:12
time has initiated and this is kind of

00:43:14
the argument by Mike Davis an implosion

00:43:17
of the countryside rural living in these

00:43:20
places

00:43:22
um became untenable because a lot of uh

00:43:26
it's a subsidized activities or

00:43:28
state-controlled activities were rolled

00:43:30
back for instance in agriculture this

00:43:32
led to huge deprivation on the

00:43:34
countryside and in varying degrees a

00:43:38
search to go for the battle better life

00:43:40
than in a lot of African majoriences

00:43:43
Okay so

00:43:44
if we thought that it could be a sign of

00:43:47
Economic Development we could say in the

00:43:50
19th century and even if we take up with

00:43:52
a pinch of salt that's still not

00:43:54
possible to say in uh when you talk

00:43:57
about urbanization rates for instance in

00:43:59
in Africa or parts of Asia okay

00:44:04
now uh so and if you look at the rates

00:44:08
of urbanization we're talking about

00:44:09
seven to eight percent in some uh

00:44:12
sub-Saharan African countries whereas if

00:44:15
you look at the older industrial areas

00:44:19
or urbanized areas it's somewhere

00:44:21
between one and two percent still growth

00:44:23
so we're doubling I would say in 36

00:44:26
years uh if it's two percent uh but far

00:44:29
far less

00:44:31
um

00:44:33
so yes globalized urbanization that also

00:44:36
shows when you look at the hit list of

00:44:39
largest cities

00:44:41
um it was very much uh euro-american if

00:44:45
you will

00:44:46
uh the industrial heart heartlands some

00:44:50
exceptions Shanghai for instance uh

00:44:53
Japan

00:44:54
1950s but then it starts to really

00:44:58
diversify and become actually a matter

00:45:01
of not Euro America but Asia Latin

00:45:07
America Etc and a number of leading

00:45:09
cities in terms of population

00:45:11
in the 1950s now well down the list to

00:45:14
take New York for instance others okay

00:45:17
so this is kind of the thesis that

00:45:19
urbanization is now a globalized

00:45:22
phenomenon there's still different kind

00:45:25
of patterns behind that just you can

00:45:29
look into this at home because it may be

00:45:31
a bit small to actually read here

00:45:34
um

00:45:36
some places when you look at Europe uh

00:45:38
we're talking about 80 urbanization

00:45:41
still in Africa despite its uh large

00:45:45
urbanization rate

00:45:48
still foremost a rural Society so even

00:45:52
this despite a kind of a global

00:45:54
transition toward globalized

00:45:56
urbanization that's quite a bit of

00:45:58
regional differences that we need to

00:46:00
take into account

00:46:02
and that brings me to the next slide

00:46:04
this famous image that I stole it from

00:46:08
Neil Brenner uh uh where Batman beats

00:46:12
the crap out of Robin because he begins

00:46:14
to talk about

00:46:16
um this urban urban age again I think

00:46:19
it's a moment to really uh question

00:46:22
critically what is meant by the urban

00:46:25
agent to what extent we should really

00:46:27
believe and go along in this Urban age

00:46:29
frame and and a very nice paper I

00:46:33
haven't put it in the reader because

00:46:34
there's already quite a bit of of things

00:46:37
in there

00:46:38
is a paper by a new Brenner and

00:46:40
Christian Smith from 2014.

00:46:44
and they really deconstruct uh this

00:46:47
narrative and they point to two elements

00:46:49
one is

00:46:52
the notion or the idea uh or the

00:46:55
observation that we're living in the

00:46:57
urban age could be a statistical

00:46:59
artifact so it's a matter of how we

00:47:02
measure things

00:47:04
and there's actually quite a bit of

00:47:06
Divergence over time but also across

00:47:10
countries as to how a city is actually

00:47:15
measured

00:47:16
in some contexts

00:47:18
um

00:47:19
there's a city

00:47:21
um something counts as a city as of 1

00:47:24
000 inhabitants in other countries it

00:47:26
would be ten thousand and it would have

00:47:28
a tremendous impact on how we calculate

00:47:32
the urbanization

00:47:34
okay so this is more fundamentally uh

00:47:38
what they argue is that there's a huge

00:47:40
nationalist bias in how the urban is

00:47:43
defined I'm not saying that there's 200

00:47:45
definitions but for instance when you

00:47:48
look at at the work the work of

00:47:51
um

00:47:52
of organizations like the United Nations

00:47:54
they have been struggling to set a

00:47:57
standard definition of what the urban is

00:48:01
there's still quite a bit of diversity

00:48:03
and when you look at the work of urban

00:48:05
geographers for the past 50 or 60 years

00:48:07
this is a kind of a recurring issue

00:48:10
right so what they say is that yes there

00:48:13
are real empirical caps in our knowledge

00:48:16
here of of of the rate of urbanization

00:48:21
uh and therefore it's almost meaningless

00:48:23
to say as in some day in 2005 we became

00:48:28
more urban are we by now our Urban

00:48:30
species so it's kind of yes there's a

00:48:33
broad trajectory uh toward urbanization

00:48:37
but there's a very large bandwidth that

00:48:41
that we should consider and in fact it

00:48:45
could be more interesting to look at

00:48:46
different kind of urbanization

00:48:48
trajectories because it's it's dealing

00:48:51
with all kinds of different processes

00:48:52
that need to be studied as historically

00:48:55
unfolding rologists then being captured

00:48:59
in a figure of 75 for this so it's more

00:49:03
of an invitation to start looking at

00:49:05
things so this also connects to the

00:49:07
second argument

00:49:09
is that the urban as it is being

00:49:12
measured by a process of urbanization is

00:49:16
somewhat of a chaotic abstraction it

00:49:19
means that

00:49:21
um

00:49:22
different kind of things that are not

00:49:24
necessarily related are packed together

00:49:27
to define a certain process

00:49:30
and and this is something that for

00:49:32
instance a new Brenner and Chris

00:49:34
Christian Smith have also worked on

00:49:36
later as they discussed the notion of

00:49:38
planetary urbanization I invite you to

00:49:40
look into that debate their argument is

00:49:44
that the urban in fact as a condition as

00:49:47
a way of life or as a system of

00:49:49
production or exploitation does not

00:49:51
neatly overlay actual morphologies of

00:49:55
cities

00:49:56
so the urban uh may have nothing to do

00:50:00
with a concentrated uh blob of people in

00:50:05
space or with sitting within a

00:50:07
particular jurisdiction it could be

00:50:09
connected to suburbs etc etc so and what

00:50:13
they kind of are concerned with is when

00:50:16
you talk about rates of urbanization is

00:50:19
that you classify or categorize quite

00:50:22
diverse uh ways of of living into one

00:50:26
category of the urban uh and an even

00:50:29
more problematic so hence we don't

00:50:32
really learn anything about it and what

00:50:35
is even more problematic is that the

00:50:37
rule is defined as the non-urban

00:50:40
and is thereby

00:50:42
yeah not studied at all as kind of a

00:50:45
left behind place that only exists in

00:50:48
opposition to what really counts which

00:50:50
is then the way forward which is urban

00:50:52
living so that's kind of their arguments

00:50:55
just to kick start a little bit you're

00:50:58
thinking uh on this

00:51:01
since we now have uh I would say 60

00:51:04
seconds for a one minute paper Okay so

00:51:07
please think a little bit you can talk

00:51:09
to your neighbor

00:51:11
um in any direction about what the urban

00:51:15
is what a city is and what the

00:51:18
differences between the two right

00:51:37
thank you

00:51:44
[Music]

00:52:00
[Music]

00:52:06
[Music]

00:52:24
thank you

00:52:31
very much

00:52:38
[Music]

00:52:46
those were 120 seconds

00:52:49
right here

00:53:04
okay

00:53:13
[Applause]

00:53:15
for almost three minutes for the one

00:53:17
week paper

00:53:20
please

00:53:21
what is a city what's the urban and

00:53:24
what's the difference

00:53:38
okay

00:53:42
so what's the difference then what do

00:53:45
you say

00:53:46
why is the urban a place

00:53:49
oh maybe not

00:53:51
because there are quite density of many

00:53:53
layers and cities

00:53:58
okay and why do you think it's the

00:54:00
reverse I think elements of the oven can

00:54:03
exist everywhere I don't think elements

00:54:05
of the city exist everyone so the city

00:54:08
defined as a dense place is kind of

00:54:10
identifiable in space whereas the urban

00:54:13
could yeah connect to everywhere

00:54:16
potentially okay

00:54:19
other ideas

00:54:32
or inequality or like in an infield

00:54:35
environment this is something you can

00:54:37
touch

00:54:41
so one is about you could say concrete

00:54:44
lumps of material yeah

00:54:52
about Urban societies yeah

00:54:55
other ideas yeah

00:55:03
yeah I think that connects a little bit

00:55:06
to what what we say processes and then

00:55:09
maybe outcomes products of urbanization

00:55:11
okay now other ideas

00:55:33
Etc

00:55:34
and that wouldn't be captured by the

00:55:36
notion of a city

00:55:39
if not cities can be

00:55:42
places of extreme exclusivity okay

00:55:46
um of dedicated to a very specific class

00:55:49
so a lot not all cities have

00:55:52
same the Notions of having public

00:55:55
transport that is Affordable for

00:55:57
everyone but I would say that if you're

00:55:59
talking about the urban you're already

00:56:01
thinking of it in terms of how do we

00:56:04
organize this mass group of people okay

00:56:06
and how do we get order into

00:56:10
um

00:56:10
so it's about the club projects

00:56:13
particular values perhaps behind

00:56:15
policies to organize cities we are

00:56:18
building on the process idea that was

00:56:20
mentioned earlier

00:56:21
okay

00:56:22
any other ideas still

00:56:26
yeah I think maybe for a city I think of

00:56:29
it having

00:56:31
focus of like

00:56:34
being people and maybe that also nothing

00:56:38
on to sort of like a governance

00:56:40
structure versus for urban I maybe think

00:56:42
more about

00:56:44
what is the like level of density and

00:56:48
the living situation and people okay

00:56:51
okay or like a descriptor versus like a

00:56:56
um

00:56:57
thing that everybody is like linked to

00:57:01
or participating in yeah yeah yeah okay

00:57:03
yeah there was a hand still behind

00:57:05
somewhere yeah at the back

00:57:08
um

00:57:12
[Music]

00:57:20
[Music]

00:57:25
yeah so it's an administrative unit

00:57:28
which elected officials Etc that

00:57:32
accounts within the boundaries of a

00:57:34
certain space and not beyond that

00:57:36
perhaps

00:57:37
all right so inductively you make my

00:57:41
made my next slide's completely

00:57:43
redundant uh so yeah one of the ideas

00:57:46
and importantly to say I mean with

00:57:49
Brandon Schmidt it's kind of a

00:57:51
sensitivity that the urban and cities

00:57:54
are not necessarily the same

00:57:56
I think

00:57:57
the point is not to say or to Define

00:57:59
clearly what

00:58:01
a city is or the urban is but you offer

00:58:04
different kind of perspectives

00:58:07
um different kind of lenses

00:58:09
on on the question and by offering

00:58:13
different kind of perspectives

00:58:15
are emerging from different kind of

00:58:17
questions we may actually learn more

00:58:19
about the process of urbanization so it

00:58:22
is not kind of one ruling explanation

00:58:25
but there's many ways of looking at it

00:58:27
okay

00:58:29
um but I think yeah we'll get to

00:58:31
something more so one idea is that it's

00:58:35
about

00:58:36
a concentration of people it's also also

00:58:39
about the concentration of stuff

00:58:41
lump of material the built environment

00:58:44
yeah so it's something with density

00:58:46
something also a lot of I think

00:58:48
urbanists would recognize so it's the

00:58:50
built environment built up space that

00:58:53
clearly gives morphological uh signs

00:58:56
that at some point we have arrived in

00:58:59
the city be it high rises

00:59:02
a lot of of congestion uh that would be

00:59:06
markers of characteristics of so that's

00:59:10
kind of not necessarily Urban but it's a

00:59:13
kind of a marker of what is a city

00:59:17
then fetching a little bit more into

00:59:20
you could say the overlays between what

00:59:22
is urban

00:59:23
and how it's the borders cities

00:59:29
um cities are sometimes defined as uh

00:59:32
the opposite of the non-city as I was

00:59:34
saying uh as the opposite of the rural

00:59:37
and then a number of planning contexts

00:59:39
I'm thinking about for instance the

00:59:42
Netherlands it will actually be if you

00:59:44
look at the satellite image it will be

00:59:46
identifiable where one urban area ends

00:59:50
then there's Countryside and then

00:59:52
something else starts

00:59:54
but

00:59:55
yeah in many contexts especially in the

00:59:59
Flemish one for instance this is a

01:00:01
reality where you won't get really far

01:00:03
it's kind of you're not sure where the

01:00:06
where the city ends you you end up with

01:00:08
some kind of um

01:00:10
large boulevards that connect to yeah

01:00:14
villages in in the middle of nowhere

01:00:16
there's a lot of built up uh stuff along

01:00:20
these uh schustees Etc

01:00:23
um and there's a lot of activities

01:00:25
actually taking place outside of the

01:00:27
core areas of urban agglomerations

01:00:30
there's suburbs uh there's actually an

01:00:33
intensification of activities in suburbs

01:00:36
um

01:00:37
so yeah

01:00:39
um what does it still mean to talk about

01:00:41
the city as being opposed to the

01:00:44
non-city the rural it generates all

01:00:47
kinds of fuzzy categories so purely

01:00:49
morphologically you may end up

01:00:53
um being in trouble now okay yes

01:00:58
[Music]

01:01:02
that's for me

01:01:04
the city is something that is

01:01:07
that's perpetually becoming something

01:01:09
um

01:01:12
energy where we can experiment with our

01:01:16
identities and

01:01:18
yeah yeah I agree uh we haven't covered

01:01:22
this yet so maybe we're we're talking

01:01:24
about about this so it's

01:01:27
yeah the urban or a city uh is the place

01:01:31
of an urban life but perhaps the urban

01:01:34
also selections Beyond uh the city

01:01:37
itself so Urban living could also be

01:01:40
taking place in the suburbs but it's

01:01:42
some kind of an idea that within

01:01:45
um

01:01:46
Within These spaces uh a different kind

01:01:49
of society and a different kind of

01:01:51
behavior uh Norms values can take place

01:01:56
um so it's a distinctive way of life but

01:01:58
still it could be

01:02:01
um a very different kind of energy that

01:02:04
we may be talking about or a different

01:02:05
kind of bones that actually uh ties

01:02:08
people together

01:02:10
so just compare slum living with Loft

01:02:13
living it's a very distinct way of urban

01:02:18
living but they've been Mo both be

01:02:21
characterized as something else than

01:02:22
ruralism okay so

01:02:25
um and there's this big debate I would

01:02:27
say in urban sociology between what is

01:02:30
now distinct about the urban way of life

01:02:34
as some kind of an assumption that you

01:02:36
move from Community uh to society and

01:02:39
communities think about rural

01:02:41
communities where you have all kinds of

01:02:43
uh personal relations with neighbors

01:02:46
it's a small villages and this gets

01:02:50
formalized anonymized as soon as you get

01:02:53
to cities because distances become

01:02:56
larger because there's all kinds of

01:02:59
institutional roles there's a division

01:03:01
of labor that we'll get to in a second

01:03:03
and it becomes more abstract you take a

01:03:07
certain function within society which is

01:03:09
less mediated my social relations that

01:03:12
was kind of the argument uh by a lot of

01:03:14
sociologists also in the 19th century

01:03:17
that tried to capture the process of

01:03:19
urbanization so it's a distinctive way

01:03:21
of life it's not just buildings and

01:03:23
humps and of material it's it's it's

01:03:27
more than that

01:03:29
another way of looking at it and with

01:03:31
internet uh by you here at front it's

01:03:33
also about economic relations that tie

01:03:36
together people um think about flows of

01:03:40
energy flows of of work flows of ideas

01:03:43
uh flows of data

01:03:46
um that's uh that connects the

01:03:49
inhabitants of a certain place and it

01:03:51
would be more uh agglomerated in some

01:03:54
places than others but they wouldn't be

01:03:57
necessarily confined to you could say

01:04:00
the core of metropolitan areas

01:04:02
so the city is also the place where

01:04:04
divisions of labor emerge and there's

01:04:07
this famous picture by Adam Smith's

01:04:09
needle Factory or pin Factory uh where

01:04:14
uh cities are kind of a microcosm of an

01:04:17
uh a workshop where different kind of

01:04:20
tasks that used to be integrated in uh

01:04:23
in pin making are kind of cut up and

01:04:27
collectively places uh produce a certain

01:04:30
economic product okay so there's inputs

01:04:33
needed by different kind of suppliers

01:04:35
different kind of specialized workers do

01:04:39
end up with a product okay so

01:04:43
historically that has been a way where

01:04:46
Urban Elites could emerge that could

01:04:49
also kind of manage this process that

01:04:52
could also absorb part of the Surplus

01:04:55
that was being generated by a more

01:04:58
efficient uh efficient division of labor

01:05:01
standardization of work for instance and

01:05:03
it was also you could say in a more

01:05:05
critical framework the place where

01:05:07
uneven development and urban

01:05:10
inequalities actually have their Origins

01:05:12
okay so it produced more efficiency it

01:05:15
increased the urban Surplus if you will

01:05:17
but not everybody benefited so a complex

01:05:21
division of labor the idea that there

01:05:24
are a collaboration Effects by being in

01:05:28
a certain place

01:05:29
economic agents for instance will

01:05:31
benefit from from their presence because

01:05:34
they have specialized inputs Etc that's

01:05:36
kind of the realm of urban economics

01:05:38
Urban economic geographies that try to

01:05:41
capture that process

01:05:44
enough is obviously when you talk about

01:05:45
uh divisions of labor about these

01:05:48
energies that go around these also

01:05:51
structure

01:05:52
um Urban spaces and you could say Urban

01:05:55
class relations in a particular way

01:05:58
so

01:05:59
you could apply some kind of a

01:06:01
regulationist perspective here thinking

01:06:04
about

01:06:06
um

01:06:06
we could say different eras of uh of of

01:06:10
cities

01:06:11
as being engaged in particular

01:06:14
production processes pre-capitalist

01:06:17
cities for instance at the top left then

01:06:20
the typical newly industrializing cities

01:06:23
uh top right then going bottom left to

01:06:27
for the cities and then you could say

01:06:30
contemporary cities that are kind of

01:06:32
both exploded and imploded at the same

01:06:35
time with Rising densities at the edges

01:06:38
and also a re-intensification of build

01:06:41
up areas in the in the very core and the

01:06:43
return of activities there so a regular

01:06:45
a regular regulations perspective is

01:06:48
also kind of what Dory Massey will be

01:06:50
talking about she was a famous economic

01:06:53
geographers economic geographer from

01:06:56
1980s and she was also one of the main

01:06:58
critical voices and trying to understand

01:07:01
how particular forms of capitalism leave

01:07:05
their imprint on society in general and

01:07:08
on Urban Societies in particular she was

01:07:10
interested in regions but it also can be

01:07:13
applied

01:07:14
um to cities so yeah you had a really uh

01:07:18
a very hierarchical Society in general I

01:07:21
mean there's a huge generalization here

01:07:23
in medieval cities where the core was an

01:07:26
elite realm uh with some domestic

01:07:28
servants then there was a kind of a

01:07:30
layer of the lower classes and then

01:07:32
basically the outcasts with the number

01:07:34
of ethnic communities this I mean

01:07:36
there's a huge generalization but it's

01:07:38
kind of a guiding model uh that is it's

01:07:42
it's set to hold when you think about

01:07:44
industrializing cities it was kind of

01:07:47
thing and this is uh Chicago for sure

01:07:50
and we'll be talking with Nick more

01:07:52
about Chicago as it became a model of of

01:07:55
the industrial city in the early 20th

01:07:58
century uh a lot of industrial activity

01:08:00
in the commercial

01:08:03
um Heart of the City and then radiating

01:08:06
out uh in terms of you could say classes

01:08:10
working men's houses and then further on

01:08:12
more Elite cities people neighborhoods

01:08:16
people that could actually afford to

01:08:18
commute to the city center

01:08:21
then after the second world war if you

01:08:24
look at the bottom left it's a kind of

01:08:26
the poorest city where capitalism was

01:08:28
regulated in a particular way where the

01:08:31
Surplus that was being created by

01:08:34
capitalist production think about all

01:08:36
these factories mass production was

01:08:39
being shared by the working class so

01:08:41
this is kind of the typical American

01:08:43
dream it typifies American cities but it

01:08:46
depends also to provide European cities

01:08:48
where we had a massive round of

01:08:50
suburbanization uh the good life where

01:08:54
you could live far removed from

01:08:57
um from where you worked

01:08:58
compute by car and it was a way to kind

01:09:02
of spatially redistribute the surface

01:09:05
that was being generated in cities okay

01:09:07
that's a kind of a Harvard David

01:09:09
harveying interpretation of

01:09:12
suburbanization is not just a lifestyle

01:09:14
it's also a spatial form of how

01:09:17
capitalism uh of in that period worked

01:09:21
okay

01:09:22
and then kind of finally

01:09:24
um this kind of growth at the periphery

01:09:27
we see a kind of an outward movement you

01:09:30
can say the urbanization of Suburbia all

01:09:33
kinds of knowledge identity activities

01:09:35
that are starting to take place at the

01:09:38
edges a lot of City centers that are

01:09:42
losing functions this kind of historical

01:09:45
process in the 70s and 80s a lot of

01:09:47
derelict areas Brownfield areas which

01:09:50
are then in the subsequent decades

01:09:52
increasingly becoming the places where

01:09:54
you have waves of gentrification a

01:09:57
return of capital uh to City centers etc

01:10:00
etc

01:10:03
all this and I'm trying to hugely

01:10:05
summarize and generalize here because

01:10:07
it's a kind of Ideal typical approach

01:10:12
um diversity that is increasing in a lot

01:10:15
of cities new pockets of exclusiveness

01:10:18
and exclusion on the other hand so

01:10:21
cities also becoming increasingly

01:10:23
polarized Etc so the urban is is

01:10:28
different depending on the period you're

01:10:31
talking about it could be characterized

01:10:33
differently depending on where you are

01:10:36
and in what period you're talking about

01:10:43
[Music]

01:10:45
bottom left and right

01:10:48
yeah you could say that I mean

01:10:50
um in some handbooks it would be called

01:10:53
the Ford City this one and this would be

01:10:56
the post for this city which is kind of

01:10:59
exopolis there's not one and

01:11:02
identifiable Horror in the metropolitan

01:11:05
area

01:11:07
um whereas this was still very much in

01:11:10
relation before but it captures the

01:11:12
difference you could call it modernity

01:11:15
um yes but that's more referred to you

01:11:18
could say a discussion of planning

01:11:21
approaches uh modernist planning for

01:11:25
instance where it was okay we're going

01:11:27
to organize the city in zones here is

01:11:30
residential function here we have

01:11:32
industrial function but but you're right

01:11:35
in that sense especially in the Forest

01:11:37
City it was uh at the larger scale

01:11:41
managed like that and it was also where

01:11:43
a lot of urbanists come to reaction uh

01:11:47
was launched against uh later on

01:11:51
um

01:11:52
think about the figure of Jane Jacobs

01:11:54
who basically said well with Mother's

01:11:57
Fleming this hand there's a top-down

01:11:59
approach doesn't have anything to do

01:12:01
with with urban life in us and of its

01:12:04
own so we have to take stock of that to

01:12:06
start thinking about a different way of

01:12:07
planning so

01:12:09
modernism would be a marker I would say

01:12:11
of uh again yeah of urban Society but

01:12:14
also about planning Traditions uh that

01:12:16
have produced before this city

01:12:20
and then another way and this wasn't

01:12:23
really mentioned is yeah the urban or

01:12:27
the city is also kind of a projector of

01:12:29
symbolic power

01:12:31
um

01:12:32
it sends a message to the world and this

01:12:36
is becoming uh I mean goes back to the

01:12:40
20 the 12th and the 13th century where

01:12:42
uh the evil cities and Flanders had the

01:12:46
highest wanted to have the highest

01:12:49
building or some jiminiano in the 14th

01:12:52
century and Northern Italy

01:12:54
um

01:12:55
had something to do with corporate power

01:12:57
Merchant power but also showing the

01:13:00
Liberties of cities vis-a-vis uh

01:13:03
territorial states which were then still

01:13:06
feudal states in the Middle Ages

01:13:08
you see that this is becoming much more

01:13:10
globalized and that's the content of

01:13:13
these messages is also very diverse you

01:13:15
have the CCTV building in Beijing which

01:13:18
is some kind of a representation of if

01:13:21
it's authoritarian power of the Chinese

01:13:25
Central State over China but also extra

01:13:29
territorially as the World Trade Center

01:13:32
and

01:13:33
yeah we I don't think we need to

01:13:35
deconstruct that and I mean there's a

01:13:38
lot of images

01:13:40
um

01:13:40
I mean about acclaimed imperialism by

01:13:43
the US which was fasted in the

01:13:46
commercial uh interests or the

01:13:48
commercial power of the superpower of

01:13:50
the US

01:13:52
um which then also became uh a symbol of

01:13:56
uh of Oppression if you will and made it

01:13:58
a a target for uh for attacks

01:14:03
um as we all know so it's it's a highly

01:14:06
contested uh or arbitrary symbol there

01:14:11
and often it's also kind of used in

01:14:15
speculative

01:14:16
developments you could say uh Khalifa in

01:14:20
the Middle East and Dubai

01:14:23
um it's kind of part of a wider process

01:14:25
of say

01:14:27
ing Supply sites economics where it's

01:14:30
really about building capacity building

01:14:33
state-of-the-art infrastructure with the

01:14:36
idea that it will attract business and

01:14:38
others will in the end

01:14:40
drive drive growth to buy an Emirates

01:14:44
without oil or where oil has run out

01:14:47
through the 60s has had this

01:14:49
diversification strategy and it has been

01:14:52
to some extent a kind of self-fulfilling

01:14:55
prophecy uh so yeah it's kind of a token

01:14:59
of importance of centrality that is

01:15:01
being proclaimed there it also is a

01:15:04
token of other things a huge

01:15:07
exploitation of temporary labor for

01:15:09
instance but it is typically the Dark

01:15:12
Side of these kind of uh buildings that

01:15:14
is less uh discussed so it's part of

01:15:17
spectacular urbanism makes us wonder

01:15:19
what what is behind uh this image so

01:15:23
yeah symbolic power has also kind of

01:15:26
projected uh by certain kind of cities

01:15:31
um and then maybe a final definition is

01:15:34
indeed yeah the administrative

01:15:36
definition

01:15:38
um it has is a certain yeah

01:15:41
um jurisdiction within a country it's

01:15:44
the way where all kinds of management

01:15:46
processes are administered but the

01:15:48
population is serviced but how the

01:15:50
public sector organizes itself and what

01:15:53
is kind of interesting is that there's a

01:15:55
lot of kind of

01:15:56
um historical and accuracy

01:15:59
um yeah aberrations almost uh when you

01:16:03
take for instance the example of of

01:16:05
medicine uh in West Flanders I put an

01:16:08
arrow there for those who don't know uh

01:16:11
Belgium that well it has about 1 000

01:16:14
population in 2019 but it counts as a

01:16:17
city yeah so it's kind of a historical

01:16:19
artifact

01:16:22
um

01:16:22
it used to be a very important

01:16:25
um trading center for broadcloth if

01:16:28
you've ever been to Bruges that was was

01:16:30
kind of the main

01:16:32
um main kind of produce that was kind of

01:16:34
uh traded there Bridges was 40 000 k at

01:16:38
that time so a fifth of the size of

01:16:40
world City bridges in I think the 13th

01:16:43
century so what is a very small

01:16:46
community now was there there and then

01:16:48
an important city and somehow Mason has

01:16:51
kept its City rights and would still

01:16:54
count as a city in un uh in U.N language

01:16:58
okay so just to show that we should

01:17:01
probably be very wary about

01:17:04
about these classifications because they

01:17:07
can be uh quite misleading okay

01:17:17
for the number of people living there or

01:17:21
um that's a good question I didn't know

01:17:22
it by heart that it would be a

01:17:23
combination of of

01:17:26
of many things it would be indeed uh

01:17:28
size of the population I think

01:17:31
um yeah more more morphological

01:17:35
um character characteristics typically

01:17:37
it would be

01:17:39
um

01:17:39
continuous built up areas

01:17:42
uh

01:17:44
um and then included in that

01:17:47
some definition of a percentage of

01:17:50
people commuting to the poor City so

01:17:53
areas that are still dependent uh on the

01:17:56
core City because they're part of an

01:17:58
integrated labor market so I don't know

01:18:01
it by heart but there's kind of the the

01:18:03
agglomeration and then the bond here

01:18:05
which is gives a kind of an another

01:18:07
territory of that so and then

01:18:12
um that's basically what they call

01:18:13
functional urban areas that the kind of

01:18:16
definition that is that people would use

01:18:19
yeah and I think maybe there's also

01:18:22
something app to the part in becoming

01:18:24
school because I know what they're made

01:18:25
for example my appointment is my city it

01:18:28
never got similar rights okay so maybe

01:18:30
they just never requested anyways and

01:18:32
maybe they didn't did they did Wells

01:18:35
back in yeah

01:18:38
yeah I think that that could indeed I I

01:18:40
don't know the ins and outs of that but

01:18:42
I think indeed that could be a to be

01:18:44
part of the process as well yeah

01:18:47
[Music]

01:18:54
yeah they try to come up with some kind

01:18:56
of a standardization on the criteria

01:18:58
that I was mentioning so it's a yeah how

01:19:01
many people live there

01:19:03
morphological continuity and then you

01:19:05
could say economic relations

01:19:08
but especially when the um with the

01:19:10
population threshold there's a huge

01:19:12
fabrication some countries it would be 1

01:19:15
000 and others it would be ten thousands

01:19:22
um I think they do because Belgium does

01:19:25
so um so that's kind of the irony yeah

01:19:28
and that gets lost in when you look at

01:19:31
the urbanization rates of 200 plus

01:19:33
countries you can't look into that but

01:19:36
the point by by Brendan Schmidt is that

01:19:38
even if you solve that and come to a

01:19:40
standardized definition you're still not

01:19:43
out of the woods because it's it could

01:19:45
still

01:19:46
create all kinds of chaotic uh

01:19:49
conceptions because the urban is not the

01:19:51
same as the city okay so that was kind

01:19:54
of uh was the point okay so I hope yeah

01:19:57
there's a number of perspectives here

01:20:00
um

01:20:01
there's not one size fits all answer to

01:20:05
what the urban and the city is but

01:20:07
there's different ways of of approaching

01:20:09
the theme okay

01:20:13
now

01:20:15
um

01:20:16
one definition that we could still use

01:20:19
and there's also one that is used in the

01:20:21
handbook is kind of very generically at

01:20:24
the abstract level it's obviously

01:20:26
urbanization is the process of becoming

01:20:28
Urban

01:20:30
and it refers at the abstract level to

01:20:32
demographic process where increasingly

01:20:34
people

01:20:35
live in that and more more and more

01:20:38
density

01:20:39
it has something to do with the

01:20:40
globalization of uh

01:20:43
uh of urban uh influence be it economic

01:20:47
political cultural yeah it's kind of

01:20:50
these places that matter

01:20:51
and obviously this this Frame of the

01:20:54
urban age is mobilized there

01:20:58
and it's a call for

01:21:00
starting to look into how cities are

01:21:03
connected to the wider process of Urban

01:21:06
Development

01:21:07
and this is also connecting back to this

01:21:10
notion of planetary urbanization

01:21:13
by Brenner and Schmidt in a sense what

01:21:16
they argue is that while cities may not

01:21:20
populate the entire Earth they're

01:21:23
actually

01:21:24
quite delineated still if you produce a

01:21:27
map

01:21:28
you can't say that the entire uh global

01:21:31
map is urban uh maybe a lot of people

01:21:34
live in cities but still it wouldn't be

01:21:36
a totality

01:21:38
whereas the urban as a process as a way

01:21:43
of living as a system of capitalist

01:21:45
production would be almost a totality

01:21:49
and in planetary urbanization captures

01:21:52
actually the fact that even when you go

01:21:55
as far as as possible from the urban

01:21:57
context from cities

01:22:00
it would still lead back to these cities

01:22:03
one way or another so the exploitation

01:22:05
of seabeds in the North Atlantic it's

01:22:09
absolutely absolutely not uh has not the

01:22:12
characteristics of cities but it's

01:22:15
part of a uh of exploitation processes

01:22:19
that are commanded through uh through

01:22:22
cities so it's a an example of what they

01:22:24
call extensive urbanization whereas

01:22:28
intensive urbanization in their mind

01:22:30
would be the morphology of cities so

01:22:33
it's a kind of sociological imaginary of

01:22:36
urbanization As It All Leads back to

01:22:39
cities one way or another whereas a more

01:22:42
geographical imagination would start

01:22:45
with well we can still remunerate

01:22:47
certain places as being more dense as

01:22:50
being more urban than one another

01:22:52
whereas we also have to see the

01:22:54
connections with other things so

01:22:56
that's just one more approach of looking

01:22:59
at it

01:23:01
we've been talking a little bit about

01:23:02
urbanism because it's always a bit of

01:23:04
confusion difference between

01:23:06
urbanization which we've been talking

01:23:07
about and urbanism

01:23:10
um you have urbanists here it's it's not

01:23:13
just about observing and analyzing

01:23:15
breasts is also

01:23:17
um designing cities and shaping cities

01:23:21
in a particular way so urbanism is

01:23:25
is uh Dimitri uh uh as the craft of

01:23:31
actually designing cities to a certain

01:23:33
end but it also connects to uh and

01:23:36
that's perhaps also what you were

01:23:38
talking about at some point gaining an

01:23:40
urban attitude there's something of an

01:23:42
energy of that particular society and

01:23:44
cities refers to a particular

01:23:47
psychological or sociological feeling uh

01:23:51
that gives a particular meaning to a

01:23:53
space and I already talked about the

01:23:55
opposition between the ideal type of a

01:23:58
community where this kind of warm social

01:24:02
ties kicking things together versus a

01:24:04
society where it's more abstract formal

01:24:07
roles that are impersonal uh I think

01:24:10
when you look at cities and the

01:24:12
representations and the way the urban

01:24:15
space is consumed you find a lot of that

01:24:18
uh you could say societal

01:24:22
um anonymity uh or that kind of detached

01:24:25
element in those images and

01:24:29
when you look at yeah especially in the

01:24:31
19th century

01:24:33
I mean when people start to capture

01:24:35
process of modernity of urban modernity

01:24:38
and with this idea of the figure of the

01:24:40
fla nerve which was at the same time it

01:24:43
was usually a he a Dandy a rich person

01:24:46
that was both connected to cities

01:24:49
because of his wealth and he had to show

01:24:51
himself off but at the same time he was

01:24:52
also a spectator a walker by Passion who

01:24:57
consumed Urban space from in a very

01:24:59
Anonymous and detached way and

01:25:01
especially in the 19th century I mean we

01:25:04
have this Gallery here close to the

01:25:05
ground Plus

01:25:06
in Brussels it was a kind of urban space

01:25:10
was designed for this Anonymous

01:25:12
consumption was was all about Collective

01:25:15
spectacular consumption and in many ways

01:25:18
Urban Design

01:25:20
especially when we start to Rebrand our

01:25:23
city centers

01:25:24
goes back to these forms of of urban

01:25:27
consumption if you think about these

01:25:30
renderings of uh on Spock Boulevard or

01:25:34
if you look at renderings of how uh

01:25:37
Philippine campus will look like in 10

01:25:39
years it has this kind of spectacular

01:25:41
element always to it that's that

01:25:44
protects a particular kind of urban

01:25:47
attitude that is there to consume Urban

01:25:50
space to work

01:25:53
so Urban Design it's about

01:25:56
um

01:25:57
they're really giving shape to Urban

01:26:00
spaces but also capturing how people

01:26:03
interact with psychologically and

01:26:06
sociologically with the built

01:26:07
environment especially within urbanism

01:26:11
for for instance environmental

01:26:13
psychology and that is a a very

01:26:15
important team

01:26:19
planning is

01:26:23
a future oriented activity in which acts

01:26:25
as various types engaged so that they

01:26:27
can govern how development will take

01:26:29
place so

01:26:31
um obviously

01:26:33
economic process societal process don't

01:26:36
just unfold in and of themselves it's a

01:26:38
kind of uh process of being mediated by

01:26:41
a particular planning cultures I mean we

01:26:44
talked about zoning before it's about

01:26:46
giving a place to certain activities

01:26:49
making choices of where things should be

01:26:53
developed and it's actually quite a

01:26:55
power Laden process because development

01:26:57
in one place could mean non-development

01:27:00
in another place where do jobs where are

01:27:03
jobs being creative where do they not

01:27:06
and how do certain planning procedures

01:27:08
start to to tackle uh process of uneven

01:27:12
development or under development within

01:27:14
the city and especially in a city like

01:27:16
Brussels

01:27:18
one of the main you could say folki off

01:27:21
of urban planning

01:27:23
um in the regional plan has been the

01:27:26
Canal Zone it was kind of a prioritary

01:27:29
space which needed to be redeveloped in

01:27:33
one way it's a well we'll be looking

01:27:36
into the social geography of this place

01:27:38
uh and and throughout the course but

01:27:41
also as we go on excursions it's an

01:27:43
ethnically diverse typically lower

01:27:46
income neighborhood with a lot of

01:27:47
unemployment and it's also very much a

01:27:51
zone of transitions a lot of things

01:27:53
happening there Redevelopment and

01:27:55
planning is not neutral there

01:27:58
um there has been a large focus on this

01:27:59
area both in terms of trying to achieve

01:28:03
industrial Redevelopment because there

01:28:06
was a lot of unemployment kind of a

01:28:09
rollout of a zone of economic expansion

01:28:12
that was installed there

01:28:14
at the same time also the ambition to

01:28:17
achieve mixity to increase the mixing of

01:28:22
residential and and

01:28:24
um and and workings okay

01:28:28
and what is kind of interesting there in

01:28:30
in Brussels is that there was a very big

01:28:33
contradiction between the ambition to

01:28:36
attract uh businesses to this area and

01:28:39
create jobs and the ambition of mixer

01:28:41
team because mix City worked as a kind

01:28:44
of an incentive for all of residential

01:28:46
developers to start building

01:28:50
um yeah high-end or

01:28:53
I would say regionally unaffordable uh

01:28:57
Apartments house etc etc so

01:29:00
the idea of let's mix stuff is actually

01:29:04
making

01:29:06
um The Return of jobs to this area

01:29:09
very difficult it leads to forms of

01:29:11
industrial gentrification

01:29:14
and it's also leading to some kind of an

01:29:17
affordability crisis because the types

01:29:20
of houses that are being produced there

01:29:21
has nothing to do with what the local

01:29:24
residents would actually need okay so

01:29:27
that's housing production but it's not

01:29:30
tailored to the demand if you will

01:29:33
so yes uh planning plays a role

01:29:37
um and it's all but a neutral process

01:29:43
now what is geography

01:29:47
you have one minute to discuss this and

01:29:49
geographers I'm looking at you to

01:29:51
explain what geography is

01:29:54
because I can't

01:29:56
please discuss what is geography

01:30:05
foreign

01:30:18
[Music]

01:30:40
[Music]

01:30:49
[Music]

01:30:56
yes

01:31:03
you have an idea already

01:31:06
it's not as I have to explain not the

01:31:08
parts or branch of geology

01:31:11
and receptions that's typically what I'm

01:31:13
meeting up okay but um what's your idea

01:31:16
about this

01:31:18
mm-hmm

01:31:29
and they were

01:31:30
maybe total topology or

01:31:35
the terrains like that or the nearby

01:31:38
services

01:31:40
so

01:31:41
where a particular location is

01:31:44
okay so it's about location it's about

01:31:46
the impact of you could say the terrain

01:31:49
on activities and those kind of things

01:31:51
oh yeah okay thank you

01:31:57
um

01:32:03
particular like areas on sale

01:32:09
like

01:32:11
geology for example okay

01:32:16
geography is the study of space I mean I

01:32:19
can be applied to anything so it doesn't

01:32:21
matter what you're studying if you want

01:32:23
to be looking at a scale then that's

01:32:26
okay

01:32:28
that gives us tremendous power as

01:32:31
geographers thank you for that

01:32:34
thank you for that any other ideas yeah

01:32:48
so dialectics between humans and the

01:32:52
environment okay

01:32:54
other ideas yeah

01:32:57
foreign

01:33:05
[Music]

01:33:29
like to say for example sometimes it to

01:33:32
faculty

01:33:34
you think so special approach

01:33:38
that's very interesting yeah and your

01:33:41
idea is still

01:33:43
okay I think I think there's all I would

01:33:47
say correct in a way but it shows that

01:33:50
there's different different answers to

01:33:51
this question and the answer to this

01:33:54
question has been different throughout

01:33:56
the history of geography uh I would say

01:33:59
in the 19th century it was indeed about

01:34:01
creating detailed information on

01:34:04
resources topography and those kind of

01:34:06
things because geography was installed

01:34:09
in an imperial program of exploiting the

01:34:12
colonies but throughout the decades uh

01:34:17
the main purpose or less on depth of

01:34:19
geography has shifted

01:34:21
or there's different kind of parallel

01:34:24
interpretations of what the purpose of

01:34:26
geography should be

01:34:28
I start with a number of

01:34:30
definitions where else do we go the real

01:34:33
Royal geographical Society this is this

01:34:36
kind of the heart of Empire if you will

01:34:40
um one of the first geographical

01:34:41
Societies in the kind of part of the

01:34:44
British Empire as it's a kind of ruled

01:34:48
disease and it gives us some idea of

01:34:51
what geography could be so it's

01:34:54
the understanding of Social and physical

01:34:56
processes within the context plays

01:34:58
recognizing the great differences in

01:35:00
cultures political systems economies

01:35:01
Landscapes and environments across the

01:35:03
world and exploring things between them

01:35:04
so it's about the the world as a mosaic

01:35:08
it's about geographical difference

01:35:10
sensitivity to contexts

01:35:13
and also thinking relationally so how

01:35:17
does something that happens in Brussels

01:35:20
connects to Kinshasa for instance so

01:35:23
it's about connections between places

01:35:25
but these are not I mean I'm not saying

01:35:27
these are ideal definitions

01:35:30
by far not but we can be inspired and

01:35:33
fix certain things from

01:35:35
American Association of geographers used

01:35:38
to be the association of American

01:35:39
geographers by the way but they changed

01:35:42
their name to reflect more diverse

01:35:44
audience uh in the community

01:35:48
you want to understand the world's final

01:35:50
start with the River City a mountain a

01:35:52
village a road and follow it to the ends

01:35:54
of the Earth geography asked the big

01:35:56
questions where how why what if as you

01:36:01
were saying and gives you the

01:36:02
perspective to answer them with advanced

01:36:04
technology and the solid knowledge of

01:36:06
the world in which we all live okay so

01:36:09
follow your nose Trace connections uh

01:36:12
and indeed ask these big questions where

01:36:15
perhaps in other disciplines

01:36:18
um there's less space to do so okay

01:36:22
by the way if you go to the original you

01:36:25
could say literal Greek transcription is

01:36:27
Earth description

01:36:30
um but that doesn't tell you that much

01:36:33
right it's a standard definition would

01:36:35
be to describe uh human activity at the

01:36:39
interface of uh and with with the Earth

01:36:43
or something like that so it somehow

01:36:46
goes back to a very descriptive idea of

01:36:48
what geography should be uh not

01:36:51
necessarily producing any analytical

01:36:54
knowledge or explanatory knowledge okay

01:36:57
so I tend to not to like that definition

01:37:00
too much but

01:37:02
in original Greek it's what it means

01:37:05
okay

01:37:06
now to further a little bit there and I

01:37:09
think I mean this going a little bit

01:37:11
more

01:37:12
um towards my own expectation as well

01:37:15
just another quote

01:37:17
uh take from the handbook While most

01:37:19
social science disciplines can be

01:37:21
roughly defined by what they study the

01:37:23
economy culture society and so on

01:37:25
geography is defined by how we stand so

01:37:27
that was what you were saying

01:37:29
and so the World by our approach

01:37:31
geographers study the economy Society

01:37:33
politics and culture too but a

01:37:35
geographical perspective is one that

01:37:37
emphasizes space it is approached to any

01:37:40
of these subjects so it's not just that

01:37:43
we can claim uh like political

01:37:46
scientists or like economists this kind

01:37:49
of thematic field it's really our you

01:37:52
could say theoretical and analytical

01:37:55
working with the notion of space space

01:37:58
as something that explains what human

01:38:02
activity as it interacts with its

01:38:06
environment that really

01:38:09
identifies so sets us apart as

01:38:12
geographers from us yeah just the

01:38:14
questions the how is this definition

01:38:15
that any difference from you know

01:38:18
sociology as a whole

01:38:21
but because there would be far less

01:38:23
attention to space

01:38:25
I would say

01:38:26
that's so childhood sociology isn't that

01:38:29
space it's also defined how human

01:38:31
interactions go

01:38:33
like that the whole point is

01:38:37
how space defines house I wouldn't think

01:38:40
so I think sociologists would would

01:38:43
start with particular yeah

01:38:46
um histories perhaps look at the

01:38:48
relations organizational forms uh

01:38:51
perhaps identity those kind of processes

01:38:54
but I think and they perhaps they may

01:38:57
describe variety

01:38:59
uh across different contexts in one way

01:39:02
or another but perhaps they would not

01:39:04
use geography to explain uh

01:39:08
those differences so for instance I mean

01:39:12
I mean what could I think of as an

01:39:14
example I mean when you when you try to

01:39:16
understand urban life

01:39:19
uh being sensitive to how you're

01:39:22
inserted uh in a Global Network of uh of

01:39:26
cities could be

01:39:29
um could be one way to appreciate your

01:39:31
own positionality so if you're a citizen

01:39:33
of a city like in Shasta which is an

01:39:36
exploitative or subordinate relation to

01:39:38
other cities in the world it may give

01:39:41
you a hint of why your living conditions

01:39:43
are that bad whereas sociologists May

01:39:47
perhaps start explaining that from local

01:39:50
cultures uh local societal

01:39:52
characteristics political systems Etc a

01:39:55
geographer would for instance try to put

01:39:58
that in perspective and say look there's

01:40:00
an overarching system

01:40:02
a world system of sorts maybe we can

01:40:05
talk about this next week that allows to

01:40:08
explain uh that a little bit better

01:40:14
okay I don't but I think yeah and that

01:40:18
connects a little bit to the to the next

01:40:20
uh thing and the sociological

01:40:22
imagination and these are the words uh I

01:40:26
mean this is what what David Harvey

01:40:28
writes and social justice in the city

01:40:30
it enables the possessor to understand

01:40:32
the larger historical scene in terms of

01:40:34
its meaning for inner life and external

01:40:36
career a variety of individuals so the

01:40:39
sociological imagination enables us to

01:40:41
grasp history history and biography and

01:40:43
the relation between the two in society

01:40:45
so it's about think about issues like

01:40:47
class and how knowledge is produced uh

01:40:50
what kind of questions that you ask that

01:40:53
are predefined for not predefined by

01:40:56
shaped by our by your own class identity

01:40:59
for instance or epic identity to

01:41:01
acknowledge that would be one thing but

01:41:03
Harvey says the spatial imagination

01:41:05
enables the individual to recognize the

01:41:07
role of space and place in some

01:41:09
biography so like for instance somebody

01:41:12
from South Africa who starts teaching

01:41:15
in in London

01:41:18
in

01:41:20
as a geographer

01:41:22
how with this personal trajectory uh

01:41:25
lead to some kind of a focus on issues

01:41:28
of what is modernity what is

01:41:30
non-modernity what is development what

01:41:33
is under development and those kind of

01:41:34
things so how for instance on a career

01:41:37
as a scholar from the global South going

01:41:40
to the global North might shape the

01:41:42
questions that are being asked

01:41:44
next to just issues of class ethnicity

01:41:46
and other elements that may shape

01:41:49
positionality

01:41:50
I could use the example of Jennifer

01:41:52
Robinson for instance who fits this

01:41:54
exercise and she came up with the idea

01:41:56
of ordinary cities somehow debunking the

01:42:00
whole idea that would be extraordinary

01:42:01
world cities and then the rest okay so

01:42:06
just saying that in your personal

01:42:08
biographies

01:42:09
your spatial trajectory and your spatial

01:42:12
relations with other places may also

01:42:15
have an impact on the kind of questions

01:42:17
uh that you're they're asking I'm not

01:42:20
saying that uh sociologists are blind

01:42:23
but they they just ask different kind of

01:42:25
questions

01:42:26
okay

01:42:27
now for me I mean these are difficult

01:42:30
theoretical discussions it's also not an

01:42:32
epistemological

01:42:33
epistemology class but I think it's safe

01:42:36
to say that as as human geographers

01:42:39
we're interested in uh the interactions

01:42:42
between space and Society how spaces

01:42:45
shape societies and individuals and vice

01:42:48
versa how individuals and societies

01:42:51
space shape their environments and this

01:42:54
is kind of what

01:42:55
at soja a famous uh American geographer

01:43:00
calls an association dialectic

01:43:03
um and it's and then you translate that

01:43:05
to cities it's how Urban societies make

01:43:09
the places they live in and at the same

01:43:12
time how Urban space morphologically or

01:43:15
otherwise has again back an influence on

01:43:18
urban life as as groups and individuals

01:43:21
think about segregation which shows a

01:43:24
segregated social structure

01:43:27
it's something social but it also will

01:43:29
Define the kind of interactions that you

01:43:31
have with others in urban space and they

01:43:34
have an impact on what kind of

01:43:35
encounters you have in the city may have

01:43:37
an impact on

01:43:39
how privileged you are

01:43:42
um to what extent you know other social

01:43:45
groups and Society Etc so space one

01:43:48
example that killing to the work of Nick

01:43:50
later on

01:43:51
that shows that space has in itself some

01:43:54
kind of an autonomous form of

01:43:57
uh explanation I'm very uh defensive as

01:44:01
a geographer as you can see because as

01:44:03
all geographers I have an identity

01:44:06
crisis

01:44:07
um but that's kind of a very productive

01:44:09
one I would say because this kind of

01:44:11
typifies the history of post-war history

01:44:14
of geography and maybe other geographers

01:44:16
will will recognize that

01:44:19
um yeah so the social spatial dialectic

01:44:21
perhaps this is as a synthesis what we

01:44:24
can land on how society's people make

01:44:27
spaces and how it works back to them and

01:44:29
thinking about

01:44:30
the autonomous power of space and

01:44:34
explaining stuff

01:44:35
as an example if I can can I

01:44:40
yes

01:44:42
four ways and I mean you mentioned it

01:44:44
already it's thinking about different

01:44:46
concepts of space territory scale

01:44:49
networks plays are for common ways of

01:44:51
thinking about space

01:44:53
and they point to different kind of

01:44:56
spatial processes and again it's not

01:44:59
that one is better than the other to

01:45:02
understand what is happening but as I

01:45:04
will try to show by the example Brussels

01:45:08
kind of seeking tension between these

01:45:10
different concepts that get us gets us a

01:45:13
little bit closer to understanding for

01:45:15
instance in this case the conundrum that

01:45:18
Brussels supposed so one way of looking

01:45:21
at the city of Brussels is a territorial

01:45:25
one it has a particular jurisdiction

01:45:27
it's the Brussels Capital Region which

01:45:29
emerged as a region somewhere in the

01:45:31
1990s next to Flanders and malonia

01:45:35
and it has certain competences it has a

01:45:38
government a parliament we can do stuff

01:45:40
besides stuff on its territory

01:45:43
but not on culture because that's uh

01:45:46
something that is being decided by

01:45:48
flowers and the francophone Community

01:45:51
but other than that there's kind of

01:45:54
sovereignty uh on that level uh as what

01:45:57
can be designed so it's a very strict

01:45:59
kind of banded space if you walk 10

01:46:02
meters outside those boundaries in

01:46:05
principle uh the Brussels government

01:46:07
can't say anything about you

01:46:10
um and on the other hand it's also can

01:46:13
erect all kinds of barriers if Flanders

01:46:15
wants to add another Lane to the Ring

01:46:18
Road across Brussels because it is very

01:46:21
centered on on car Mobility

01:46:23
well there's ways of blocking that

01:46:25
because

01:46:27
um there's certain stretches of the Ring

01:46:29
Road where Brussels can say no let's not

01:46:31
do that here and in the end you end up

01:46:33
still with the bottlenecks okay so this

01:46:36
is territorial power to some extent uh

01:46:38
which has also been used uh by the

01:46:41
Brussels government saying everything

01:46:43
is 50 kilometers an hour max When you

01:46:47
entered the depart territory uh so yeah

01:46:51
um take it or leave it

01:46:54
so with territorial view of what

01:46:55
Brussels could be a second one it would

01:46:58
be a more scalar View

01:47:00
and scale

01:47:05
to

01:47:07
different processes work on different

01:47:09
scales some of them are really micro

01:47:11
teaching is a micro process taking place

01:47:14
in the at the scale here of the

01:47:17
classroom

01:47:19
whereas you could say commuting is

01:47:21
something that takes place at a far

01:47:24
larger scale as we go home it's a

01:47:26
process That's radically goes beyond the

01:47:29
boundaries of of this class okay it's

01:47:32
the same when you look at economic

01:47:33
activities

01:47:35
um as you if you look at the

01:47:37
Metropolitan Area morphologically

01:47:39
Brussels is actually much larger than

01:47:43
the Brussels Capital Region so if we

01:47:46
were to Define Brussels as a scale of

01:47:49
where Urban activities take place

01:47:52
you could end up halfway to Flanders or

01:47:56
halfway to Bologna okay so it radically

01:47:58
deep borders

01:48:00
um the territory that is the Brussels

01:48:02
capital region

01:48:03
in contrast to other contexts

01:48:07
um there has not been a very uh

01:48:09
successful process of we could say City

01:48:12
regionalization where there was some

01:48:15
kind of

01:48:17
governance expansion to manage the

01:48:20
Metropolitan uh process and a lot of

01:48:22
context we see that new governance

01:48:24
structures have been erected think about

01:48:26
London for instance

01:48:28
uh it hugely exceeds uh the original

01:48:32
Heartland of London but includes more

01:48:34
and more of its peripheries because

01:48:36
these places are connected to

01:48:39
um to the urban area okay this is not

01:48:41
what happened in Brussels and this has

01:48:43
something to do with the fact that

01:48:46
there's a very communitarian uh

01:48:49
sensitive issue okay because it deals

01:48:51
with all kinds of issues of

01:48:53
redistribution of uh of income Etc we

01:48:57
have to keep in mind that about 60 of

01:48:59
Belgian GDP is generated in Brussels uh

01:49:03
but it's not being governed into in its

01:49:06
totality by the Brussels government

01:49:08
in fact and that brings us to the third

01:49:10
one it's a network perspective

01:49:13
there's all kinds of micro networks in

01:49:16
this case this is the commuting map of

01:49:18
Belgium that makes that the Surplus that

01:49:20
is being generated by all these

01:49:22
activities and Brussels I think about

01:49:24
headquarter functions European functions

01:49:27
that apparently account for a quarter of

01:49:29
the Brussels economy it actually leaks

01:49:32
to the periphery so it leaks beyond the

01:49:35
borders of this territory of the

01:49:37
Brussels Capital Region a lot of people

01:49:39
including myself work in Brussels but

01:49:45
um basically pay taxes outside of

01:49:49
Brussels so I live in against this

01:49:52
beautiful other city

01:49:54
in Belgium and I yeah I get texts and

01:49:58
Flanders uh I spent a lot of money well

01:50:01
not so much because I work too much I

01:50:04
could spend a lot of money in Ghent

01:50:07
um but it basically is some kind of

01:50:09
physical leakage from uh from territory

01:50:12
right

01:50:13
and uh this is a problem with Brussels

01:50:17
we also could talk about uh eurocrats

01:50:19
who are not taxed at all but work in

01:50:23
Brussels so we can wonder about the

01:50:25
multiplier economic multiplier that's

01:50:27
being created by all these activities in

01:50:29
Brussels and that means that yeah

01:50:31
there's a lot of a large visiting class

01:50:33
about 400 000 commuters come to Brussels

01:50:36
every uh every day well pre-corona let's

01:50:40
see if it's still the case

01:50:41
uh but they use a city they spend uh

01:50:45
time on on the infrastructure but not

01:50:47
necessarily paying for that

01:50:50
and now it's very details of other kinds

01:50:52
of ways of arranging that as solidarity

01:50:55
than between the regions of flounders

01:50:57
for instance space

01:50:59
um a number of buildings every year to

01:51:01
Brussels as a sign of solidarity where

01:51:04
you can also frame it as just paying the

01:51:07
bill for being on the Metro in Brussels

01:51:09
using it every day and so this kind of a

01:51:12
discussion there

01:51:14
and it also is framed in very

01:51:17
identitarian communitarian terms

01:51:22
and this is kind of when you use a

01:51:24
concept like place

01:51:26
um

01:51:27
gets you a bit closer to this process of

01:51:29
how people attach meanings to some place

01:51:31
so Brussels and how it's represented in

01:51:34
Belgian Media or Flemish media I invite

01:51:36
you to uh buy a Flemish newspaper and

01:51:41
run it through Google to see how

01:51:43
Brussels is being represented as a

01:51:45
particular frame

01:51:47
um which has been augmented uh or

01:51:50
centralized even further as we had the

01:51:54
terrorist attacks in 2016

01:51:57
um where even Mr former president Trump

01:52:01
describe to normal and big as a hellhole

01:52:03
and was very nicely taken over by

01:52:06
Flemish media because it kind of

01:52:08
resonates with the idea of yeah

01:52:11
unsafe

01:52:12
image of Brussels

01:52:16
um

01:52:17
dirty image of Brussels

01:52:20
um

01:52:20
and yeah so it kind of resonates there

01:52:23
and what you see is especially is that

01:52:26
yeah this is also you could say

01:52:28
reenacted in the in the entire covet

01:52:30
crisis where again it's the same frame

01:52:33
of yeah Brussels can't manage look at

01:52:36
vaccination rates it doesn't get its

01:52:38
population under control they're messing

01:52:40
up again if we were independent and

01:52:43
flounders

01:52:44
yeah that we could be have all kinds of

01:52:47
other covet regulations etc etc would be

01:52:50
free already so it's kind of this Frame

01:52:53
of attaching certain meanings uh to

01:52:56
certain places so if you just go to

01:52:58
lidocack or you could also like they'll

01:53:02
be it's a big sign but flaming and

01:53:05
Thursday so it's

01:53:07
it's

01:53:09
yeah I would say somewhere here

01:53:13
so it's really dependent on um

01:53:16
on Brussels in terms of commuting but

01:53:19
what you see is that with the kind of

01:53:22
um return

01:53:23
of higher end residential functions the

01:53:26
city uh to the city of Brussels that is

01:53:29
actually a lot of displacement going on

01:53:31
and a lot of people that used to live in

01:53:34
what they call the residual housing

01:53:36
market still affordable housing in

01:53:37
Brussels it's actually being pushed out

01:53:40
and is increasingly

01:53:42
commuting to Brussels from further and

01:53:45
further away so in a sense you could say

01:53:48
um Brussels is spilling over all the way

01:53:51
to leader character and what you see is

01:53:53
that there is a very strong opposition

01:53:55
by uh identitarian parties a local mayor

01:53:59
which has really tried to

01:54:01
form a kind of a Bridgehead if you will

01:54:04
towards all that is foreign

01:54:13
uh to this process of urbanization there

01:54:16
and we can think about it uh what what

01:54:19
we want but it's certainly something

01:54:20
that is that is explaining a lot of the

01:54:23
tensions between Brussels and it's it's

01:54:26
growing Hinterland

01:54:28
so four takes of the Brussels to four

01:54:32
different kind of spatial

01:54:34
uh approaches and I think combining them

01:54:38
tells us a bit more about what on Earth

01:54:41
Brussels as a city is

01:54:45
um okay

01:54:47
um

01:54:49
is there still time do you still have

01:54:51
time for one minute of thinking about

01:54:53
what being critical means

01:54:55
I think in eight minutes we can stop so

01:54:58
one minute

01:54:59
of thinking of what is critical not in a

01:55:03
sense your condition is critical but

01:55:05
what is critical Urban studies or

01:55:07
critical urban geography for you what

01:55:10
does that mean

01:55:15
um

01:55:25
the countryside

01:55:49
[Music]

01:56:03
being critical

01:56:05
what does that mean

01:56:09
the ideas

01:56:21
are the absolute on the students

01:56:25
yeah so yeah questioning what you hear

01:56:28
what you see okay okay

01:56:33
making sure

01:56:34
all right

01:56:36
people who are the person yeah

01:56:42
so it connects a bit to what you were

01:56:44
saying uh fact-checking certain

01:56:47
statements

01:56:49
uh see where your ideas come from yeah

01:56:52
just being aware of your own biases like

01:56:55
confirmation bias sharing thinking about

01:56:58
something it's a huge help with being

01:57:00
critical as well cherry picking what is

01:57:02
that can you explain that traffic is the

01:57:06
selective picking of your sources

01:57:10
uh while you have Ida and you only code

01:57:14
source that also save others that also

01:57:17
represent the idea it's regarding all

01:57:18
the other end yeah so you go back from

01:57:21
the results to uh to the data selection

01:57:23
yeah yeah so being reflexive about your

01:57:26
own ideas yes exactly

01:57:34
required

01:57:38
mm-hmm

01:57:39
in the words

01:57:42
caring caring

01:57:44
uh and and okay and and caring how how

01:57:48
exactly that's an interesting term

01:57:52
s

01:57:53
and then

01:57:55
it will be like analyzing extracting and

01:57:58
like practice

01:57:59
and and what should we care about

01:58:04
um

01:58:06
true that's yeah any particular process

01:58:10
yeah uh I think it implies being

01:58:13
politically having an approach that is

01:58:16
politically engaged and also maybe

01:58:20
building upon his answer

01:58:23
listening to different actors and

01:58:26
especially the marginalized and not the

01:58:28
the what do you call them

01:58:32
official sources of knowledge okay

01:58:36
interesting yeah

01:58:44
it can also be accepting that there is

01:58:47
no classes

01:58:49
but like everything in the context and

01:59:01
okay

01:59:03
yeah I have to hold myself not a good

01:59:06
discussion but it's an interesting point

01:59:08
I think it's about being critical about

01:59:10
what effect is personally I would say be

01:59:13
sensitive how to how effect is produced

01:59:16
to use blue laptop in the sense that if

01:59:20
you put men in white jackets it would

01:59:23
give certain people them more power to

01:59:25
actually produce a fact whereas other

01:59:28
voices marginal voices will not be in

01:59:30
that position yeah

01:59:32
um

01:59:33
like a field level it involves like

01:59:36
taking care of the implications of the

01:59:39
way you're conceptualizing things are in

01:59:41
terms of economic and social impacts of

01:59:44
that and then

01:59:45
re-evaluating the theory sort of

01:59:48
Frameworks that you're using based on

01:59:49
what you're finding on that yeah

01:59:51
interesting so it's again being

01:59:53
reflexive about your own positionality

01:59:55
trying to tease out to what extents uh

01:59:59
your positionality shapes the questions

02:00:00
you ask

02:00:02
um and then try to address that one way

02:00:05
or another it's not easy yeah

02:00:12
um

02:00:26
foreign

02:00:33
label process

02:00:35
where some voices sound louder than

02:00:39
others

02:00:40
it reproduces stuff like that it also

02:00:42
has geographical uh implications because

02:00:46
it's not just some people I mean it

02:00:48
overlays with spatial structures I think

02:00:51
about it Global diploma Global cells

02:00:54
okay thanks a lot I mean uh exactly I

02:00:57
mean I have not so much to add to that

02:01:00
you can take the definition of of Jonas

02:01:02
at all and I think it captures some of

02:01:05
the things that were being said uh think

02:01:08
about New Concepts that reveal something

02:01:10
that we didn't know yet it's kind of

02:01:13
obvious but still

02:01:15
um think about being politically engaged

02:01:18
yes something that matters uh one way or

02:01:22
another but be reflexive about the fact

02:01:25
that some things might really matter

02:01:27
being picked up but not necessarily be

02:01:29
uh you could say very Progressive I mean

02:01:32
in a fascist Society there's all kinds

02:01:35
of knowledge on segregation to be

02:01:38
produced that is very useful and it

02:01:39
could be extremely politically engaged

02:01:41
in that but not necessarily uh

02:01:45
thinking about you could say

02:01:46
marginalized forces there

02:01:49
third Point indeed taking seriously the

02:01:51
experiences lies practicing words of

02:01:53
ordinary Urban residents

02:01:56
or marginalized social groups to think

02:01:58
about really okay we have this hegemonic

02:02:01
representation

02:02:03
what would happen if we would ask

02:02:04
different people if we start in a

02:02:06
different positionality etc etc

02:02:08
obviously you have your positionality as

02:02:11
a researcher on yourself

02:02:14
and it may be sometimes very hard for

02:02:16
instance as a man to study feminist

02:02:19
perspectives it may also be not

02:02:22
recognized as being a rightful person to

02:02:26
studying these kind of aspects so I

02:02:29
think it's a it's it's a kind of a a

02:02:31
negotiation process there and then again

02:02:34
or think about

02:02:36
um women that that focus on

02:02:39
the eliteness of investment banking in

02:02:43
the city think about work of Linda

02:02:45
McDowell for instance and how how it's a

02:02:49
difficult process for women to actually

02:02:51
enter these spaces have access but once

02:02:54
they get access they ask very different

02:02:56
questions and they'll actually lead to

02:02:58
quite uh revolutionary insights

02:03:02
an alternative formulation and that's

02:03:04
why I was a little bit hesitant with uh

02:03:06
there are no facts I don't agree I think

02:03:09
there are

02:03:11
um effects facts in a sense that there

02:03:14
are factual realities and a new series

02:03:18
kind of um kind of Middle Ground between

02:03:21
you could say

02:03:22
um truth as being something that's being

02:03:24
constructed

02:03:26
but you always have to construct it on

02:03:28
the basis of some kind of empirical

02:03:30
factual reality uh so not a radical

02:03:35
deconstruction or post-structuralist

02:03:37
thinking uh there's always a way of

02:03:40
saying this is I don't know the entire

02:03:42
truth but this is probably a little bit

02:03:45
more true than something else

02:03:47
and yeah you can write the citation uh

02:03:50
read the citation sorry

02:03:52
what he says is that the ultimate goal

02:03:55
is to reduce uh

02:03:57
illusion in society in and of itself so

02:04:01
if you have shark

02:04:03
periodical analytical categories and

02:04:06
Concepts you can work with that and you

02:04:08
will see things perhaps in a different

02:04:10
light and take away as

02:04:14
false beliefs and Illusions in society

02:04:16
and it also means that it's a kind of a

02:04:20
placeless and Timeless definition in the

02:04:22
sense that this could be the mission for

02:04:24
instance of critical Urban studies or

02:04:26
critical urban geography and what is

02:04:28
critical and what is a false belief and

02:04:31
what is an illusion may change over time

02:04:33
so it's kind of it keeps holding the

02:04:35
definition but it may have to be updated

02:04:38
in terms of how it works and exactly so

02:04:42
some rules of thumb

02:04:43
um

02:04:44
there's no universal theory of any

02:04:47
anything and I think we'll uh we'll show

02:04:50
that uh we have to be sensitive to the

02:04:54
fact that every theory has its

02:04:56
birthmarks

02:04:57
what were the questions uh that really

02:05:00
gave rise to formulating a research

02:05:03
question to a theory in a particular way

02:05:05
well we'll have to take a look at the

02:05:08
context about historically and spatially

02:05:10
uh to understand uh what that was so

02:05:14
think about The Chicago School that

02:05:16
you'll be talking about with Nick

02:05:19
it's it was assumed to be Universal

02:05:22
model there's actually a model of a city

02:05:24
that captures rapid urbanization in the

02:05:28
early 20th century in Northern America

02:05:31
and then the question to an extent that

02:05:33
actually explains something in different

02:05:34
locations in different times

02:05:36
we're not going to reject that but we

02:05:38
have to mobilize that concept and see

02:05:40
how far we get

02:05:41
so we have to be reflexive about these

02:05:43
bird marks so yeah even the concept of

02:05:46
class is something that is a western

02:05:49
Inception if you will

02:05:50
to what extent does it allow to actually

02:05:52
capture for instance Indian Society

02:05:55
so we need to kind of provincialize

02:05:58
theory and say okay it originated at

02:06:00
some point and now we can meaningfully

02:06:03
think about how we can speak across

02:06:05
context so think about

02:06:07
um

02:06:08
a global city has a concept that emerged

02:06:11
say mostly in in Northern America

02:06:13
Western Europe what extent does it allow

02:06:15
to capture what is going on in Singapore

02:06:17
for instance so to play uh while being

02:06:20
reflexive about these Concepts uh with

02:06:23
the application across

02:06:25
and engages pluralism that's kind of I

02:06:28
mean might be for engaged pluralism it

02:06:30
means that there are different kind of

02:06:31
theoretical stances different kind of

02:06:33
questions being asked entering from

02:06:35
different kind of teams and I think it's

02:06:37
not just about

02:06:40
acknowledging that but it's actually

02:06:42
engaging with this kind of descent

02:06:44
opinions and try to look for a

02:06:47
conversation and

02:06:49
maybe we can talk a little bit more

02:06:50
about that next week or in the next

02:06:52
sessions

02:06:53
as Urban Studies have grown and kind of

02:06:56
become ever more Global as the

02:06:58
urbanization has also globalized there's

02:07:01
always a risk that has some

02:07:04
um work that we become lost in in

02:07:06
comparison to use the words of Jamie

02:07:09
pack that we lose our points of

02:07:11
reference they actually be able to to

02:07:13
have some kind of coherent Urban studies

02:07:15
project or at least speak to one another

02:07:18
so I think there's a danger with a

02:07:21
Global Research agenda with so many

02:07:23
contextual differences how do we still

02:07:25
make sense of urban processes in

02:07:27
Singapore versus uh versus Brussels how

02:07:31
do you prepare

02:07:33
now I won't bore you now to death with

02:07:35
the next few slides too much but I just

02:07:37
want to say

02:07:39
um that what geography was and what kind

02:07:41
of critical questions were asked has

02:07:44
changed tremendously uh throughout time

02:07:47
much of geography originally was

02:07:50
really about human interaction with the

02:07:53
environment

02:07:55
um

02:07:56
say environmental determinism where it

02:07:59
was really believed yes it's really the

02:08:01
physical environment that will shape

02:08:03
human activities

02:08:05
Regional geography was also a very big

02:08:07
tradition especially before the second

02:08:09
world war where it was really about this

02:08:11
description of human activities in their

02:08:14
physical media there's still some

02:08:16
tradition there but what really happened

02:08:18
after the second world war boasts were

02:08:20
area especially since the 70s it was a

02:08:22
period of let's say great social and

02:08:25
political and economic upheaval is a

02:08:28
huge branching out of

02:08:31
um of geography so that's quite a

02:08:33
plurality of traditions there and they

02:08:37
take us quite far from the the origins

02:08:39
of geography was was really about

02:08:42
settlements if you will and then in the

02:08:45
pre-World War era was about okay show

02:08:49
East Anglia and where are the

02:08:51
settlements or describe me the structure

02:08:54
of a city after the second world war

02:08:57
especially in the 80s it was a kind of a

02:08:59
nomothetic move and the kind of we have

02:09:01
to formalize this and you have for

02:09:03
instance Boulder Crystal who came with a

02:09:07
quite a neat model to explain why at

02:09:10
certain locations you had certain

02:09:12
settlements of a certain size or for

02:09:15
instance he owns a much more such

02:09:18
formalizing the idea okay if there's

02:09:21
certain activities within a city at a

02:09:23
certain space it must have something to

02:09:25
do with the kind of value that is being

02:09:27
generated by those activities and the

02:09:30
fact that some activities outfit others

02:09:32
on a certain location so these are kind

02:09:34
of foundational approaches and I'm going

02:09:37
very fast here I know but it's just to

02:09:40
take note of that this led to a much

02:09:43
more plural uh discussion as of the 70s

02:09:48
and I I can't really do justice to all

02:09:50
these different Traditions here but what

02:09:53
you could say more radical and critical

02:09:55
voices uh share in one tradition you

02:09:58
could say yes questions of social

02:10:00
justice uh distribution they work in a

02:10:04
materialist setting so what people have

02:10:07
and how does class for instance income

02:10:10
Etc plus how does that explain divisions

02:10:13
in the city

02:10:16
nice names such as David Harvey uh Neil

02:10:19
Smith

02:10:20
those were kind of a period with a lot

02:10:23
of change we have social mobility of the

02:10:25
working class in 1970s

02:10:28
um feminist geographies uh that also

02:10:31
emerged at this point

02:10:33
um questioning male-dominated views

02:10:36
um on society

02:10:38
Etc so thinking about placing geography

02:10:41
relating it to process of of

02:10:45
um of capitalism

02:10:47
the other big strands you could say

02:10:51
um

02:10:51
there's more you could say a humanist

02:10:53
humanistic geography that thinks about

02:10:56
urban lifestyles Urban behaviors Urban

02:11:00
cultures which less kind of relates

02:11:04
itself to uh to capitalism uh in a sense

02:11:08
but really starts with okay what kind of

02:11:10
forces haven't we heard in the city how

02:11:14
are cities being experienced can we

02:11:16
think about the power of representation

02:11:18
how different spaces are being

02:11:20
represented what the power of discourses

02:11:22
is it's not just about material

02:11:24
circumstances also how we think about

02:11:26
certain places that will explain what

02:11:28
takes place

02:11:30
and also a shift towards more insane

02:11:32
qualitative methods

02:11:34
um that kind of simplifies the cultural

02:11:36
turn uh more widely okay

02:11:39
and this is not at the end of a

02:11:41
conversation I would say and that's kind

02:11:42
of the abundance of further studies

02:11:45
uh more widely and Robin particular that

02:11:48
all these different approaches exist

02:11:50
next to one another but you have to kind

02:11:52
of be aware that they work in different

02:11:55
kind of traditions and then we'll

02:11:57
formulate questions in a particular way

02:11:59
and I think you will see returning here

02:12:02
and there throughout the course somebody

02:12:04
who works perhaps a little bit more in

02:12:06
that framework or starts to refer to

02:12:08
that tradition and it's something to be

02:12:10
aware of I can't do justice to the

02:12:11
history of geography in three slides

02:12:14
that would be over the top but it's

02:12:17
something to think about

02:12:19
okay I'll end there sorry for taking a

02:12:21
little bit longer by next week please

02:12:24
try to get over these two texts

02:12:27
um or share it with your colleagues and

02:12:30
the world city hypothesis by John

02:12:32
Friedman and ALDI and uh somewhat less

02:12:36
old but still already investigated uh

02:12:39
text by saskia

02:12:45
mixed with muscles

02:12:49
all right

02:12:51
thank you very much

02:12:54
um and see you next week

02:12:59
[Music]



# 2 Theories of world-city formation

00:00:05
[Music]

00:00:12
thank you

00:00:22
welcome everybody good evening

00:00:25
welcome to the second session

00:00:29
off Urban

00:00:31
social geography

00:00:34
uh thanks for being here uh despite the

00:00:38
live stream and the recording

00:00:40
I think it really makes sense to be here

00:00:43
um

00:00:44
so we can have a bit of an interactive

00:00:46
session

00:00:48
um

00:00:49
how did you arrive in Brussels first

00:00:52
week

00:00:53
everything going okay yeah

00:00:57
yeah okay you're Landing still a little

00:01:01
bit

00:01:01
yeah

00:01:04
um how did you find the stuff so long

00:01:07
for for those attending

00:01:10
did somebody attacks it's not so long

00:01:13
yeah

00:01:15
they don't live up to your expectations

00:01:17
more or less

00:01:19
yeah

00:01:22
did you find it weird that I started

00:01:24
with uh over 50 of the urban population

00:01:28
lives in cities that this was on the

00:01:30
first slide okay yeah we didn't have a

00:01:34
deal that she would put that on there

00:01:36
but

00:01:37
I can see your critical Minds

00:01:40
deconstructing that first slide so that

00:01:42
um

00:01:43
yeah we have our answers here ready okay

00:01:47
uh today we'll be talking about you

00:01:50
could say an important chunk of of

00:01:52
research into urban uh urban geography

00:01:58
um most about geographers yes

00:02:03
they haven't no last week that

00:02:05
yeah it didn't work

00:02:07
um

00:02:09
yeah you remember yes okay as well no

00:02:12
the system doesn't work I'm not sure why

00:02:15
um but I have a singing voice so I'll

00:02:18
try to project my ideas

00:02:21
um and if you don't hear it I can do it

00:02:24
if it's higher or louder

00:02:27
um but maybe we should be a little bit

00:02:28
quieter than that will help as well so

00:02:32
world cities Global cities one of the

00:02:34
big debates I think in urban geography

00:02:36
in urban studies more widely

00:02:38
uh it's also a very long-standing debate

00:02:41
uh going back to at least the 80s which

00:02:44
probably also explains why you had to

00:02:46
read old stuff uh that you may or may

00:02:51
not find outdated uh I hope it's not

00:02:54
outdated they're all texts but I think

00:02:56
they're still relevant in one way or

00:02:58
another and we'll also try to discuss

00:03:00
that a little bit now what's the

00:03:02
structure of today there's three main uh

00:03:06
Parts uh this lecture

00:03:09
first of all we're going to discuss

00:03:12
I I mean very generally the centrality

00:03:14
of cities and city regions in the global

00:03:16
economy and will take you through three

00:03:18
uh complementary views or views that

00:03:20
built on one another by John Friedman

00:03:22
Sasuke assassin and Alan Scott

00:03:25
secondly uh so that's kind of a

00:03:27
conceptual theoretical discussion

00:03:29
secondly we'll have more of a

00:03:31
methodological discussion which deals

00:03:33
with how uh given these Concepts how we

00:03:37
can actually measure and say something

00:03:39
empirical about world cities and Global

00:03:42
cities

00:03:43
and one of the main methodologies there

00:03:45
is the methodology by gork which is the

00:03:48
globalization of world cities research

00:03:51
Network which was founded somewhere in

00:03:53
the 1990s by Peter Taylor and has been

00:03:56
one of the main you could say empirical

00:03:58
methodological uh contributions to the

00:04:01
debate from that period

00:04:04
and then third of all as we'll learn

00:04:07
um there was some kind of a dominance

00:04:12
if you will in this area of cities and

00:04:15
globalization

00:04:17
um and there as a dominant voice there

00:04:20
is also quite a bit of uh friendly and

00:04:24
unfriendly critique criticism uh toward

00:04:28
um this particular framing of of global

00:04:31
City and world city formation and I

00:04:33
think going into these debates is

00:04:36
actually quite telling

00:04:38
um as to how we Define uh world and

00:04:41
Global cities uh where we think that

00:04:44
that criticism is Justified where it's

00:04:46
Perhaps Perhaps less just a fight where

00:04:48
it deals with other kind of issues and

00:04:50
I'll be talking about four of those

00:04:52
points of criticism one you could call

00:04:55
the both Colonial critique a social

00:04:57
constructivist critique people that talk

00:05:00
about State rescaling and the role of

00:05:02
the state and then finally

00:05:05
um some Brilliant Minds that had

00:05:07
something to say about financialization

00:05:09
okay and that may alter a reading of

00:05:12
what actually happens in world and

00:05:14
Global cities

00:05:15
but before we start

00:05:18
my question to you uh why are cities

00:05:22
Central in the global economy and what

00:05:25
would it mean to say that cities are

00:05:28
actually powerful economically powerful

00:05:30
take a minute uh talk to your neighbor

00:05:34
uh right time a few notes and think

00:05:36
about what your answer could be go ahead

00:05:40
[Music]

00:05:52
foreign

00:05:57
[Music]

00:06:21
[Music]

00:06:32
yes

00:06:40
[Music]

00:07:11
thank you guys

00:07:21
okay first ideas are the most creative

00:07:24
ones

00:07:26
uh yeah

00:07:27
so how are cities Central in the global

00:07:30
economy and why oh how can we see that

00:07:32
they're powerful

00:07:36
is he the burning hand

00:07:53
become those centers of

00:07:56
um markets and of multinational

00:07:59
companies and that's why it gets more

00:08:02
and more power sometimes even more than

00:08:05
the nation states that are updated

00:08:07
because they become the part of this

00:08:09
International network of those

00:08:11
pharmaceutical cities

00:08:13
and on the other hand it's like most of

00:08:17
the innovativeness most of the capital

00:08:21
um like mostly not Material these days

00:08:24
but also like social capital is placed

00:08:27
in those big cities and that's why like

00:08:30
you you kind of have this uh point of

00:08:34
migration of high professional stores

00:08:39
okay thank you so it's something that

00:08:41
these are the seats of corporate power

00:08:43
and perhaps the elite that buzz around

00:08:46
those corporations okay other ideas

00:08:51
yeah the back

00:08:53
[Music]

00:09:05
[Music]

00:09:08
yeah

00:09:10
um

00:09:18
for example

00:09:21
yeah

00:09:26
okay so not just economic processes but

00:09:29
also the power of people and ideas

00:09:31
cultures diversity okay other ideas

00:09:37
yes I guess it helps out to that but we

00:09:40
we're talking about flows because this

00:09:42
is

00:09:42
true that all these flows come together

00:09:45
in large cities and then it becomes more

00:09:47
than it goes from this large city to

00:09:50
another large city and kind of

00:09:52
goes further than the national level

00:09:54
instead of going from the north city to

00:09:56
the the other parts of the country

00:09:58
because it moves between cities

00:10:01
and what is the the substance of these

00:10:04
flows it can be anything like for money

00:10:06
to knowledge to people

00:10:10
Commodities as well

00:10:12
okay other ideas yeah we were talking

00:10:15
about

00:10:16
um just like cities like city government

00:10:19
uh often have you know controlled daily

00:10:22
life budget and make cool side effects

00:10:26
you know a large number of people

00:10:28
quality

00:10:30
it's kind of the Benjamin Barber

00:10:32
argument what if Mayors ruled the world

00:10:34
there's a lot of in a lot of contexts

00:10:37
you could say the main economic centers

00:10:39
are also important political centers and

00:10:42
the national economy and National

00:10:43
politics and it seems to be also that

00:10:45
there's some kind of an extra

00:10:46
territorial supranational Authority

00:10:49
there as well okay thanks for your

00:10:51
answers I think there's other options to

00:10:54
talk about but

00:10:55
I think you already uh got to some of

00:10:57
the essential points what I'm going to

00:10:59
show you it's a bit of a a dated list of

00:11:02
figures but just to give a little bit of

00:11:04
of exhibits as to how important in

00:11:08
economic terms then and perhaps also

00:11:10
like the political terms

00:11:12
some world cities or world city regions

00:11:14
or Global city regions are this is a

00:11:17
list and this is research by a certain

00:11:21
man named lombrex from the early

00:11:24
Northeast and he compared the main you

00:11:27
could say leading metropolitan areas in

00:11:29
in Western Europe so it's by no means an

00:11:33
international comparison at a global

00:11:35
scale but it's comparing

00:11:38
um Delta Metropolis this is basically

00:11:40
Amsterdam rottenham the Hague Etc the

00:11:44
Flemish Diamond which is roughly

00:11:46
speaking against Antwerp Northern

00:11:49
uh Brussels uh which is kind of the

00:11:52
economic Heartland if you still remember

00:11:54
in Belgium

00:11:56
which is Western Germany kind of old

00:12:00
industrial area which is a a large

00:12:02
conversation with a lot of industrial uh

00:12:05
activity or at least it used to be

00:12:07
France this is basically greater Paris

00:12:09
and then greater London is greater

00:12:12
London okay so comparing these five

00:12:14
areas on a number of characteristics and

00:12:16
you'll also see the NX figures what he

00:12:18
kind of finds is that these region city

00:12:22
regions metropolitan areas are bunching

00:12:24
above their weight if you compare the

00:12:27
share in a national surface so the size

00:12:29
in terms of built-up structure depending

00:12:33
the complete territory

00:12:35
it's actually quite small

00:12:37
um when you compare that to figures in

00:12:40
population

00:12:42
these largely outweigh the share in

00:12:44
national territory and then when you

00:12:46
look at the share of these areas in GDP

00:12:50
which is kind of the value total value

00:12:53
of all economic transactions which is a

00:12:56
flawed measure in many ways but it's one

00:12:58
way of starting to compare National

00:13:01
economies we see that that these areas

00:13:05
actually punch above their weight so for

00:13:07
instance when you look at the Flemish

00:13:09
Diamond to take the Belgian example 30

00:13:11
of national service 52 of the population

00:13:14
lives there but 63 of all economic

00:13:17
activities uh actually take place there

00:13:21
um

00:13:21
more striking figures are even there for

00:13:23
uh for Paris and London only one and two

00:13:26
percent off uh of the territory uh about

00:13:30
we could say one-tenth to one one-fifth

00:13:33
of the population but in terms of

00:13:36
um of economic power especially for the

00:13:38
case of Paris it's it's way bigger than

00:13:41
you would anticipate okay so a large

00:13:44
um agglomeration and concentration of we

00:13:46
could say economic transactions that is

00:13:48
taking place

00:13:50
it also means that a lot of these places

00:13:53
tend to be richer

00:13:55
um than their Hinterlands okay so it's

00:13:58
kind of a runaway process it's something

00:14:00
with these activities that are taking

00:14:02
place there that generates more wealth

00:14:04
per capita so this is GDP per head so

00:14:07
you divide the value of economic

00:14:10
activities by the total population in uh

00:14:13
in that City so typically uh these

00:14:16
places are richer than

00:14:18
European average and also compared to

00:14:22
the rest of the economy in that sense

00:14:25
when you look at Brussels Brussels is

00:14:27
you could say the richest city uh in

00:14:30
Belgium

00:14:32
in principle richer than the rest of

00:14:35
Belgium but as as we discussed last week

00:14:38
there's a lot of this wealth actually

00:14:39
leaking to the periphery which is

00:14:41
actually in Flawless and bologna so it

00:14:44
doesn't really show when you look at at

00:14:46
figures from the Press of Capital Region

00:14:48
but the same would actually apply okay

00:14:52
um another way of looking at it is yeah

00:14:54
and this was kind of referred to by it's

00:14:56
a concentration also of ideas Innovation

00:14:58
people

00:15:00
um it's very difficult to measure that

00:15:02
one way of doing that is is looking at

00:15:05
patents right which is a kind of

00:15:07
certification legal certification that

00:15:10
something has been invented in one area

00:15:13
or another a coveted vaccine uh some

00:15:16
kind of a chip an algorithm whatever and

00:15:19
it has intellectual property on it so

00:15:21
and it can be commercialized in one way

00:15:23
or another but it's a very you could say

00:15:25
oh stock exposed kind of measurement of

00:15:28
of places and their their a measure of

00:15:32
innovation but it's a way to compare

00:15:34
different areas and what you see is that

00:15:36
uh here it's a bit more mixed

00:15:39
um if you for instance in in France you

00:15:43
see that uh that Paris is actually uh

00:15:46
outperforming the rest of of the country

00:15:48
this is far less the case in the UK but

00:15:52
it is the case in uh for instance the

00:15:54
Flemish dark okay so it's a bit more of

00:15:56
a but mixed picture but we see that in

00:16:00
general there's a tendency to locate you

00:16:02
could say Innovative processes as

00:16:04
evidence to battles okay there's a lot

00:16:07
of innovation that is not being measured

00:16:09
here no social Innovation for instance

00:16:12
it's really linked to Technologies uh

00:16:15
high-end services and these countries

00:16:17
okay

00:16:18
when you look at the the structure

00:16:21
of the labor markets uh you see that

00:16:24
typically metropolitan areas is also

00:16:28
show a higher share of Highly Educated

00:16:31
uh Highly Educated work okay so

00:16:35
substantially bigger

00:16:37
um say like

00:16:39
say in the Delta Metropolis it's 30

00:16:42
percent of uh Highly Educated people

00:16:45
compared to more or less 20 percent of

00:16:48
the rest of them in Netherlands and you

00:16:50
can have a look at the other cities to

00:16:53
see how it fares okay so a different

00:16:55
kind of Labor Market structure which

00:16:57
tells us something about the kinds of

00:16:59
activities that are probably taking

00:17:01
place there

00:17:02
uh and another indicator there is when

00:17:06
you look at the employment uh figures

00:17:09
across different kinds of sectors so

00:17:13
there's the in the three sector model

00:17:15
that's agriculture industry and services

00:17:18
and we see that well obviously uh

00:17:21
agriculture is very small but that's a

00:17:23
constant everywhere but that there's a

00:17:27
significant larger share in services in

00:17:31
these metropolitan areas than in the

00:17:34
rest of okay so it's there's these are

00:17:36
places that are not marked by industry

00:17:38
but by service economies

00:17:42
so these are just the number of exhibits

00:17:44
uh that tell you something about the

00:17:46
economic importance but it doesn't

00:17:48
really tell you why these places are

00:17:51
important it's just kind of a hint that

00:17:53
something is going on there and actually

00:17:55
you already mentioned quite a few ideas

00:17:59
of how we can theorize the centrality or

00:18:02
at least conceptualize the centrality

00:18:04
and Power in off cities in the global

00:18:07
economy one of the main text uh that is

00:18:11
in the reader for this week

00:18:14
was this world city hypothesis by by

00:18:16
John you've rolled Reddit

00:18:19
so you can just interrupt me if you want

00:18:22
to interject something

00:18:24
um but I just want to give you a number

00:18:25
of notes of my personal notes on on uh

00:18:29
what John Friedman was actually writing

00:18:31
about

00:18:32
so a bit of context to this uh to this

00:18:36
thesis or hypothesis it's a hypothesis

00:18:39
that

00:18:40
groups a number of observations from the

00:18:43
1980s tries to come up with a bit of a

00:18:46
research agenda that needs uh empirical

00:18:50
testing right but you need to understand

00:18:52
a bit more of this context of the 1980s

00:18:56
people of my age have to have the habit

00:18:58
of starting history in the 1980s because

00:19:01
it was the decade they were born if I

00:19:03
was 10 years older I was probably going

00:19:05
to refer the 1970s but as a toddler this

00:19:08
was my my context right so

00:19:12
um you have to remember that in the

00:19:13
1980s this was this emerging kind of

00:19:16
idea that we would experience the end of

00:19:19
the city right uh it was the rise of uh

00:19:23
information and communication technology

00:19:25
on a very Democratic large scale uh not

00:19:29
yet the internet but that was emerging

00:19:30
in the 1990s and being democratized

00:19:33
cheap mass transportation it became very

00:19:36
cheap to fly around the world

00:19:39
um shipping became something that was

00:19:42
very affordable

00:19:43
and what we kind of see is a complete

00:19:46
restructuring of the economy this kind

00:19:49
of reaching its high day in the 1980s it

00:19:53
was already going on in the 60s and 70s

00:19:56
but by the 1980s what became obvious is

00:19:59
that we we are in a new situation

00:20:02
which would call the new international

00:20:04
division of labor with new kinds of uh

00:20:07
geographies of production much more to

00:20:10
the the global east uh and far less

00:20:13
centered on the old industrial areas in

00:20:16
uh say European and America what we've

00:20:18
been discussing last week and we see uh

00:20:21
that this new centrality of cities need

00:20:24
theorizing if cities are not the places

00:20:27
where a lot of goods are produced and

00:20:30
hence where you get some kind of a trade

00:20:32
surplus when you start trading these

00:20:35
Commodities say textiles Etc with other

00:20:37
places in the world what is then the

00:20:39
kind of source of power that cities

00:20:41
actually hold okay

00:20:43
and what John Friedman comes up with is

00:20:45
say look to answer this question we have

00:20:47
to look at how cities are actually being

00:20:48
inserted and indeed an urban system that

00:20:52
is not only National but as Supra

00:20:54
National is actually a global Urban

00:20:56
system

00:20:57
you have to understand that in mostly in

00:20:58
the 1970s a lot of the tradition in

00:21:01
urban geography was looking at Urban

00:21:03
systems in a very nationalist way it was

00:21:06
methodological nationalism it was

00:21:09
looking at Argentina you have Buenos

00:21:10
Aires which was the Central City and

00:21:13
then you had a number of smaller towns

00:21:15
uh but there was a huge configuration

00:21:17
there uh and it left to some it left to

00:21:20
some blind spot as to what actually the

00:21:22
position of these cities were and

00:21:24
processes that went beyond National

00:21:26
economies and as these processes became

00:21:29
ever more prominent

00:21:31
it requested a huge uh you could say

00:21:34
conceptual Innovation uh that started to

00:21:37
emerge in the 1970s hence the importance

00:21:40
of Regents

00:21:42
um theorizing conceptualizing about

00:21:45
world city so a global Urban system

00:21:49
and the kind of main underlying

00:21:51
hypothesis sorry yes

00:21:56
so the last part what I was saying is

00:21:58
that you have processes of globalization

00:22:01
which means that the way that Urban

00:22:04
geographers were looking at Urban

00:22:06
systems became obsolete in one way or

00:22:09
another they were mostly linked to how

00:22:12
economies were functioning at the

00:22:15
national scale

00:22:16
uh looking into let's say where

00:22:19
productive activities were located how

00:22:21
commuter flows were organized how

00:22:23
Capital float etc etc

00:22:25
but as an increased share of the economy

00:22:27
became you could say International or

00:22:31
transnational

00:22:33
yes the first thing that needed to

00:22:34
happen was some kind of a conceptual

00:22:36
framework or apparatus that allowed to

00:22:38
understand centrality at a different

00:22:40
level

00:22:41
but differently instead of talking about

00:22:43
National Urban systems people started

00:22:45
talking about global Urban systems all

00:22:47
right

00:22:48
but looking at centralities okay so what

00:22:52
Freedom kind of uh started to to argue

00:22:55
also on the basis of his reading of

00:22:57
David Harvey in 1970s on Manuel castells

00:23:00
is that we can only understand what goes

00:23:02
on in cities if we relate that to the

00:23:04
position of these places in This Global

00:23:07
Urban system so it's the kind of their

00:23:09
function that they take in the global

00:23:11
economy or rather in This Global Urban

00:23:13
system that will help to explain what we

00:23:16
find in certain places

00:23:19
turned around on the other side of that

00:23:21
coin is that this Global Urban system or

00:23:24
this global economy can also be in part

00:23:26
explained through what is going on in

00:23:29
key Global cities or in this case world

00:23:31
cities to use the terminology so it's

00:23:34
the processes that emerge and are

00:23:36
steered and controlled from these places

00:23:38
that will have an impact on them larger

00:23:42
macro processes in the global economy

00:23:44
so that's kind of this dialectic global

00:23:47
system macro level Global Urban system

00:23:50
world cities and they're kind of

00:23:53
co-productive or co-constitutive right

00:23:57
so one of I mean one of the main

00:24:00
excerpts or key answer excerpts there

00:24:02
from this world city hypothesis which is

00:24:04
kind of very poignant is

00:24:06
um key cities throughout the world are

00:24:07
used by global Capital as basing points

00:24:10
in the spatial organization and

00:24:11
articulation of production and markets

00:24:13
the resulting linkages make it possible

00:24:15
to arrange a world world cities and into

00:24:17
a complex spatial hierarchy so it's

00:24:20
about appreciating how indeed capital

00:24:24
is and its actors

00:24:27
is kind of basing itself in cities as

00:24:31
they organize Global Production

00:24:33
and uh commercial activities okay so

00:24:37
that was kind of the main focus and if

00:24:39
we understand that we will start

00:24:42
explaining why certain places are

00:24:44
important and others less and why some

00:24:47
cities are dependent in this process and

00:24:50
why others are actually powerful

00:24:54
so yeah as I said it's a period of

00:24:56
geo-economic restructuring uh the loss

00:24:59
of a lot of functions uh that were

00:25:02
typically taking place in cities and I

00:25:04
mean John Friedman was was writing from

00:25:06
Los Angeles which was a very

00:25:09
production-centered uh town or city and

00:25:13
it was losing functions and what he

00:25:15
observed was still a huge concentration

00:25:18
of skyscrapers

00:25:20
and corporate headquarters but

00:25:24
production had long left

00:25:26
so this kind of conundrum was how do we

00:25:29
explain that how do we make sense

00:25:32
and indeed as I've been explaining you

00:25:35
had this emergence of the new

00:25:36
international division of labor

00:25:38
activities that were being offshored to

00:25:41
other parts of the globe and the

00:25:44
emergence of a new set of Enterprises

00:25:47
corporations multinational corporations

00:25:50
if you could say an American firm would

00:25:53
be globalizing or multinational

00:25:55
corporations where it was actually kind

00:25:58
of hard to still identify to what extent

00:26:00
they were still connected to some

00:26:01
territory yes

00:26:02
when you say that the production

00:26:05
activity has long left

00:26:07
what is the exactly these credential

00:26:10
activities I mean I this was the

00:26:12
question when I was reading the text

00:26:14
yeah I mean obviously it would depend on

00:26:17
the city that we're talking about uh but

00:26:20
think about uh what happened in cities

00:26:22
like Brussels I mean textile industry

00:26:26
um all kinds of of production facilities

00:26:29
for consumer goods that were initially

00:26:32
uh I mean think about washing machines

00:26:34
uh you know everything that you use in

00:26:37
the kitchen

00:26:39
um these were typically produced in the

00:26:41
post-war era in you could say the high

00:26:44
income industrialized countries

00:26:47
but because there was you could say

00:26:49
pressure on the profitability of these

00:26:52
activities because the wages were rather

00:26:54
High

00:26:55
these activities were offshore by

00:26:58
emotional multinational corporations and

00:27:03
one of the main motivations was the

00:27:05
search for for lower wages okay or you

00:27:09
could say less regulated labor markets

00:27:12
uh than than what was occurring in say

00:27:16
the traditional industrial areas yes

00:27:41
yes yeah I mean yeah indeed I mean and

00:27:45
this sometimes a little bit of confusion

00:27:47
there because people sometimes say okay

00:27:50
these industrial activities uh shifted

00:27:53
to the periphery so I think in the first

00:27:55
instance is the initial periphery of the

00:27:57
city I mean the whole year the suburbs

00:27:59
but I think even and it had something to

00:28:01
do with you could say more the urban

00:28:04
geographies the land Trends uh the

00:28:06
ground prices in cities because it's I

00:28:09
mean you need large surfaces and it's

00:28:11
easier to organize peripheries but then

00:28:14
at the later stage they would basically

00:28:16
uh I mean these activities were Cuts

00:28:19
because of investment in technology and

00:28:21
because you needed Less jobs

00:28:23
to make the same products and or there

00:28:27
were shifted to other places around the

00:28:30
globe okay so but this is kind of

00:28:32
I mean what what started to occur I mean

00:28:34
some people even in some Industries it

00:28:36
was already in the 1950s it's a kind of

00:28:38
this

00:28:40
and over a day

00:28:41
but it culminated if you will in the 70s

00:28:44
and then the early 80s which was a

00:28:46
period of crisis in a lot of cities

00:28:51
so yeah this new type of corporate actor

00:28:53
multinational corporations transnational

00:28:55
corporations uh and how they organize

00:28:58
Global production networks so a

00:29:01
production Network that used to be kind

00:29:03
of regionalized or nationalized in one

00:29:05
way or another

00:29:07
um relied on local suppliers ended up

00:29:09
being Global I mean if you have tried to

00:29:12
order a bike in the past one year you

00:29:15
know what it means to depend on Global

00:29:18
Supply chains or production networks

00:29:20
it's just

00:29:22
an intensely fine-tuned process if

00:29:25
anything goes wrong

00:29:27
I don't know a tanker blocking

00:29:29
um the Suez Canal or something

00:29:32
uh it's a precarious situation but

00:29:34
that's the kind of reality Global Supply

00:29:36
chains and it's a part of the economy

00:29:39
that's extremely dominated by these

00:29:40
multinational corporations just some

00:29:42
figures I mean there's a timeline there

00:29:45
1960s was about 66 billion what was kind

00:29:49
of uh foreign direct investment

00:29:51
sorry for the technical terms the terms

00:29:53
here but it means

00:29:55
um direct investment in setting up

00:29:58
um factories so you build a plant

00:30:00
somewhere else

00:30:01
so like uh Mercedes-Benz built a plant

00:30:05
in Korea or something I'm not sure if

00:30:07
they did

00:30:08
our Toyota builds a plant in in Texas

00:30:12
and it's kind of foreign direct

00:30:13
investment logic and it boomed basically

00:30:16
and you look at the figures of 2016

00:30:19
um I could update that I should probably

00:30:20
do that about a third of the global

00:30:23
economy is actually

00:30:25
um equivalent to these FDI figures yes

00:30:31
foreign direct investment

00:30:34
it's not too important but you just have

00:30:36
to understand that this is a measure of

00:30:39
transnational flows so it's a measure of

00:30:43
uh what part of the economy is

00:30:47
um not local but it's actually Global or

00:30:49
transnational

00:30:50
and it relates to uh the investment

00:30:53
activities by large corporations

00:30:57
to set up

00:30:59
Greenfield Investments out of this goal

00:31:01
so imagine a green field where you put a

00:31:04
new Factory or some such thing as

00:31:07
Brownfield Redevelopment which is an x x

00:31:11
site which is then a refurbish or one

00:31:14
way or another

00:31:15
okay so these are those kind of

00:31:17
activities so 90 of this global economy

00:31:21
uh of this FDI is concentrated in these

00:31:25
multinational corporations and slowly

00:31:27
getting to my point here this is also

00:31:29
why John Friedman was looking at

00:31:32
multinational corporations and their

00:31:34
geographies to identify and

00:31:37
conceptualize uh world cities so for

00:31:39
John Friedman Friedman it were the

00:31:42
cities where a lot of these headquarters

00:31:44
buy is an international corporations uh

00:31:47
we're located we're uh I mean those were

00:31:50
those cities that he identified as World

00:31:52
Series Okay so

00:31:54
since they're so important in the

00:31:56
globally okay

00:31:58
so as he says world cities are then uh

00:32:00
to be uh sites for command and control

00:32:03
and he really saw these corporate

00:32:06
headquarters as the places that controls

00:32:08
and command it in various ways either

00:32:11
through governance systems by decision

00:32:14
making by their internal structure uh

00:32:17
how Global Production was being

00:32:19
organized okay and it's kind of

00:32:22
methodological hypothesis was if we map

00:32:25
uh these headquarter geographies

00:32:29
we will actually be able to to map the

00:32:31
global Urban system and we'll also

00:32:34
understand the relation between

00:32:36
different kind of cities uh as to who

00:32:39
controls what and so it's a way to to

00:32:42
look at Power in This Global Urban

00:32:44
Network some places are more dominant

00:32:47
hold more command and control functions

00:32:49
than others okay so and then he came up

00:32:52
with this um

00:32:53
with this map or art program or whatever

00:32:55
you want to call it

00:32:57
um yeah it's certainly dated because

00:33:00
Soviet Union is still on there and it's

00:33:02
not gonna not part of this figure which

00:33:06
is also debatable maybe they were not uh

00:33:09
I mean you could say euro-american

00:33:12
corporate headquarters there but for

00:33:15
sure there were links uh even with

00:33:17
between the Soviet Union and capitalist

00:33:19
countries for sure but the whole point

00:33:22
is that what what Friedman actually does

00:33:24
here is Translate

00:33:27
uh the critical tradition of world

00:33:30
systems theory which is a way to explain

00:33:33
uneven development in the global economy

00:33:35
to an urban framework so identifies

00:33:38
three kind of areas globalization Arenas

00:33:41
if you will one centered on Asia one on

00:33:44
Northern America and one on Western

00:33:46
Europe and typically he kind of finds a

00:33:49
Power Balance where you you have

00:33:51
powerful cities with a lot of corporate

00:33:53
headquarters uh and you could say the

00:33:55
northern part of the hemisphere and more

00:33:58
you could say subordinate roles for

00:34:01
countries in the global South so when

00:34:04
you for instance look at Northern

00:34:05
America you have Los Angeles Chicago and

00:34:09
New York which are identified as core

00:34:11
cities with a lot of headquarters and

00:34:13
they're kind of

00:34:14
organizational networks threats to the

00:34:17
global periphery so there's connections

00:34:19
with Rio de Janeiro for instance Buenos

00:34:21
Aires and these are kind of

00:34:24
semi-peripheral cities who

00:34:27
also hold command and control functions

00:34:29
and headquarters that are oriented

00:34:32
towards these centers in the global

00:34:35
North could be that there are

00:34:37
subsidiaries of large corporations that

00:34:40
are organized their setup Etc so it's a

00:34:42
way to explain how power is distributed

00:34:44
in This Global Urban system and also

00:34:47
starts to explain why

00:34:49
perhaps some places benefit more from

00:34:52
this integration in the global Urban

00:34:54
system than others so it would probably

00:34:57
lead to an accumulation of wealth in

00:35:00
cities in the global North

00:35:02
to some extent also in the

00:35:04
semi-periphery think about Uria de

00:35:06
Janeiro but at the same time it would

00:35:07
also work as some kind of a funnel of uh

00:35:11
to siphon off a siphon actually of

00:35:14
surplus towards the global North

00:35:16
for instance uh a U.S corporation

00:35:19
producing stuff in Argentina

00:35:23
um in part there will be benefits

00:35:25
locally but at the same time there will

00:35:27
also be an extraction of surplus value

00:35:30
to the global North okay so it's also a

00:35:33
way to understand

00:35:35
unevenness in this global economy

00:35:38
I know it's a lot sometimes a lot of

00:35:41
economic terms but just to give you an

00:35:43
idea a restructured global economy and

00:35:46
the imaginary of a global Urban system

00:35:48
and cities taking a different role uh in

00:35:51
that on the basis of their command and

00:35:54
control functions which treatment

00:35:56
defines as headquarter functions

00:36:00
so that's world cities world cities

00:36:03
corporate headquarters command and

00:36:05
control I'm just giving you a number of

00:36:07
key Concepts there

00:36:10
a second way of theorizing it is and

00:36:13
that's why I also had the other texts I

00:36:15
could have given you the entire book the

00:36:18
global City but it would have taken you

00:36:20
uh a week probably or at least a few

00:36:23
days to actually read it you're still

00:36:25
invited to do so but it's a kind of a a

00:36:28
shorter uh kind of version of the

00:36:30
argument which kind of explains what

00:36:33
centrality is uh to Sasuke assassin okay

00:36:36
um but I'll give you a bit more context

00:36:38
by by referring also to her book the

00:36:41
global City so one of you could say what

00:36:44
is being argued to be one of the seminal

00:36:46
pieces talking about cities and

00:36:48
globalization it starts kind of from the

00:36:51
same route as Friedman I mean it had

00:36:54
been a very intense conversation in the

00:36:56
1980s about yeah what is going on with

00:36:59
cities they have shifting functions

00:37:01
they're faced with the industrialization

00:37:03
etc etc there's also a fiscal crisis of

00:37:06
the local state a lot of cities were in

00:37:09
trouble if you you saw the movie Taxi

00:37:12
Driver with the young Robert De Niro

00:37:14
he's uh he's driving around the Relic

00:37:18
New York in the city neighborhoods are

00:37:20
in trouble there's a lot of blight

00:37:23
um so cities were struggling to think

00:37:26
about what their functions could be and

00:37:28
what is going on especially in 1970s is

00:37:31
a complete restructuring of these Urban

00:37:34
economies so for assassin it's less only

00:37:37
about you could say new command and

00:37:39
Control Function about headquarters she

00:37:41
looks at the complete restructuring of

00:37:43
urban economies from you could say

00:37:45
manufacturing jobs to service economies

00:37:50
so we already saw that the majority of

00:37:53
economic activities in metropolitan

00:37:55
areas of our services but she

00:37:57
particularly focuses on on a particular

00:37:59
subset

00:38:01
of these Services which of course

00:38:03
Advanced producer services

00:38:06
so in the coming months you will

00:38:08
probably start to hate the notion of

00:38:10
advanced producer services or be

00:38:13
intrigued by it but it's a kind of I

00:38:16
mean you probably never heard about it

00:38:18
and neither did I before I ever read

00:38:20
about it but it tells it's it's kind of

00:38:24
um

00:38:24
trying to capture those very

00:38:27
sophisticated if you will Professional

00:38:29
Services that serve as inputs for other

00:38:32
firms so in in themselves they don't

00:38:35
really produce much

00:38:37
but still their input is very important

00:38:39
for other corporations

00:38:41
think about financial services

00:38:43
law management consultancy accounting

00:38:47
and auditing advertising etc etc so

00:38:51
these are not really producing things

00:38:54
that you can then buy and consume at

00:38:57
some point

00:38:58
this is actually very knowledge

00:39:00
intensive sometimes it's also called

00:39:02
knowledge intensive Business Services

00:39:04
which are kind of consumed as they are

00:39:07
produced so legal advice it's kind of

00:39:10
produced in in face-to-face meetings

00:39:13
think about a corporation that wants to

00:39:17
set up a shop or a plant or an

00:39:20
investment in China a European firm

00:39:23
probably you want to check a thing or

00:39:27
two with a large international law firm

00:39:31
that can give you a lot of experience as

00:39:35
to what the regulations are for I don't

00:39:37
know investment and ownership in China

00:39:41
um you would need

00:39:42
dedicated Financial Services how do you

00:39:45
finance uh your International expansion

00:39:49
you would need

00:39:52
um the advice of auditing firms

00:39:54
accounting firms because probably you

00:39:56
want to attract some further funding by

00:39:58
issuing I don't know stocks or bonds or

00:40:01
something like that so Financial

00:40:03
investors would want to look at at your

00:40:05
activities

00:40:07
[Music]

00:40:07
um

00:40:08
advertising yes how are you going to

00:40:10
sell your cookies cars Etc in China

00:40:15
um you need to know something about

00:40:16
about the local market or local markets

00:40:19
the sensitivities

00:40:21
um so yeah you may want to adapt your

00:40:24
practices there you may need the advice

00:40:26
of management Consultants because you

00:40:29
may say that you want to globalize but

00:40:31
how are you going to manage this process

00:40:33
what kind of responsibilities do you

00:40:35
give to your managers in China do they

00:40:37
have autonomy to take decisions

00:40:40
uh will you work with uh with the

00:40:43
central command structure how will you

00:40:45
think about the profit profitability of

00:40:47
your activities etc etc I mean it's not

00:40:50
a course in um in business studies here

00:40:53
but just imagine as a firm that you want

00:40:55
to globalize there's a lot of things

00:40:58
that enter into the picture and probably

00:41:00
uh these kinds of inputs that you need

00:41:04
are so specialized as it doesn't make

00:41:06
sense uh to start producing them

00:41:09
yourself okay so uh you just buy a very

00:41:13
very specialized inputs you get in touch

00:41:16
with lawyers Consultants Etc they would

00:41:18
fly in charge the hell out of you and

00:41:21
then

00:41:22
um run off and maybe their advice was

00:41:26
okay so a shift to the service economy

00:41:29
but with the globalization of production

00:41:32
and the globalization of markets and

00:41:34
financial markets we see that certain uh

00:41:37
service firms are becoming increasingly

00:41:38
important and these are these Advanced

00:41:40
producer Services Services

00:41:42
given to producing firms

00:41:45
um

00:41:46
and what she says is look instead of

00:41:48
looking at

00:41:50
um headquarters of Corporations we best

00:41:53
look not at the multinational

00:41:55
multinationals themselves but we we best

00:41:58
look at where these APS firms are

00:42:00
located

00:42:02
and it's not just that they have kind of

00:42:04
cold control over global Productions

00:42:07
networks as you could imagine corporate

00:42:10
headquarters where a CEO with a big

00:42:12
cigar takes a decision of uh flashing 10

00:42:17
000 jobs in in Belgium or something it's

00:42:20
a more dilute uh diluted form of control

00:42:25
which he talks about it's more about the

00:42:27
control capabilities it's uh the

00:42:31
assemblage or the you could say in the

00:42:34
entire mixture of these kind of service

00:42:36
economies that allows firms that use

00:42:39
these services to exert control of the

00:42:42
global scale so multinational

00:42:44
corporations Patel look at the long

00:42:46
story story short depends on yet another

00:42:49
set of players Advanced with user

00:42:51
services to actually be able to manage

00:42:53
Global Production

00:42:56
so that's kind of her reading not just

00:42:59
corporate headquarters but look at these

00:43:01
notes of advanced uh producers

00:43:05
and the second important element that

00:43:07
she links to that and we'll talk more

00:43:09
about that next week because it's a

00:43:11
slightly different topic is that this

00:43:14
these APS economies is high-end service

00:43:17
economies also is an important engine in

00:43:21
producing polarization

00:43:23
the other kind of process that produce

00:43:26
polarized uh cities but an important

00:43:30
driver according to sussland is

00:43:32
the higher remunerated salaries stuff in

00:43:36
these kind of

00:43:38
um

00:43:38
activities and this will have an effect

00:43:41
on the city so it produces an outcome

00:43:45
where you have high and low skilled

00:43:47
labor forces in APS or around APS and at

00:43:51
some point it could also even lead to

00:43:54
what she calls the peripheralization of

00:43:56
the core okay so there will be a drive

00:43:58
also to to boost informal labor markets

00:44:02
uh in parts of the local aircon okay but

00:44:07
we'll talk more about that uh next okay

00:44:11
so that's her idea about global cities

00:44:14
and in the end Global cities aside from

00:44:18
the production of specialized Services

00:44:19
needed by complex organizations for

00:44:22
running a spatially diverse dispersed

00:44:24
network of factories offices and service

00:44:26
outlets and the production of financial

00:44:28
Innovations and the making of markets

00:44:30
both Central to the internationalization

00:44:31
expansion of the financial industry so

00:44:34
for assassin it's both about and you're

00:44:37
free to refer to socials because it

00:44:39
rhymes with buttons as other students

00:44:41
have done so before and make movies

00:44:43
about

00:44:44
um so it's both about global production

00:44:46
networks but also the running of global

00:44:49
financial markets so it's not just the

00:44:52
production of goods themselves but also

00:44:54
connecting to the world of Finance to

00:44:56
get investments in these production

00:44:58
models okay so that's what Sasuke

00:45:00
assassin is talking about

00:45:02
and the the Paradox that she sees is

00:45:06
um is that as there's a kind of a

00:45:08
dispersion of activities at the same

00:45:11
time there's a growing need for

00:45:13
concentration okay the more dispersed

00:45:15
Global production networks the common

00:45:17
financial markets the more the need for

00:45:19
centralized control or control

00:45:21
capabilities over these markets so

00:45:24
that's kind of the Paradox of cities

00:45:26
despite uh the internet Etc or

00:45:30
virtualization of activities there's a

00:45:33
continued role

00:45:35
um for for face-to-face interaction

00:45:37
interpretation and limited set of cities

00:45:41
so why are APS located in a limited

00:45:44
number of cities

00:45:46
well she talks about different kinds of

00:45:48
part dependencies so it means that once

00:45:51
a situation establishes itself it's kind

00:45:53
of there's all kinds of cells

00:45:55
reinforcing mechanisms

00:45:58
so

00:46:00
if there's a concentration there's a

00:46:02
deep Market in services so if you go to

00:46:05
London for instance you're quite sure

00:46:06
that you will find everything

00:46:09
um if you have these kind of services uh

00:46:12
some kind of a labor market culture

00:46:14
where will emerge around that you'll

00:46:17
find a specialized labor there and yeah

00:46:20
in a lot of world and Global cities

00:46:22
think about New York uh or London some

00:46:25
kind of a yep culture young urban

00:46:27
professional culture has emerged within

00:46:30
these kinds of APs firms

00:46:33
um there's also a lot of synergies

00:46:35
between these firms and I'll tell you a

00:46:37
little bit more about that so also these

00:46:40
different ads firms work together as

00:46:43
they Service uh their clients

00:46:45
and what is even more striking is that

00:46:49
these APS firms in and of themselves

00:46:51
also become Global corporations so they

00:46:55
also set up International

00:46:57
networks either to follow their clients

00:47:00
or to be to remain credible as a global

00:47:03
as a global act okay so a number of

00:47:07
reasons why this kind of geography

00:47:09
reproduces itself and is increasingly

00:47:11
anchored in in a number in a limited

00:47:14
number of global cities

00:47:17
some empirics uh from a dear a colleague

00:47:20
from it will be much even clicking in uh

00:47:23
who did a kind of nice set of maps on

00:47:27
law firms in Brussels it's kind of

00:47:29
interesting to see that the

00:47:30
concentration in global cities you could

00:47:33
say when at the more abstract level also

00:47:35
translate into clusters at the

00:47:38
Metropolitan level and it tells us

00:47:40
something about you could say the more

00:47:41
micro sociologies and geographies of

00:47:44
these kind of Professional Services so

00:47:46
what you see is on the left hand side

00:47:48
law firms

00:47:50
um the big picture are foreign law firms

00:47:53
the smaller insect map is is Belgian

00:47:57
firms the number of commonalities

00:48:01
which is kind of the center of a very

00:48:04
rich neighborhoods or set of

00:48:06
neighborhoods in South Brussels is a

00:48:09
location of both uh I think Belgian

00:48:12
um Boutique law firms and also larger

00:48:15
Law Firm but one is foreign law firms

00:48:18
but what is special for the foreign law

00:48:21
firms they're very much concentrated

00:48:23
around the EU District okay so a lot of

00:48:26
activities either have something to do

00:48:28
with

00:48:29
uh deploy their clients that are located

00:48:32
there which is either directly the

00:48:34
European commission or

00:48:37
um or firms that's want to Lobby uh the

00:48:41
European commission and this is kind of

00:48:44
a process that we'll talk a bit more uh

00:48:46
when we do the

00:48:48
um the tour in Brussels in uh the end of

00:48:50
next week okay so micro geographies are

00:48:53
also uh produced microclusters produced

00:48:55
at the urban level the same as for

00:48:57
instance through in um in London has

00:49:00
some great work by

00:49:02
um cook at all not Captain Cook but

00:49:05
another cook so we cooked up this figure

00:49:08
um obviously what you see there is the

00:49:10
city of London which is also a very

00:49:12
particular uh jurisdiction in and of

00:49:14
itself it's it has some kind of an

00:49:17
exceptional rule that doesn't follow the

00:49:19
regulations of you could say the

00:49:22
continent in this case the UK in and of

00:49:24
itself the government in a very weird

00:49:26
way I never I can never recall how

00:49:28
exactly and I'm not even sure that

00:49:30
information is themselves but it's kind

00:49:33
of a self Corp I mean the self-regulated

00:49:36
self governed

00:49:38
um jurisdiction

00:49:40
on on the island

00:49:43
where corporations also have a large uh

00:49:47
say in okay so within the LA the limits

00:49:50
of the city of London uh you find

00:49:52
particular regulations there that's why

00:49:54
the stock exchange is located there and

00:49:56
all the financial institutions are

00:49:58
located around and then besides that the

00:50:01
specialized District the legal District

00:50:03
etc etc so this tendency of of seeking

00:50:06
proximity is also evidence yeah

00:50:14
firms also uh interact with one another

00:50:19
um so this is some work we did in

00:50:20
Brussels uh we took a corporate survey

00:50:24
uh aimed at uh APS professionals so we

00:50:27
we sent the survey around to it with a

00:50:30
league less expert ICT experts etc etc

00:50:33
bankers and they kind of listed how they

00:50:36
interacted with other APS firms either

00:50:38
in their daily practice for themselves

00:50:39
or as they uh were giving services to

00:50:43
their customers okay and what you find

00:50:45
is actually quite a bit of interaction

00:50:48
um with sector itself

00:50:50
uh and also particularly between sectors

00:50:54
and law and finance law accountancy and

00:50:57
law and against and financial services

00:50:59
so just imagine uh as a corporation what

00:51:03
often happens is that yeah when you

00:51:07
issue some kind of financial product

00:51:10
think about

00:51:11
um a share or something or you want to

00:51:14
go for a loan

00:51:15
then we need a financial institution we

00:51:17
need a law firm that needs to kind of uh

00:51:20
come up with a prospectus or check the

00:51:22
perspectives that is that is made by um

00:51:25
by financial institutions uh Auditors

00:51:29
and an accountant would have a look at

00:51:30
that so this is a kind of connected uh

00:51:33
thing to financial markets what we also

00:51:36
found is quite some interaction between

00:51:38
ICT and financial services this has

00:51:41
something to do with you could say the

00:51:42
digitization of finance that is

00:51:44
currently going on

00:51:46
um so quite a bit of interdependencies

00:51:49
between different sectors will also

00:51:51
explains why does the need for proximity

00:51:54
yes there's a question

00:51:58
that's a very good question

00:52:01
um what do I remember from these

00:52:04
percentages I think

00:52:07
um all right so I think the um yeah

00:52:09
that's it's standardized to the you

00:52:12
could say the largest link so we looked

00:52:14
at you could say the intensity of

00:52:15
interactions and we found that within

00:52:17
financial services this has the

00:52:19
strongest link so

00:52:21
it's it's a it's a relative scale so

00:52:23
that's the strongest link it's uh 100

00:52:26
and then you when you for instance look

00:52:28
at the relation between law and

00:52:30
financial services the strength of the

00:52:33
tie between law and finance is only half

00:52:36
of the kind of relations within Finance

00:52:38
itself

00:52:43
um it was measured in a different way

00:52:45
it's measured uh by frequency so uh on a

00:52:50
regular basis how much do you uh hire

00:52:54
advice uh in you could say law etc etc

00:52:59
um

00:53:01
but there's other ways of of measuring

00:53:03
that for sure okay so it's it's one way

00:53:05
of doing that so yes this kind of

00:53:09
um gravitational pull towards other

00:53:11
actors in This APS complex explains kind

00:53:14
of the reproduction of global cities

00:53:16
another one was indeed this

00:53:18
globalization of strategies of uh APS

00:53:23
firms themselves so they're both

00:53:24
clustered and they're globalized at the

00:53:26
same time uh Deloitte

00:53:30
um well I mean it's part of its uh of

00:53:32
its branding process HSBC it's the same

00:53:35
thing so it's playing on both being

00:53:37
Global and tapping into local knowledge

00:53:40
okay you may think about that what we

00:53:43
want but it's certainly a part of their

00:53:45
corporate strategy or the geographical

00:53:47
strategy

00:53:49
Etc

00:53:50
okay yes okay that's probably early days

00:53:54
but are you guys looking at all about

00:53:56
how

00:53:57
coveted forward

00:54:02
uh no I was taking care of my children

00:54:06
um no uh but I think that's a good point

00:54:09
I mean

00:54:11
uh I think for sure there has been a

00:54:13
tremendous impact on business travel

00:54:16
but it's also kind of a long discussion

00:54:19
as to what extent you need business

00:54:21
travel these are the video conferencing

00:54:24
and other kinds of things

00:54:26
um

00:54:27
so there's already quite a bit of

00:54:29
research in there there's also you could

00:54:31
say more ethnographic approaches uh that

00:54:34
are kind of questioning

00:54:36
uh the actual data relevance of having a

00:54:39
global network but differently are these

00:54:42
offices really being used or are they

00:54:44
mainly there to have an address and

00:54:46
populate websites uh and then you may

00:54:49
actually find that it's much more

00:54:51
concentrated within a number of global

00:54:53
cities despite having a very Global

00:54:55
Network and there could be other ways of

00:54:58
organizing yourself either having

00:55:00
temporary clusters or meetings or

00:55:02
conferences to make things work that

00:55:05
there's also and we'll read a bit about

00:55:07
that a practice of circumference of

00:55:10
people that are that are based in London

00:55:13
that are then two years based in

00:55:14
Singapore so there are other kind of

00:55:16
strategies

00:55:18
um but yeah the main kind of question

00:55:21
will indeed be

00:55:22
um

00:55:24
covet now the final proof that there's

00:55:27
an end to the city

00:55:29
I think that's hugely overblown and I

00:55:33
think that's quite a quite a bit of

00:55:34
reasons about the knowledge and density

00:55:37
of certain practices that explains why

00:55:39
face-to-face and direction will prevail

00:55:42
just as uh when you think about teaching

00:55:45
there's hopefully some added value to

00:55:48
face-to-face teaching over looking at a

00:55:51
screen

00:55:52
and it has something to do with the

00:55:54
interpretation of information and is

00:55:56
being shared about how grounding

00:55:59
processes work do we think the same

00:56:01
about certain Concepts Etc and if you

00:56:05
don't do this face to face you just miss

00:56:07
out on this micro uh feedback loops if

00:56:13
this would be online I wouldn't see

00:56:15
nodding or frowning so I would be in

00:56:18
trouble sometimes okay so I think yeah

00:56:20
it's clearly it's a very important

00:56:23
question

00:56:24
there will probably be a more strategic

00:56:27
use of these sites and will also be a

00:56:30
more selective use of face-to-face

00:56:32
interaction which were done ultimately

00:56:33
also input

00:56:35
um

00:56:36
input APS activities and their

00:56:38
geographies but it won't lead to a

00:56:41
dissolution I think personally uh I see

00:56:44
no no theoretical reasons why that

00:56:46
should be obsolete

00:56:49
but it's uh it's it's research that

00:56:52
could be done and I mean there's a whole

00:56:54
class of uh of people digital Nomads uh

00:56:59
these are more you could say

00:57:01
self-employed they don't depend on other

00:57:03
inputs uh in their production process

00:57:06
think about setting up a website or

00:57:08
something you can just go to Bali and do

00:57:10
that from there but even there you see

00:57:13
uh the emergence of temporary clusters

00:57:15
other digital Nomads that are in Bali to

00:57:19
discuss stuff

00:57:21
etc etc so I think even there there's a

00:57:25
social aspect to that and you get the

00:57:28
return of centrality even where you

00:57:31
don't expect it and it seems to be

00:57:33
something that is related to the fact

00:57:36
that we're talking about cognitive

00:57:37
culture capitalism and that's a

00:57:40
excellent bridge to what Aaron Scott is

00:57:44
talking about

00:57:45
in his notion of global city regions so

00:57:48
we talked about world cities corporate

00:57:50
headquarters sussing talks about global

00:57:53
cities you look into a wider complex of

00:57:55
these Advanced Services that sit around

00:57:57
corporations

00:57:59
and then uh Alan Scott who says well

00:58:03
you and your world in global cities how

00:58:06
do you explain something like this which

00:58:09
is a much larger conversation which is

00:58:12
urban to some extent which depends here

00:58:15
on San Francisco

00:58:17
in case you haven't noticed but how do

00:58:20
you make sense of this wider San

00:58:22
Francisco Bay area with a lot of we

00:58:25
could say centrality but it's not

00:58:27
necessarily connected to poor

00:58:29
metropolitan areas so what kind of Alan

00:58:33
Scott is talking about and says yes uh

00:58:35
very nice that we talk about this

00:58:37
classic

00:58:39
um world and Global cities when you when

00:58:41
you look for instance she was talking

00:58:43
about New York London Tokyo later on

00:58:46
Chicago

00:58:47
uh neat metropolitan areas but there's

00:58:50
other kind of structures uh

00:58:52
morphological structures polocentric

00:58:54
regions that do not necessarily fit the

00:58:58
definition uh that that

00:59:02
Sasuke assassin or John Friedman is

00:59:04
talking about and that also links a

00:59:06
little bit to what we discussed last

00:59:07
week

00:59:09
um how the city looks like or where the

00:59:12
urban is can actually spill over

00:59:15
metropolitan areas okay

00:59:17
so clearly places like uh like Silicon

00:59:20
Valley

00:59:21
um they're not dependent on the poor

00:59:24
urban area per se but they also kind of

00:59:28
um an example of the need for proximity

00:59:30
and high-end Advanced sectors right so

00:59:35
what Al Scott says is that yes

00:59:39
something is right

00:59:41
but the kind of wider uh process that is

00:59:45
going on is a process towards centrality

00:59:48
in knowledge intensive

00:59:50
activities and this pertains to ABS

00:59:54
firms that are located and you could say

00:59:56
the poor metropolitan areas but it also

00:59:58
applies to high-tech firms the gaffa's

01:00:02
platform corporations etc etc all these

01:00:05
kind of innovations that came out of

01:00:07
Silicon Valley for instance or when you

01:00:09
look at the Pearl River delta which is a

01:00:11
kind of much more Polo Centric uh

01:00:14
production area in in the southeast of

01:00:17
of China

01:00:19
um it's also a form of centrality uh

01:00:22
where you have some metropolitan areas

01:00:24
or Metropolitan courts but it also goes

01:00:26
beyond there so what what interests Alan

01:00:29
Scott is more yeah this driver of

01:00:32
centrality Beyond APS themselves and it

01:00:35
says look at the centrality uh that

01:00:37
Sasuke assassin finds is actually part

01:00:40
and parser of a wider uh shift towards

01:00:43
cognitive cultural capitalism right so

01:00:45
CCC

01:00:47
and it means that a lot of economic

01:00:50
activities crucially depends on on

01:00:53
knowledge inputs and types of knowledge

01:00:57
that are not generic not standardized

01:01:00
that are not easily appreciable at a

01:01:04
distance no you need interpretation

01:01:06
dialogue with clients dialogue with

01:01:09
other colleagues to make sense of what

01:01:12
is going on because it's a very complex

01:01:14
matter

01:01:15
you need to make sense of the situation

01:01:17
collectively and hence there's a drive

01:01:20
for proximity there okay and this

01:01:23
applies to an increased uh part of of

01:01:28
the economy which also means that it it

01:01:31
goes Way Beyond the first producer

01:01:33
surface so and the spatial form it takes

01:01:36
is is one of global city regions so you

01:01:39
have a more polymorphic quality

01:01:41
polycentric kind of structure

01:01:44
and his kind of meta geography if you

01:01:47
will is a world of global city regions

01:01:49
with this kind of interconnection

01:01:51
interconnected and Blazer role in these

01:01:54
uh Global production networks in global

01:01:57
markets yes

01:01:58
yes

01:02:08
and this we need this kind of connected

01:02:12
to this APS that are all this service is

01:02:14
connected to

01:02:16
um well the point by Scott is that uh

01:02:19
yes in APS and law firms Finance Etc

01:02:23
there's a clear need for proximity for

01:02:25
the reason that we've been discussing

01:02:27
but this also applies to other parts of

01:02:29
the economy think about high-tech

01:02:33
um think about education or whatever

01:02:37
and these are also prone to this

01:02:39
agglomeration Dynamics and that is

01:02:41
because

01:02:43
um increasingly the production process

01:02:46
is knowledge intensive just compared to

01:02:49
um you could say 50 years ago it would

01:02:51
have been a very standardized process

01:02:53
just make 1 000 cars per week

01:02:57
this is becoming increasingly customized

01:02:59
uh it's much more about prototyping it's

01:03:02
much more about

01:03:03
tailoring uh particular cars I mean I

01:03:06
don't know anything about cars but I'm

01:03:08
I'm stuck with cars

01:03:10
so it's it's much much more uh just in

01:03:14
time delivery it's much more tailored

01:03:17
rather than than mass production that

01:03:20
used to be the case uh in the 50s 60s

01:03:23
70s and this has shifted

01:03:26
roughly in the 1980s where it was more

01:03:29
about flexible production systems where

01:03:31
you could say the connection with

01:03:33
suppliers but also customers clients

01:03:35
became much more important so it's a

01:03:38
kind of broad scale

01:03:39
restructuring of the economy which also

01:03:41
explains why proximity matters not only

01:03:44
in these Advanced administers but more

01:03:46
broadly to bitcoin I don't understand

01:03:49
what drives

01:03:51
these companies together in Silicon

01:03:55
Valley for example

01:03:56
okay well I have a whole lecture on that

01:03:59
and economic and financial geography but

01:04:02
I mean in part part of the story as you

01:04:04
could say the Contemporary benefits of

01:04:06
economic agglomeration which has

01:04:08
something to do with yeah what economic

01:04:10
geographers call positive externalities

01:04:12
by being there you get certain benefits

01:04:15
that you wouldn't get if you're not

01:04:16
there

01:04:17
stepping into high-scaled labor uh High

01:04:21
skilled labor for instance Venture

01:04:23
Capital etc etc but there's a lot of uh

01:04:26
what people call Cloud dependencies as

01:04:28
well and when you look at the story of

01:04:29
Silicon Valley there used to be a lot of

01:04:32
government investment there

01:04:35
um I think U.S military and the

01:04:37
semiconductor business making chips and

01:04:39
those kind of things was hugely funded

01:04:42
by the federal government

01:04:43
in NASA DARPA and all kind of Ministry

01:04:47
of Defense

01:04:48
and a lot of these Innovations within

01:04:51
later on commercialized by private

01:04:54
players

01:04:55
who then use these Technologies to build

01:04:57
their own platforms and there's great

01:05:00
work by Mariana matsukata for instance

01:05:02
who uh who's a great Economist who says

01:05:05
well if you look at your iPad

01:05:08
almost every critical

01:05:11
uh element there piece of technology can

01:05:14
be related back to some kind of federal

01:05:16
investment uh etc etc so

01:05:20
which brings certain to an argument

01:05:22
about is it really private Innovation

01:05:25
that we're talking about or does it have

01:05:27
something to do with sustained

01:05:28
investment by public authorities in

01:05:31
these kind of Investments the same is is

01:05:33
true for big Pharma for instance it's

01:05:35
universities that come up with new

01:05:38
vaccines and these are then

01:05:39
commercialized by Pfizer Etc

01:05:42
um so it's very complex story and no

01:05:45
clear answers it's a field of its own uh

01:05:48
but what we need to do we need to

01:05:50
understand is that this proximity and

01:05:53
the centrality goes beyond cities

01:05:56
themselves

01:05:57
okay so it's it's much more prevailing

01:06:00
process

01:06:02
but still I mean the point being is that

01:06:04
at some point APS firms uh even in these

01:06:08
Global city regions they would still

01:06:10
have some kind of a role to play as

01:06:11
connectors think about Silicon Valley

01:06:14
firms

01:06:15
um that come up with new technologies or

01:06:18
that want to make make a profit out of

01:06:21
these new Innovations

01:06:23
they would have to be kind of certified

01:06:25
patented their intellectual property

01:06:27
would be protected as probably very

01:06:29
likely that would be uh San

01:06:31
francisco-based law firms that would

01:06:34
then specialize in okay uh yep

01:06:50
well I mean they're not you now this

01:06:54
kind of these are the debates I'm just

01:06:56
rehearsing the debate of the 1980s 90s

01:06:59
slowly getting to the Northeast and

01:07:01
we'll we'll move through that uh

01:07:03
throughout the lecture

01:07:04
um

01:07:05
uh but this mainly tries to capture what

01:07:08
went on uh in the 1980s and what what

01:07:12
was the starting point if you will of a

01:07:14
theorizing of world and Global cities

01:07:18
right now

01:07:29
there was a belt yeah

01:07:33
well uh well there there so the question

01:07:36
is as to what extent is the Rust Belt a

01:07:38
global City I don't think I mean it it

01:07:41
would uh Alan Scott would really see

01:07:44
that as a as a global City region

01:07:46
because it's it's mostly you could say

01:07:48
uh a remnant of an older process of

01:07:51
industrialization which was much more

01:07:53
focused on mass production so think

01:07:55
about uh factories in Pittsburgh Detroit

01:07:59
etc etc

01:08:01
the fort Factory

01:08:03
um and this was kind of in the history

01:08:05
of the of the US it was a kind of

01:08:08
process of industrialization that was

01:08:10
finalized but on its returns since since

01:08:13
the 60s 70s and then you had to switch

01:08:15
to the Sunbelt States uh a lot of

01:08:19
production especially in the car

01:08:21
industry was taken over by Japanese

01:08:23
Investments and a lot of states where

01:08:25
the labor rights were less protected so

01:08:33
mm-hmm

01:08:35
I mean the difference would be uh to

01:08:38
what it's and I mean it's just one

01:08:39
example but the question would be to

01:08:41
what extent do uh in this day and age uh

01:08:44
knowledge synthetic intensive production

01:08:47
activities or other activities takes

01:08:48
place in the Rust Belt I think to some

01:08:50
extent this is the case but it wouldn't

01:08:52
be an uh a leading example I don't want

01:08:56
to be exclusive I think it could be

01:08:58
visualized as such but it would be more

01:09:00
of an empirical question to what extent

01:09:02
is actually taking place

01:09:04
um whether it's just a morphology of old

01:09:07
Industrial Area like the rural area or

01:09:10
whether there's some kind of an

01:09:12
integrated region which you do see in

01:09:15
Silicon Valley because it's kind of all

01:09:17
organized about technology

01:09:20
um we could perhaps argue that it used

01:09:22
to be a global City region of yesteryear

01:09:25
uh but perhaps the globalization was

01:09:28
less less advanced

01:09:30
there and then uh or at least it would

01:09:33
be would be different

01:09:35
okay just to say there's different

01:09:37
conceptualization let's try to capture

01:09:39
functions but also the morphology of

01:09:42
these places and I think it's something

01:09:44
to reflect on uh and comparing uh where

01:09:47
you get okay

01:09:49
um

01:09:50
yeah I think in the interest of time I

01:09:52
will have to move on because I I'm using

01:09:56
a lot of words uh but I think it's

01:09:58
important that things are clear

01:10:01
um so second of all and I might speed up

01:10:03
a little bit I want to give you a

01:10:05
methodological example of how people

01:10:08
actually dealt with this conceptual

01:10:11
apparatus of world and Global cities in

01:10:13
global city regions

01:10:15
to measure these processes or

01:10:18
empirically study these processes

01:10:21
so this is the work by the globalization

01:10:23
and world cities research Network

01:10:26
um and it basically starts with

01:10:29
um with a number of questions I mean

01:10:32
uh when you look at some of these claims

01:10:35
I mean it's it's one thing to say yeah

01:10:38
we have to acknowledge world city

01:10:41
formation process of global City

01:10:42
formation process or to say that

01:10:44
inter-urban connections are really

01:10:46
important and actually when you start

01:10:48
diving into this

01:10:50
and you quickly run into into trouble

01:10:54
um and this is actually something that

01:10:56
that was kind of loaded already in the

01:10:58
90s uh so a very long time ago but I

01:11:01
want to give you the entire development

01:11:03
of the agenda

01:11:06
um that is actually quite quite few

01:11:08
insight into uh world city Network

01:11:11
formation so we had a number of case

01:11:13
studies in the 80s and 90s especially

01:11:16
with Sasuke assassin on a particular set

01:11:18
of cities along the New York et cetera

01:11:20
Etc there was all kinds of hypothesis

01:11:22
and claims about the insertion in a

01:11:24
global Urban system

01:11:26
but actually empirically there was very

01:11:29
little insight into this so what

01:11:32
connects cities how Central was cities

01:11:35
in these Urban systems

01:11:37
I was kind of uh very much an ad hoc

01:11:41
answer that you get to the extent that

01:11:43
uh John Randy short said there's even a

01:11:46
dirty little secret in world cities

01:11:49
research actually empirically there's

01:11:52
very little on the actual connections

01:11:54
being made between cities so we don't

01:11:56
really know a lot about this this is

01:11:59
something that's uh kind of a research

01:12:01
Gap to use neoliberals uh academic speak

01:12:06
um

01:12:07
that uh that the globalization and World

01:12:09
Series research network was checked onto

01:12:13
um and there was a number of ways of

01:12:16
trying to to deal with that

01:12:19
um

01:12:20
people try to work with secondary data

01:12:22
in the 1990s of starting 1990s thinking

01:12:26
about for instance yeah uh looking at at

01:12:29
the flows of airline passengers so our

01:12:33
cities connected

01:12:35
um by by Airlines

01:12:39
this for instance gave rise to these

01:12:42
kind of

01:12:44
type of research and this shows you

01:12:48
say the world city Network on the basis

01:12:50
of Airline flows

01:12:52
any idea whether this is a viable method

01:12:56
can we measure the centrality of cities

01:13:00
in the global economy by using Airline

01:13:02
flows

01:13:06
bill

01:13:11
foreign

01:13:21
yeah so some major airports are not

01:13:24
necessarily in global cities yeah other

01:13:27
ideas

01:13:36
I couldn't find any data okay other

01:13:39
kinds of sources to be used okay so the

01:13:42
flow of Bitcoins okay yeah I'm bit more

01:13:45
particularly with with this kind of data

01:13:47
on airline flows other ideas yes

01:13:53
traveling or

01:13:56
absolutely different kind of attitude

01:13:58
absolutely yeah other ideas

01:14:06
[Music]

01:14:09
that's exactly the same I mean it's

01:14:12
debatable I mean are you measuring

01:14:14
economic importance or are you measuring

01:14:16
command and control

01:14:26
yeah that was also the kind of yeah

01:14:29
there's a hub and spoke system people

01:14:31
write about papers flying where you

01:14:34
don't want to go uh so it doesn't really

01:14:36
connect I mean there's a lot of people

01:14:38
in Reykjavik but not necessarily to um

01:14:41
to do anything there yeah and the other

01:14:44
ideas

01:14:51
yeah yes yes yes absolutely yeah okay so

01:14:56
I mean it's uh I mean at First Sight you

01:14:59
kind of can do something because it's a

01:15:01
kind of intuitive picture here

01:15:03
especially when you look at the top of

01:15:05
the hierarchy uh so you find that New

01:15:07
York and London is actually there uh but

01:15:11
then you quite quickly go into all kinds

01:15:13
of anomalies yeah

01:15:15
these Hub airports that's that um uh are

01:15:19
kind of not necessarily relevant tourist

01:15:22
destinations which tell us something

01:15:24
about economic importance but not

01:15:26
necessarily about the importance in

01:15:27
terms of controlling the global economy

01:15:30
which is kind of a different kind of

01:15:32
process

01:15:34
um

01:15:35
yeah I was going to say something else

01:15:37
about that but it's yeah uh I forgot

01:15:40
about it

01:15:41
um yeah so we can also think about about

01:15:44
new data Collections and

01:15:46
um so we have Bitcoins is one way and I

01:15:49
want to pick your brain a little bit

01:15:50
more on that but before that I mean just

01:15:53
saying that

01:15:54
uh one of the big struggles in the 1990s

01:15:57
that researchers Urban researchers were

01:15:59
confronted with and this is still the

01:16:01
case today and you'll probably note that

01:16:03
in some of your courses is that a lot of

01:16:06
the statistics are collected at the

01:16:09
state level and not necessarily at the

01:16:11
urban level

01:16:12
and Peter Taylor uh by now Emeritus

01:16:16
Professor that founded the globalization

01:16:18
of world city research not to always

01:16:20
refer to this notion of Statistics it

01:16:22
connected to

01:16:24
statistics and indicators that were

01:16:26
collected by the national state to

01:16:28
measure the national economy etc etc and

01:16:31
at some point the centrality of cities

01:16:33
in economic process

01:16:35
has only Krypton uh slightly so we we

01:16:39
have sometimes at the national level

01:16:41
indicators about cities but then

01:16:44
inter-city connections and flows it's

01:16:47
very hard think about trade flows for

01:16:49
instance

01:16:50
it's between National economies but you

01:16:54
really have to assume that probably

01:16:56
the major metropolitan areas will be

01:16:59
more tight into this process than others

01:17:01
yes

01:17:09
um

01:17:10
sorry yeah

01:17:12
um yeah or like South American

01:17:13
interviews and a lot of resource

01:17:15
extraction happened in these places and

01:17:18
uh

01:17:20
no no but these yeah I mean it's always

01:17:22
a question and we'll return to that

01:17:24
about the the power of representation

01:17:27
this is the result of when you cut off

01:17:30
the list at some point so it's the most

01:17:34
connected places just in terms of

01:17:36
Passenger flows which is another reason

01:17:38
why it's not a parade example

01:17:44
yeah but you can turn it around and you

01:17:47
can focus on Africa uh African cities

01:17:50
and how they're connected in uh in

01:17:52
global global airline networks so you

01:17:55
could do some kind of if you will bottom

01:17:57
of analysis and it's actually something

01:17:59
that we did that we look at the

01:18:00
evolution of African cities and global

01:18:03
airline networks and it could tell you

01:18:05
give you a hint about how these places

01:18:07
are are internationalizing the

01:18:10
globalization Global globalizing through

01:18:13
their Airline networks but even then

01:18:15
could still be a very rough uh rough

01:18:17
figure and it would also as we found

01:18:19
capture other kinds of processes the

01:18:21
liberalization of the airline industry

01:18:24
in Africa rather than the increased

01:18:28
importance of someone

01:18:29
uh cities in the global Urban Network

01:18:32
so yeah just just to give you an idea of

01:18:34
what is the trouble when you start

01:18:36
looking for new kind of data you perhaps

01:18:38
can think a little bit about what other

01:18:41
kinds of summations uh you could use

01:18:44
and it was exactly kind of a conundrum

01:18:46
or thing that that people were were

01:18:48
chewing on in the 1990s and as it became

01:18:52
evident that some kind of new meta

01:18:54
geography uh was needed and I'm using

01:18:57
meta geography in a sense uh that it

01:19:01
refers to a social spatial structure if

01:19:04
you will that helps to make sense of the

01:19:06
world so it's a geography that explains

01:19:10
uh how processes work like the nation

01:19:15
states tells us something about to what

01:19:17
extent uh

01:19:19
identitarian politics is able to

01:19:23
territorialize I mean to to make it

01:19:25
difficult

01:19:27
whereas uh whereas perhaps

01:19:30
um the world city Network tries to

01:19:32
capture uh the integrated fashion of

01:19:36
economic processes and this is actually

01:19:38
what

01:19:39
uh what Manuel costells was writing

01:19:42
about in the 1990s when he was talking

01:19:44
about this space of float which you put

01:19:47
into opposition with the space of places

01:19:49
so he said well we have this traditional

01:19:52
view of the world as a mosaic of

01:19:55
territorial States

01:19:57
which are kind of yeah if you put them

01:20:00
together you get a world map but there's

01:20:03
another kind of geography that is out

01:20:05
there which is

01:20:08
discontinuous so it's it's kind of it's

01:20:10
not a continuous space these are kind of

01:20:12
islands if you will that are connected

01:20:15
to flows of goods people

01:20:19
um money knowledge etc etc so this is

01:20:23
kind of characterizing the space of

01:20:25
float and it's kind of it's a

01:20:27
socialization process this sociologist

01:20:29
so as a society emerging on that and it

01:20:34
was a kind of uh kind of visionary I but

01:20:38
I I he intended to be Visionary in a

01:20:41
sense that this would be the norm so we

01:20:43
would be become the network Society we

01:20:46
can wonder about that but what is kind

01:20:48
of still relevant I think is that

01:20:50
there's a tension between these spaces

01:20:52
of flows so these islands of connected

01:20:54
urban areas

01:20:56
uh which is to some degree detached from

01:21:00
a mosaic of city-states and there's all

01:21:03
kinds of oppositions between that if you

01:21:06
look at the election map in the UK not

01:21:08
the election map the referendum map

01:21:11
um and you look at the

01:21:13
leaf or remain

01:21:15
uh vote

01:21:17
it was clear that London uh wanted to

01:21:20
stay in which tells us something about

01:21:22
the importance of being remaining

01:21:24
connected to we could say other

01:21:26
Financial Centers on the European

01:21:28
continent the rest of Britain I mean

01:21:30
summarizing now

01:21:32
uh was was against that which shows that

01:21:35
there's a disconnect in the daily lives

01:21:37
of people uh to um to to the interest of

01:21:41
the city

01:21:42
um I'm not saying that uh the leaf uh

01:21:46
campaign actually connected to the real

01:21:47
needs of Brits but that's another kind

01:21:49
of discussion okay so this space is a

01:21:52
flows served as a kind of new method

01:21:54
geography which then was an impetus to

01:21:55
start collecting new data which

01:21:57
ultimately brings me to

01:22:00
um the god heuristic and I'll try to be

01:22:03
as brief as possible in the interest of

01:22:05
time it's also not something that you

01:22:07
need to

01:22:08
I don't know you don't you don't study

01:22:10
this by heart but it's a way uh to kind

01:22:13
of appreciate a certain methodology

01:22:18
um so just go to this website once at

01:22:21
least uh it's hosted by Loughborough

01:22:24
University in East England in the

01:22:26
Midlands

01:22:27
uh it's a very interesting source for

01:22:30
urban level

01:22:32
case studies uh studies on

01:22:34
connectivities between cities that you

01:22:37
can also use for other courses I'm

01:22:39
thinking of the course by bus for

01:22:41
instance so

01:22:43
um it's quite a quite an inventory of

01:22:45
nice case studies uh there so what's the

01:22:49
starting point of this you could say

01:22:50
project uh by globalization of World

01:22:53
Series research network was is let's

01:22:57
take APS firms as the clearest indicator

01:23:00
space species of this new space of flows

01:23:05
so there's a new space flows that

01:23:07
characterizes how the global economy and

01:23:09
Global Society works and as we read

01:23:12
castell's assassin it's very likely that

01:23:15
if we use these corporations we'll be

01:23:18
able to indicate a command and control

01:23:22
functions cities so the starting point

01:23:25
are the geographies of APs firms to tell

01:23:28
us something about world and Global

01:23:30
cities

01:23:32
the reason is as I explained earlier

01:23:34
these APS firms rnms and of themselves

01:23:37
International Players they are they have

01:23:39
a global City geography if you will so

01:23:42
it makes sense to start looking into

01:23:44
those

01:23:46
and the idea is that you can actually

01:23:48
build a model

01:23:50
on the basis of these APS geographies

01:23:54
and the model is based on

01:23:57
the co-presence the shared presence of

01:24:00
APs firms in multiple cities

01:24:04
summarize is one in one and whatever

01:24:09
it will make connection between these

01:24:12
two cities and we can assume that there

01:24:14
will be some kind of flow of probably

01:24:17
emails telephone calls ideas there will

01:24:21
be secondments people will travel

01:24:22
between these officers money will flow

01:24:25
between these officers etc etc so the

01:24:28
shared presence of APs firm in multiple

01:24:31
cities so one firm being located in

01:24:33
multiple cities so and there's three

01:24:36
steps with any model you need to specify

01:24:38
it then you can measure it it's filling

01:24:41
it with data and then hopefully

01:24:43
something comes out of this this model

01:24:45
okay

01:24:47
so yeah how does gork solve it so just

01:24:51
as a as a random example a number of

01:24:54
global or world cities New York London

01:24:57
Brussels Kuala Lumpur and Hamburg

01:25:00
and these are kind of

01:25:02
contain spaces with a number of firms in

01:25:05
there and these are our APS firms so

01:25:08
this is a model this thing cities and

01:25:11
they host APS firms so many firms are

01:25:14
actually the same okay so we have by now

01:25:18
uh transformed uh corporations such as

01:25:21
Audra Anderson Lesnar Von Clifford

01:25:23
chance the law firm Bruce Allen Hamilton

01:25:25
Lloyds as an insurance company so just

01:25:29
to give you some impressions

01:25:31
so how is it specified what does God do

01:25:34
it says well oh there's a firm here in

01:25:37
London or Brussels

01:25:39
how important is this firm actually okay

01:25:42
so you try to measure this in an

01:25:45
objective or at least standardized way

01:25:47
so that you make the same error every

01:25:49
time or that you write every time so you

01:25:53
say okay for this one office in Brussels

01:25:55
by Barclays or something or HSBC a bank

01:25:59
how important is it and we use a very

01:26:01
standard scale zero to five no offers ah

01:26:04
easy you give it a zero uh oh it's the

01:26:07
global headquarters then it's a five

01:26:09
okay and throughout the agent you see

01:26:11
but it would be I don't know KBC or

01:26:13
something like that large Belgium tank

01:26:15
okay and then there's a whole range in

01:26:18
between

01:26:19
a typical office would be two maybe a

01:26:22
regional headquarters and there's a lot

01:26:24
of those in Brussels that actually

01:26:26
control European activities uh would be

01:26:30
a three or a four

01:26:32
um so yeah this is kind of the idea

01:26:34
there's a hierarchy and office functions

01:26:37
and we can measure this in a

01:26:39
standardized way

01:26:41
nervous values

01:26:43
so imagine what the importance of of uh

01:26:47
the connection between uh two offices

01:26:49
would be so a very important office in

01:26:53
Brussels

01:26:54
a very important office in London would

01:26:57
probably generate more traffic in terms

01:27:00
of emails than phone calls which is then

01:27:03
again a proxy for you could say the

01:27:05
importance of the activities in global

01:27:07
command temperature okay so it's

01:27:10
basically calculating the Intercity

01:27:12
relation the R value there

01:27:15
by multiplying these service values so

01:27:18
very basic so you have a very important

01:27:20
one times a very important one gives you

01:27:22
a very strong relation between these two

01:27:25
places okay

01:27:27
it looks a bit like that you can imagine

01:27:29
the connection so

01:27:30
the thicker the line the more important

01:27:32
the connection between these kind of

01:27:34
offices uh and yeah

01:27:37
you can populate a complete Matrix with

01:27:40
that you could do that in Infinity until

01:27:43
you drop that or you don't have the

01:27:45
energy to look for more information on

01:27:48
office networks okay so but this is kind

01:27:50
of the basic model and it allows you to

01:27:52
do for instance this kind of thing so

01:27:54
there's three cities in this very short

01:27:57
list we drop Singapore and work and they

01:28:00
have these different kind of firms APS

01:28:03
firm a b c and d and we can could

01:28:06
imagine a bubble where you say okay and

01:28:08
firm a has a global office in New York

01:28:14
um a very important office uh or a

01:28:17
regular office in Singapore and a

01:28:18
regular officer

01:28:20
and it would be a bit different for b c

01:28:22
and d okay

01:28:24
so just one example out of thin air

01:28:28
what you can then do is start to measure

01:28:32
uh the connectivity of cities

01:28:35
thus far we've been talking about

01:28:38
first

01:28:40
and what the importance of the city is a

01:28:43
referral you can also think about what

01:28:45
is now the strength of a city's

01:28:48
connection based on the on the presence

01:28:50
of firms so what you do is you basically

01:28:53
summarize all these different ties

01:28:56
between cities for one uh for one city

01:29:00
okay sounds a bit complex but it really

01:29:03
isn't so what you would do is think

01:29:06
about the connection between different

01:29:09
cities on the basis of the corporate

01:29:11
Network so think about five times two

01:29:14
plus five times two would be the

01:29:17
connectivity generated by first theorem

01:29:20
doesn't be four times two New York would

01:29:23
be five times one uh in addition to that

01:29:27
and two times five and in some you would

01:29:31
get a figure of 48 that's purely a

01:29:34
relevant example but it would give you

01:29:36
the highest connectivity in uh in this

01:29:40
model right and then for the other kind

01:29:42
of cities we could do a similar exercise

01:29:44
for instance

01:29:45
it wouldn't be generating connectivities

01:29:48
for firm A and D because there's no

01:29:50
presence for these terms so you could

01:29:52
generate some connectivity or a and for

01:29:55
C it can also summarize that and what

01:29:59
you could also do is Express this as a

01:30:01
proportion of the most connected City in

01:30:04
this tiny example of New York and you

01:30:06
would get to say well entrance is four

01:30:09
tenths connected as well as New York so

01:30:13
New York is is our leading we're all

01:30:15
sitting here then we have Singapore and

01:30:18
then enter okay so a very very small

01:30:20
example to tell you how to structure

01:30:24
okay service values thinking about

01:30:27
connections between cities and then

01:30:29
summarizing these connections that gives

01:30:32
us an overall view of the productivity

01:30:34
of a city in the world uh sitting okay

01:30:39
so we have specified the model and then

01:30:43
you can start measuring it and filling

01:30:45
it with data

01:30:48
um and how has gork done this well the

01:30:52
specification obviously refers to the

01:30:54
aps firms and um and it's kind of nice

01:30:58
is that this measurement has occurred

01:31:01
several times since I think 2000 but

01:31:04
every time in the same way so kind of

01:31:06
definitions of uh of categories of this

01:31:10
kind of APs sectors has remained the

01:31:12
same there has been numerous kind of

01:31:15
reiterations of these measures so five

01:31:17
sectors are are connected to substance

01:31:19
interpretation currency advertising

01:31:22
Financial Services traditional insurance

01:31:23
law and management consultancy

01:31:26
basically what God does is the leading

01:31:30
firms 175 verbs based on Forbes and

01:31:35
other kinds of corporate corporate lists

01:31:37
uh that tells something about turnover

01:31:40
the size of these phrase etc etc uh are

01:31:43
kind of selected

01:31:46
and then what is also done is is yeah

01:31:50
you could do this with an infinite

01:31:52
number of cities well not infinite but a

01:31:55
very large list of cities but uh to

01:31:58
avoid a bit of I don't know it's not

01:32:00
bias but to

01:32:01
together manageable data set you could

01:32:04
say the largest cities or what we know

01:32:07
from certain countries as economically

01:32:08
important cities are selected in this

01:32:12
list so it's not a purely inductive

01:32:14
exercise it's kind of an informed

01:32:16
decision to include some uh cities and

01:32:19
other colors so a lot of firms a lot of

01:32:22
cities and then on the basis of

01:32:24
information uh that we that we can find

01:32:27
on corporate websites we make a decision

01:32:31
as to how important offices are

01:32:35
and then you can basically start uh

01:32:38
filling an entire Matrix so just an

01:32:40
example uh to to share a bit of how this

01:32:44
works I mean if you think about just

01:32:45
look at the website can be quite tough

01:32:48
but you can actually although a lot of

01:32:50
these websites find very detailed

01:32:52
information coming at the address level

01:32:54
of uh of these offices and a lot of

01:32:58
these corporations are very proud that

01:33:00
they're located in the meeting world

01:33:02
cities kind of a branding so quite often

01:33:05
you can find that yes

01:33:09
uh yes

01:33:11
to avoid defenestration that's a very

01:33:13
good idea

01:33:16
I think yeah I'm not sure whether it's

01:33:19
going to take away all the noise that

01:33:22
that's what you're aiming at

01:33:25
um so yeah so it's um

01:33:27
it's a freely accessible source of

01:33:30
information

01:33:31
but obviously

01:33:34
um it's also a bit of guesswork it needs

01:33:37
to come up with some kind of

01:33:39
interpretive guide to to reach

01:33:42
uh these websites and to make decisions

01:33:45
as to how you will uh give attachive

01:33:48
value to these stories okay just one uh

01:33:52
for example and then you can build this

01:33:55
kind of matrices

01:33:57
so all the firms in a lot of countries a

01:34:00
lot of cities and then you can start

01:34:02
applying that problem okay so it's an

01:34:05
approximation of the importance of

01:34:07
cities in these corporate networks uh

01:34:09
and it has delivered a kind of sustained

01:34:11
analysis or modeling of these

01:34:13
interactions uh on that basis

01:34:17
and then maybe you already have seen

01:34:20
this kind of maps so a lot of uh world

01:34:22
city Network research and start to look

01:34:25
uh into the actual geography that we

01:34:28
produced so this is some research uh

01:34:31
from a while ago

01:34:33
um it just shows the the absolute levels

01:34:37
of connectivity so the global network

01:34:39
connectivity and the darker practices

01:34:41
are the most connected places and then

01:34:44
uh the lower

01:34:46
um the lighter colors so it gives you an

01:34:50
idea take a good look at this map

01:34:54
what you learn from that or where you

01:34:56
find striking

01:35:00
anything striking here

01:35:05
does it confirm what you thought

01:35:08
you learn new things

01:35:13
yeah

01:35:14
no

01:35:16
yes I am I'm pretty sure

01:35:22
this is the world mapping there are lots

01:35:25
of human things

01:35:27
so why are there so many Europeans to be

01:35:30
selected like you said like if you're

01:35:31
kind of making the largest cities

01:35:34
in Europe we don't have the largest

01:35:36
number of populations so I I don't think

01:35:40
no so but it's it's a list uh so this

01:35:43
there's a number of criteria I mean

01:35:46
population is one but it's also in in

01:35:49
certain countries I mean uh is also

01:35:52
looking forward to basically with known

01:35:55
economic importance so in Belgium uh it

01:35:59
would also include Francisco

01:36:01
uh which is absolutely another two

01:36:03
million uh inhabitant cities so but we

01:36:06
know it has important board activities

01:36:09
just to be clear these are not 525

01:36:12
cities within selection I think it's 123

01:36:15
so it's focusing on the most connected

01:36:18
cities uh which as a result

01:36:21
apparently gives

01:36:24
a geography that is skewed towards

01:36:27
it's a North America Western Europe and

01:36:30
then has a bit of presence elsewhere

01:36:34
yep

01:36:36
it seems like this

01:36:40
is

01:36:44
like that like there's like a whole lot

01:36:47
of economic relationships that are

01:36:48
Global that that business like that is

01:36:51
absolutely a good case relationship

01:36:54
um you know which like on an individual

01:36:55
level are probably not put the money but

01:36:57
like yeah

01:37:04
I I agree 300 so the question is I mean

01:37:10
does this represent citizen

01:37:11
globalization or does it represent the

01:37:14
location strategies of APs firms and to

01:37:17
what extent is this the same so it's

01:37:20
it's the question is to what extent you

01:37:22
go along and they claim that ABS firms

01:37:26
are an indicated species of commandment

01:37:28
control

01:37:29
I think to some extent this is the case

01:37:31
but there's clearly other processes but

01:37:34
I think and that's something that will

01:37:35
return to later on uh

01:37:39
we have to I think another key

01:37:40
distinguish between say more economic

01:37:42
geography readings whereas there's also

01:37:46
more urban studies critiques some people

01:37:48
would say that you're not capturing

01:37:49
globalization here

01:37:50
and there's other process we should look

01:37:53
at yes that's true but it doesn't

01:37:55
discredit one particular reading or one

01:37:57
particular focus on the process as long

01:37:59
as we're clear about what it is it

01:38:01
measures and what it is that it doesn't

01:38:02
but if I complete the example that

01:38:04
remittances I'll return to that in a

01:38:06
second is is

01:38:08
um it's very appropriate so this we have

01:38:11
to be careful that we that we

01:38:13
we're not switching to some kind of

01:38:15
Imperial uh

01:38:17
act here uh to try to claim that one

01:38:21
process dominate something but if we're

01:38:24
specific we can say something

01:38:26
same here it's uh the same period That's

01:38:29
a kind of comparison uh between two

01:38:32
periods in time if we I mean there was a

01:38:35
data collection and allows analysis in

01:38:37
2000 and then just before the crisis uh

01:38:41
in 2008 I mean the previous crisis I

01:38:44
mean I'm getting old

01:38:46
um so comparing uh the structure of the

01:38:49
world city Network which is effectively

01:38:51
on the aggregate level

01:38:53
um the structure of corporate strategies

01:38:56
and their geographies and I mean it's

01:38:59
kind of interesting to see that even

01:39:01
before uh the euro-american or North

01:39:04
Atlantic financial crisis there was

01:39:06
already a shift going on in terms of

01:39:08
strategic importance of cities in the

01:39:11
East and I mean both in Eastern Europe

01:39:13
and uh the global east so I'm talking

01:39:17
about uh Chinese cities for instance so

01:39:20
if for instance we're interested in in

01:39:22
secular shifts within the structure of

01:39:24
the world economy it shows that it's

01:39:27
also reflected in the corporate

01:39:29
geographies of these APS firms

01:39:32
which

01:39:33
knowing that they're important inputs

01:39:35
for Global corporations tells us

01:39:37
something about the relevance of these

01:39:39
cities and how Capital circulates on the

01:39:43
global scale so it tells us something

01:39:45
that everything and that's also and

01:39:48
that's also why Rob uses heuristic and

01:39:52
that there's some modestly connected to

01:39:54
that heuristic is a kind of a starting

01:39:56
point it's a searching device

01:39:58
when you say oh what the hell is going

01:40:01
on in

01:40:02
let's say Miami

01:40:04
it's dark red what could be the process

01:40:07
going on how does it explain that how do

01:40:11
you explain that it's one of the worst

01:40:12
uh performers if you will and lost so

01:40:15
much connectivity where it's a very

01:40:17
important Transit Hub between Latin

01:40:19
America and a North America

01:40:23
is why is it losing its functions uh is

01:40:27
it because Latin America is becoming

01:40:29
less important or uh for North American

01:40:32
Capital uh what could be going on there

01:40:36
I mean you can think about numerous

01:40:37
other examples uh there and it should be

01:40:40
I think and that's how I personally use

01:40:42
it the starting point for analysis and a

01:40:45
different set to a different set of

01:40:46
methods you could do a case study

01:40:49
follow the thing follow your nose and

01:40:52
try to problematize these kind of

01:40:54
filings but it's a way to refer to refer

01:40:57
back to that and it gives you and that's

01:40:59
I think the added value some kind of

01:41:01
standardized overview

01:41:05
there's a lot of things that's further

01:41:06
that we can say about that

01:41:08
um

01:41:09
I really need to press on uh because

01:41:12
it's taking a bit more time than

01:41:14
expected are you still okay to proceed I

01:41:16
promise that we won't take 25 minutes

01:41:19
but maybe 20 minutes

01:41:21
if I'm lucky

01:41:23
is that okay or you want a break

01:41:25
otherwise it's going to take

01:41:28
yes you can

01:41:30
um yeah is there a collective need for a

01:41:33
restroom break

01:41:35
is that a yes hand okay

01:41:38
uh yeah two minutes because we really

01:41:41
because

01:41:42
we can't take too much time so

01:41:46
if you project that in 20 minutes your

01:41:49
bladder will break uh go now

uh please take your suits

01:48:26
okay okay

01:48:30
[Music]

01:48:32
so yeah just one thing that you should

01:48:35
appreciate by now a long tradition of

01:48:37
Rural and Global cities research then

01:48:40
this kind of empirically informative but

01:48:43
at some point and especially the early

01:48:45
2000s there was a danger that or at

01:48:49
least this research agenda was was

01:48:51
interpreted as you could say dominant or

01:48:54
hegemonic even uh within Urban studies

01:48:57
or citizen globalization and as such it

01:49:00
also raised quite a bit of criticism

01:49:03
um and I think it's debatable to what

01:49:06
extent this is just quite at some points

01:49:08
it certainly is for the points I think

01:49:10
I'm personally but I'm also kind of

01:49:12
involved in these debates a bit more in

01:49:14
the wild well just take you through them

01:49:17
uh and I hope to do so within the next

01:49:19
uh 20 minutes

01:49:21
right uh I think we could say I still

01:49:24
think that the heuristic can be powerful

01:49:27
to the map and spatially analyze Global

01:49:29
Connections but uh clearly something can

01:49:32
be said that I'll just skip that and cut

01:49:35
the business one of the most important

01:49:37
uh could be a more most trenching

01:49:39
critiques was launched at the beginning

01:49:42
of the Northeast by a famous

01:49:46
um scholar Jennifer Robinson

01:49:50
um a South African uh working from

01:49:52
London

01:49:53
uh wrote a book uh ordinary cities or

01:49:57
whatever uh papers was

01:50:00
um world cities or a world of cities

01:50:03
where she kind of

01:50:06
um or was a bit frustrated with with

01:50:08
this dominance of world cities uh

01:50:11
research in the debate about citizen

01:50:13
globalization and it says she says well

01:50:16
it's quite a different thing to talk

01:50:17
about world cities or to be interested

01:50:19
in a globalization of cities more widely

01:50:21
right and that's good reasons for this

01:50:24
difference or the kind of the lack of of

01:50:27
what role in global cities research was

01:50:29
doing then in addressing cities in

01:50:31
globalization since and we've seen the

01:50:34
maps a lot of the cities around the

01:50:37
globe and especially in the global South

01:50:39
are basically dropped off

01:50:41
the physical literal map right so we

01:50:45
find that there's a lot of connectivity

01:50:47
in European Western European North

01:50:50
American Asian cities but there's

01:50:53
actually very little to be told about

01:50:55
African cities they're basically not

01:50:57
represented police

01:50:59
so it's an issue of representation there

01:51:01
in her view

01:51:04
uh but it also deals with

01:51:07
um with how we conceptualize uh world

01:51:09
and Globe cities and in her argument

01:51:13
um we've focused too much on a limited

01:51:16
number of economic processes whereas all

01:51:18
the kind of connections remain unsteady

01:51:21
and one of the examples that was already

01:51:23
given was yeah you can look at

01:51:25
remittances and you would get a

01:51:27
completely different view perhaps

01:51:30
on these Urban Networks

01:51:33
so when her kind of claim is that

01:51:36
by doing so by these say geographical

01:51:40
conceptual biases World Series research

01:51:42
has ignored role in position of numerous

01:51:44
ordinary cities in the global economy

01:51:46
and there's a tendency

01:51:49
to uh you could say offer a eurocentric

01:51:53
global City Theory and then projecting

01:51:56
that in other areas of the world so a

01:52:00
post-colonial critique

01:52:01
it's concerned with people say power

01:52:04
relations in the production

01:52:07
of theories and Concepts and how these

01:52:11
Concepts and theories are reproducing

01:52:15
uh existing inequalities and there's

01:52:17
these are also geographical so it's a

01:52:20
social spatial and evenness at the

01:52:22
global scale

01:52:23
we keep on kind of reiterating the

01:52:27
dominance of certain kinds of activities

01:52:29
come up with certain kind of maps

01:52:31
measuring things in a certain way in the

01:52:34
end we're part of the process and part

01:52:36
of the problem if you will

01:52:39
I think there's certainly an argument

01:52:41
had to be made there

01:52:43
um I think representation is problematic

01:52:46
in my own research that was also kind of

01:52:49
the starting point of why I was

01:52:51
interested in looking into uh Islamic

01:52:53
Finance as a way to understand Middle

01:52:56
Eastern

01:52:57
uh World City information processes not

01:53:01
to a traditional lens of the classic APS

01:53:03
firms but to look at okay to what extent

01:53:07
or local norms and ethics religious and

01:53:10
other regarding Finance

01:53:13
um giving rice to a global sector and

01:53:16
that's in and of its own that could then

01:53:19
also start allow us to unpack

01:53:21
inter-urban connections that was kind of

01:53:23
what I did in my uh my own work on

01:53:25
Islamic Finance so I I certainly am

01:53:28
extremely sensitive uh to this outcome

01:53:31
but at the same time we also have to uh

01:53:34
be clear that that part of this

01:53:36
criticism perhaps also out of place I

01:53:39
think uh Jennifer Robinson really starts

01:53:41
from an urban studies critique and she

01:53:44
wants to understand

01:53:46
um you could say globalization and its

01:53:48
plurality not just economic but

01:53:50
otherwise and even within economic

01:53:52
processes why diversity whereas for gork

01:53:56
I think the purpose is how can we

01:53:58
understand the reproduction of uneven

01:54:00
development on a global scale at least

01:54:02
in the freedomanian tradition where it

01:54:06
was about

01:54:07
how can we explain it indeed the fact

01:54:10
that that there's still under

01:54:12
development in Andre the Frank's terms

01:54:15
in in the global South does it have

01:54:18
something to do with the supporting the

01:54:19
position of these cities and macro

01:54:22
processes macro macro capitalist process

01:54:25
so is it something with

01:54:28
the extraction of value organized

01:54:31
through these corporate networks and

01:54:33
supported by its APS firms that actually

01:54:35
explains why these cities are not on the

01:54:37
map so is this a result

01:54:40
uh is this not a neglect on this place

01:54:43
it's the fact that these places are not

01:54:45
represented means they're either

01:54:47
bypassed by these core protectors or

01:54:50
that they potentially are are

01:54:51
subordinating in this process

01:54:53
which could then be a question of is

01:54:55
this really the case

01:54:57
uh can we look into this processor so

01:55:00
sometimes a bit of a confusion I think

01:55:02
uh between kind of a deliberate choice

01:55:05
not to include certain places whereas

01:55:08
some of these maps are actually to be

01:55:09
taken as as a result of a critical

01:55:11
analysis

01:55:13
I do agree that in a number of you could

01:55:17
say analysis that are more technical in

01:55:19
nature uh in terms of the world city

01:55:21
Network this kind of critical Edge was

01:55:24
sometimes lost and there's a kind of a

01:55:26
mission drift towards mapping networks

01:55:28
whereas the connection to process of

01:55:30
uneven development was less clear that's

01:55:33
a bit of my personal

01:55:34
uh crusade to um to make the connection

01:55:38
uh to the Critical Agenda again so this

01:55:41
but certainly

01:55:43
um Jennifer Robertson points us to to be

01:55:46
very clear about what it is that we are

01:55:49
measuring through this kind of goal

01:55:51
analysis and what we're not so it's

01:55:52
about placing them these kind of methods

01:55:55
in a wider uh you could say firmament of

01:55:59
of methods uh two to work with that

01:56:04
now it does also connect to what kind of

01:56:06
practice uh we which we wish to endorse

01:56:09
within the tradition of urban studies

01:56:12
in the sense that uh and this is kind of

01:56:15
our

01:56:16
um or my personal

01:56:18
disappointment with a lot of research

01:56:21
that has followed the work by Jennifer

01:56:23
Robinson from the South but there's a

01:56:27
lot of tendency with weird rich Jennifer

01:56:29
or Jenny uh and a very reductionist

01:56:33
representation of her legitimate claims

01:56:36
claims and we we actually wrote a paper

01:56:38
about this with the egregious title uh

01:56:41
kind of straw man speak uh where we kind

01:56:44
of deal with

01:56:46
um with distilling what is kind of

01:56:48
Justified criticism and where we think

01:56:50
it's a bit too much and what we

01:56:53
particularly regrets is that some of

01:56:56
this criticism has led to

01:56:58
disengaged or polemic pluralism where

01:57:02
it's a kind of rejection certain agendas

01:57:04
to do something else without taking

01:57:07
stock about of the knowledge that is

01:57:09
produced there so what we try to then

01:57:12
propose is some kind of a middle ground

01:57:13
is a more engaged form of urban studies

01:57:17
debate which also means that you can say

01:57:18
yes

01:57:21
like analysis analysis or relatively

01:57:23
research in general

01:57:25
we need to put it in its place but it

01:57:27
doesn't mean that we can try to work

01:57:29
with this Concepts to make sense of

01:57:31
places

01:57:32
beyond the short list of world cities

01:57:35
could be that I'm babbling and I'm

01:57:37
defending on explaining myself in

01:57:39
different kind of ways in unnecessary

01:57:41
ways but let me try to make it more

01:57:43
clear uh you can say ah Beirut Manila we

01:57:49
don't need a world city Concepts it's uh

01:57:52
well the world city is a euro-american

01:57:54
invention can't do anything with that

01:57:58
uh it could be something that you could

01:57:59
say uh they say yeah we need the concept

01:58:02
of the middle eastern city of the Asian

01:58:04
City because everything is particular

01:58:06
and then we need to build that theory uh

01:58:09
and then it's so unique and particular

01:58:11
that you you can't do anything

01:58:13
so

01:58:15
people disagree and say look

01:58:18
there's no one-on-one projection of

01:58:21
world city formation as a process on a

01:58:24
city like Beirut for instance or Manila

01:58:27
uh but we'll have to work with the

01:58:30
concept to see to an extent it does

01:58:32
explain something of what we find and

01:58:34
what extent it doesn't and perhaps we

01:58:36
need to enhance or tailor uh diversify

01:58:41
the concepts

01:58:43
and in the process we potentially may

01:58:46
even learn something about the place

01:58:47
that we we study but at least we still

01:58:50
remain in a position that we can speak

01:58:53
back to the original debate which is I

01:58:55
think the point of urban studies that

01:58:57
were not Lost in Translation but try to

01:58:59
connect to some kind of organized or

01:59:03
overarching debate even if you're

01:59:05
studying in very diverse places

01:59:08
now yeah I won't say too much about

01:59:10
these two cases because it's also part

01:59:12
of our discussion seminar but just to

01:59:14
point down the kind of contrasting cases

01:59:16
uh so in one paper we looked at Beirut

01:59:20
um which is kind of an interesting place

01:59:22
I mean we call it a city more by X path

01:59:26
uh we're also the formation processes so

01:59:29
what you see is a built environment uh

01:59:32
with skyscrapers

01:59:34
um they obviously took a hit and are

01:59:36
taking a serious hit uh currently uh

01:59:40
with the the entire term of the country

01:59:41
isn't

01:59:43
um but on the first side you would say

01:59:45
okay there's actually when you start

01:59:47
looking at APS activities it's actually

01:59:50
very little going on there there's a lot

01:59:52
of very little Regional headquarters

01:59:54
there's very little International firms

01:59:56
but when you then start looking into yes

01:59:59
remittance flows or and and the diaspora

02:00:02
you find that almost one-fifth of

02:00:04
Lebanese economy is made of out of these

02:00:07
remittances and a lot of it braces back

02:00:09
to ABS professionals that are located in

02:00:12
the Gulf so it's our it's our McKinsey

02:00:15
trained pedigree Consultants McKinsey

02:00:18
Liberty that is then advising the Saudis

02:00:21
or people in Dubai the Elites in Dubai

02:00:23
that earn their money there uh send back

02:00:26
their money and buy a hugely overpriced

02:00:30
apartment in the city center of Beirut

02:00:34
at the real estate market which is then

02:00:36
kept artificially booming by almost free

02:00:40
credits from the Central Bank of Lebanon

02:00:42
which is also the personal property of

02:00:45
the living families of

02:00:47
um of Lebanon so it's kind of connected

02:00:51
um now in any case uh it shows you that

02:00:54
if you follow your nose in a sense there

02:00:57
still are some characteristics of world

02:00:59
city formation especially in the role of

02:01:02
high skilled labor but it's a kind of

02:01:05
it's it's an impressive Regional

02:01:07
capacity building

02:01:09
Regional uh circuits of value that are

02:01:12
kind of connected back to the city

02:01:15
yeah

02:01:17
um so it's function as a kind of a

02:01:19
capital city to the region rather than

02:01:21
as a kind of server service deliveries

02:01:24
if you look at Manila it's kind of the

02:01:26
opposite you'd say wow a lot of

02:01:28
activities there a lot of APs firms

02:01:30
they're all there but then you when you

02:01:33
start looking into these activities and

02:01:35
there's something that Rihanna gleibert

02:01:36
has done

02:01:38
it's basically part of the largest one

02:01:40
of the largest Outsourcing sectors of

02:01:42
Tendencies uh that you find so a lot of

02:01:45
back office activities for Global Banks

02:01:48
and other kind of service providers but

02:01:51
it's not really command and control or

02:01:54
not at least not what we think of it

02:01:57
and it may also work through and what it

02:02:00
can explain in terms of the segmentation

02:02:02
of the labor market but because it would

02:02:04
not be high-end managers that are then

02:02:07
gentrifying neighborhoods

02:02:10
but it may give rise through a middle

02:02:11
class or something so it may result in

02:02:14
other kinds of Labor Market structures

02:02:16
but at least we can still refer back to

02:02:19
world cities and start comparing to what

02:02:21
is going on

02:02:22
so this is an example of an income

02:02:24
passing approach to try to encompass

02:02:27
diversity in your research design and

02:02:29
try to make sense of it okay so that's

02:02:32
how we solve it I won't say anything

02:02:33
more because I want to leave something

02:02:34
for the debating session

02:02:38
second uh point of criticism is uh

02:02:42
social constructivist critique

02:02:45
um again a bit the same in the sense

02:02:47
that representation matters and this is

02:02:51
the great work by Dory Massey uh who was

02:02:56
a uh trying to say nice economic

02:03:00
geographer from the UK

02:03:04
um

02:03:05
thought about spatial divisions of labor

02:03:07
was one of the leading voices and and a

02:03:09
lot of progressive debates uh in

02:03:11
geography

02:03:13
um and she also wrote a book

02:03:16
world city in 2007 uh where she kind of

02:03:19
engaged with with this agenda

02:03:23
and

02:03:24
um what she basically says in this book

02:03:26
is

02:03:28
um yeah

02:03:30
um

02:03:31
world cities are not just a given an

02:03:35
economic geographical reality based on

02:03:38
as we set the clustering of these abs

02:03:41
firms their labor markets Etc

02:03:44
but they are but they're also a product

02:03:46
of uh discourses representation

02:03:51
etc etc so they're mediated by political

02:03:55
interests

02:03:57
um Elites others and other actors that

02:04:01
project certain discourses about world

02:04:04
and Global cities and these also have

02:04:07
ultimately uh performative effects so

02:04:10
they they produce or co-produce certain

02:04:13
realities okay so that's kind of

02:04:15
knowledge Theory so the world

02:04:18
is also to some extent shaped by how you

02:04:21
represent this and then you can can be

02:04:24
an Ardent very strong believer of that

02:04:27
and say okay the world is almost

02:04:29
exclusively reducible to how we

02:04:31
represented whereas others would work

02:04:33
more in the kind of materials fragrance

02:04:35
okay not everything is shaped by words

02:04:37
right so

02:04:41
something to think about at what extent

02:04:44
Rapid Station actually matters now

02:04:47
during uh explains this for London

02:04:50
and she says yes it's a globalized

02:04:52
financial center but the way we perceive

02:04:54
it and the way the city reproduces

02:04:56
itself is the outcome of a decade-long

02:04:59
battle of representation which was led

02:05:02
by dominant Financial Elites politicians

02:05:04
not often uh not seldomly connected to

02:05:08
all boys networks that have been

02:05:10
projecting the world city status of

02:05:13
London and this has become some kind of

02:05:15
a hegemonic

02:05:17
unquestioned uh neoliberal growth

02:05:20
strategy okay it has been part of that

02:05:23
neoliberal strategy since uh the 80s and

02:05:26
the kind of ideas that what is good for

02:05:28
the financial industry is good for the

02:05:31
city what's good for the city is good

02:05:33
for London not good for London it's good

02:05:34
for the southeast of England

02:05:37
what is good for the Saudis is good for

02:05:38
the UK and uh dear Europeans with good

02:05:42
what is good for the UK is also good for

02:05:44
Europe so please deregulate Finance

02:05:48
so it's a rhetorical strategy she calls

02:05:52
uh the passport Toto where the park is

02:05:56
there to represent the whole so it's the

02:05:58
interests of the city of London which

02:06:00
are projected to be the interests of the

02:06:03
UK citizen and again as brexit has shown

02:06:06
this has been quite uh radically uh

02:06:10
rejected again

02:06:13
um

02:06:14
whether legitimately or not

02:06:18
um so yeah there's this neoliberal

02:06:20
growth strategy and it also was

02:06:22
connected to a legitimate legitimized

02:06:24
certain material decisions in the sense

02:06:27
that

02:06:28
if you look at this course is about does

02:06:30
hydro need a new uh Runway because of

02:06:34
capacity issues yes London cannot uh

02:06:38
keep up with its Global City status or

02:06:40
it cannot grow it its connection to new

02:06:42
Emerging Markets if it doesn't have an

02:06:45
extra Runway so please neighbors

02:06:48
go away or

02:06:51
needle your ears

02:06:54
um but we absolutely need this and

02:06:57
Global City discourse is there to

02:06:59
justify that but also when you look at

02:07:01
the Restriction of the UK economy and

02:07:03
70s and 80s I mean closing the mines etc

02:07:07
etc and this has produced very uneven

02:07:10
outcomes in the UK a lot of cities in

02:07:12
the north and hope mining areas

02:07:14
industrial areas saw a decline and at

02:07:17
that point what would have been

02:07:19
interesting is low interest rates or

02:07:22
that could boost investment to

02:07:24
restructure these peripheral economies

02:07:26
that didn't happen at that point there

02:07:29
was an inflation there was high interest

02:07:31
rates which made

02:07:33
but simply money very expensive

02:07:36
and which made that it was very hard to

02:07:39
seek investment in these areas and

02:07:41
obviously this was in the interest of

02:07:43
the southeast which generated an influx

02:07:45
into Financial Services Etc which then

02:07:48
further grew a global City London so

02:07:52
it's a particular political agenda that

02:07:55
is behind there that has produced there

02:07:58
another final point that we us as

02:08:01
academics or academics to be are not

02:08:04
neutral bystanders and her claim is that

02:08:07
especially when you start looking at

02:08:09
these world city rankings

02:08:11
um that Gog is claimed to produce this

02:08:15
is part of the problem it's kind of

02:08:17
fueling the self-fulfilling prophecy is

02:08:19
giving people in the city of London

02:08:23
the instruments and the exhibits to say

02:08:25
look uh we're still the leading City but

02:08:28
Dubai is closing please come on we need

02:08:31
further investment uh in the city or we

02:08:34
need the regulation or something like

02:08:36
that

02:08:37
um so that's kind of for also attention

02:08:39
critique and sense that yes

02:08:41
um world cities research is performative

02:08:44
in that sense

02:08:46
so yeah uh just a few uh slides there

02:08:49
and I'll return to that I mean the

02:08:53
pictures that we have of representations

02:08:55
that we have of London

02:08:58
um are the Blitzen Glam quite often and

02:09:00
it's typically the city but then how

02:09:04
cities kept the city of Lomas kept

02:09:06
working or the wise much important area

02:09:08
remains often undiscussed but that's

02:09:10
something that we'll talk about next

02:09:12
week

02:09:14
um

02:09:15
yeah and this is kind of uh Battle of

02:09:17
representation is ongoing this is a bit

02:09:19
of a dated figure it's still with uh uh

02:09:23
with Theresa May there who I was going

02:09:25
for a global Britain agenda uh and again

02:09:28
you see that yeah

02:09:30
um

02:09:31
uh this kind of City Elite is trying to

02:09:34
push it in the the whole campaign in a

02:09:37
certain way uh threatening to leave

02:09:41
um rapidly in the city of London which

02:09:43
would then impact you could say the

02:09:45
global City status of of that City okay

02:09:49
so it's kind of still the same

02:09:50
repertoire that is being used uh at

02:09:54
times when when brexit was was still uh

02:09:57
unfinished business

02:09:59
it's probably not still not unfinished

02:10:01
business but voila now I think uh and

02:10:05
then I really almost had to close

02:10:07
performativity is a very important

02:10:09
criticism that's something that we

02:10:11
should be very reflexive about it

02:10:12
basically means

02:10:15
the insights that you produce kind of

02:10:17
figures that you produce the maps that

02:10:19
you produce to what extent do they shape

02:10:21
and impact reality to an extent are they

02:10:24
picked up what is the responsibility of

02:10:26
a researcher to keep ownership over his

02:10:30
or her results

02:10:33
do we have an impact of that and it's

02:10:35
something that that is also very

02:10:37
important to reflect on in relation to

02:10:38
world cities and Global cities

02:10:41
and there I think my personal stance is

02:10:44
that we should probably not exaggerate

02:10:47
the influence of world and Global cities

02:10:49
research in the sense that it's only

02:10:52
part of a much wider phenomenon of of

02:10:56
City rankings etc etc and actually when

02:10:59
you start looking at it it's often the

02:11:01
ABS firms themselves that come up with

02:11:03
all kinds of rankings another much more

02:11:06
picked up in popular debates by

02:11:09
politicians that want to gain uh

02:11:12
a world in global City status rather

02:11:16
than referring to go in and of itself I

02:11:19
mean it would be a pleasure to actually

02:11:21
know that people read academic papers

02:11:23
but I think it's actually quite quite

02:11:26
limited so yes we need to be reflexive

02:11:28
about that but at the same time it could

02:11:30
maybe a little bit overblown and

02:11:32
rankings are produced uh probably by

02:11:35
other facts

02:11:38
um I'm sorry to run through this another

02:11:41
point is

02:11:42
[Music]

02:11:43
um

02:11:44
and a criticism a criticism that deals

02:11:48
with uh to what extent

02:11:50
uh world and Global cities takes into

02:11:52
account you could say political economy

02:11:56
um processes or the politics of global

02:11:59
City formation and I think that connects

02:12:01
uh to the work of

02:12:03
um of Doreen Massey

02:12:06
um and it's a kind of an agenda that was

02:12:08
pushed by new Brenner especially at the

02:12:10
high at the end of the 1990s

02:12:12
and he says well it's not just economic

02:12:14
geographies it's not just agglomerations

02:12:16
cluster etc etc uh what we need to

02:12:19
account for is the restructuring of the

02:12:21
economy

02:12:22
and what he says a rescaling of the

02:12:25
nation state

02:12:27
so the way uh capitalism is being

02:12:30
governed is not exclusively at the

02:12:33
national scale but something is

02:12:35
happening with that at the same time

02:12:36
it's becoming supranational so you get

02:12:38
all kinds of international organizations

02:12:40
IMF oecd etc etc in Europe we have

02:12:43
European Union that starts to

02:12:45
increasingly govern uh the economy and

02:12:49
at the same time there's a kind of

02:12:51
devolution growth and the importance of

02:12:54
regions of cities as governance layers

02:12:57
and some kind of kind of a hollowing out

02:12:59
of the national level so in the words of

02:13:02
of you know Brenner it talks about

02:13:04
globalization as the undoing of the

02:13:06
state whether as the re-specialization

02:13:09
or re-territorialization of the state

02:13:12
where it attaches itself to new spatial

02:13:14
layers and it calls these new state

02:13:16
spaces uh to which you have new kinds of

02:13:19
all kinds of new state projects growth

02:13:22
projects so

02:13:24
to summarize that seems a bit complex

02:13:27
but there's a shift in in how National

02:13:30
economies are being managed in terms of

02:13:32
spatial scales it's also happening in a

02:13:35
much more entrepreneurial way and I'll

02:13:37
say more that about that next week

02:13:40
but the point is that this these are

02:13:42
politically negotiated processes

02:13:45
and you can have a look at at this

02:13:47
overview slide uh to the kind of

02:13:49
detailed uh process that are going on

02:13:52
there but just to give one example they

02:13:55
also kind of gave last week Brussels is

02:13:57
kind of in this

02:13:59
straight jacket of the Brussels Capital

02:14:01
Region whereas it doesn't

02:14:04
um

02:14:05
refer to the spatial scale of the actual

02:14:08
metropolitan area or the economic weight

02:14:10
of

02:14:11
of the city

02:14:13
whereas in other context you see the

02:14:15
formation of

02:14:18
um of the larger metropolitan areas as

02:14:20
governance structures where Global City

02:14:23
from the foot is now trying to put a

02:14:25
high in life

02:14:27
it's a kind of more Global City region

02:14:31
organization which has its own

02:14:34
governance structure etc etc so there is

02:14:36
easier to appreciated than that emerges

02:14:40
when you compare that to Brussels so

02:14:42
it's it's a rescaling process and you

02:14:45
see that in a lot of European contexts

02:14:48
not seldomly also kind of pushed for by

02:14:51
the European Union who likes to see

02:14:54
the Europe of regions it's kind of this

02:14:57
idea that you need larger entities

02:15:00
um

02:15:01
city regions or regions to to kind of uh

02:15:05
take control over upscale economic

02:15:08
processes

02:15:09
so yeah a sensitivity to how the states

02:15:12
spatially reorganized itself to an

02:15:15
extent there's new governance layers to

02:15:17
manage also these economic processes

02:15:19
that was kind of also added to the

02:15:21
debate and then finally very final

02:15:24
slides is and it's kind of a critique or

02:15:27
a criticism

02:15:29
buy

02:15:30
um where people working in the realm of

02:15:32
financialization

02:15:34
I'll say much more about that if you

02:15:38
take the economic and financial

02:15:39
geography course it's

02:15:40
it's all about financialization but just

02:15:43
the point of the fact that

02:15:45
um

02:15:46
criticism deals with what it is that is

02:15:50
going on in world cities so it doesn't

02:15:53
really uh criticize the relevance of

02:15:57
command and control practices in world

02:16:00
and Global cities but it says that

02:16:02
perhaps the nature of these activities

02:16:04
has transformed over the past 20 or 30

02:16:07
years

02:16:09
so financialization what does it mean it

02:16:12
means that an increasing part of uh

02:16:15
economic processes or value-based

02:16:19
processes or profits generating process

02:16:21
not occurring you could say in

02:16:23
productive activities but is somehow

02:16:24
connected to financial circuits so

02:16:27
financial investments is by owning

02:16:30
Financial assets rather than actually

02:16:32
producing something uh that uh that

02:16:36
people get rich and it also explains a

02:16:38
runaway inequalities between those who

02:16:41
have large uh huge amounts of wealth and

02:16:44
others who who rely on their labor but

02:16:47
we'll say something about that next week

02:16:49
so financialization also means that

02:16:52
there's a lot of pressure on

02:16:54
corporations

02:16:56
two generate returns for financial

02:16:59
investors so it's not just about

02:17:01
competing with other capitalists too to

02:17:04
be the most efficient car producer of

02:17:06
cookie manufacturers it's also to do so

02:17:09
to generate as much shareholder value

02:17:12
compared to your to your competitors

02:17:14
it's one I mean this kind of called

02:17:17
corporate financialization it's the

02:17:19
restructuring of Corporations so that

02:17:21
the shareholder value is actually being

02:17:23
created

02:17:24
so

02:17:25
perhaps world cities are still about

02:17:29
seamless service for globalization so

02:17:33
the management of Global Production

02:17:34
processes networks but this other side

02:17:37
financial markets perhaps needs to be

02:17:39
taken much more seriously and these abs

02:17:42
firms may be more and borrowed and

02:17:44
Loyals and process of financialization

02:17:47
rather than productivist logics

02:17:51
um

02:17:52
so yeah just uh wait

02:17:55
um so yeah and I think

02:17:58
um this is what I say here World Series

02:18:00
may become like obligatory passage

02:18:02
points for other reasons than the ones

02:18:05
that have been assumed uh already and

02:18:07
that's why uh in one paper we talk about

02:18:10
an augmented world city uh hypothesis

02:18:13
it's not just about generating value

02:18:16
from productive activities but it's also

02:18:19
about extracting value to rent

02:18:21
extraction practices from those global

02:18:24
production networks and you can see that

02:18:27
for instance when when you see how

02:18:28
corporations attract funding uh you need

02:18:31
a whole uh amalgamation of of connected

02:18:36
ABS firms to issue in this case a Euro

02:18:39
law which is some kind of an offshore uh

02:18:42
investment instrument and this is a um a

02:18:46
firm a real estate Corporation

02:18:49
Northern Germany and it's kind of face

02:18:52
all these people to issue debt on a

02:18:56
global scale so to finance Its Real

02:18:58
Estate projects in Germany so world

02:19:01
cities are mobilized to attract funding

02:19:04
and to optimize that in a particular way

02:19:07
the same thing happens when you look at

02:19:10
the other side of the equation when

02:19:12
value has been produced the point is

02:19:15
that you

02:19:16
limit the taxes that you have to pay on

02:19:19
your Surplus value otherwise

02:19:23
shareholders won't be pleased and you're

02:19:25
competing with other firms to pay as

02:19:27
much shareholder value as possible and

02:19:30
this is a classic example by Google who

02:19:32
is using a double dutch Irish sandwich

02:19:36
to um

02:19:38
yeah to make sure that it's it's

02:19:40
minimizes its its uh its its taxes right

02:19:43
so

02:19:44
it puts I mean I studied the details and

02:19:46
I actually don't know them by heart but

02:19:48
places some intellectual property in

02:19:51
Ireland and that fermented through the

02:19:53
Netherlands goes back to Ireland and

02:19:56
then it passes through the Caribbean

02:19:58
um uh to optimize that circuit and this

02:20:01
is also something that firms like

02:20:03
Deloitte and law firms are also engaged

02:20:06
so it's the optimization of these kind

02:20:09
of financial structures uh amidst

02:20:11
financialization is also a very

02:20:13
important function of world cities so in

02:20:16
the end

02:20:17
I think to summarize the picture it's

02:20:20
about

02:20:21
um you could say representation you

02:20:24
could think about

02:20:25
um world cities as kind of Mount Everest

02:20:30
agglomerations of wealth that is being

02:20:33
generated and then will then spill over

02:20:35
across the territory but you can also

02:20:38
think about uh how's it called in

02:20:41
English the Marian deaths 11 kilometers

02:20:44
deep uh where a value that is being

02:20:48
produced elsewhere is being extracted to

02:20:51
and is basically uh putting a drain on

02:20:56
the global economy and if you look at

02:20:59
what happened during the financial

02:21:00
crisis

02:21:02
each of the financial sector created a

02:21:04
lot of surplus if you will generate a

02:21:07
lot of profits then came the crisis and

02:21:09
it I mean I think in Europe it was the

02:21:12
figure of 700 billion uh that the

02:21:15
financial sector was kind of bailed out

02:21:17
and it was even more in the U.S

02:21:19
it's huge figures of saving these kind

02:21:23
of activities where in general they're

02:21:26
actually putting a next drain on the

02:21:28
global economy

02:21:29
so we really have to think about world

02:21:32
cities in a critical way

02:21:34
what do they contribute or what are the

02:21:36
actors in world cities what do they

02:21:38
contribute and what what kind of things

02:21:40
effects are or more

02:21:42
problematic I'm very sorry to take a

02:21:45
little bit more of your time but that

02:21:47
was kind of four ways of being critical

02:21:49
about world and Global cities

02:21:53
there's no time for Q a now but next

02:21:55
week we'll continue and maybe we can

02:21:58
start with uh with some questions next

02:22:01
week week if you would have them

02:22:03
and uh we'll talk with the flip side of

02:22:07
the coin

02:22:08
about the flip side of the Chrome is

02:22:10
just polarization so what does it mean

02:22:12
world and Global City formation for

02:22:14
these very places

02:22:16
and these are the two texts that you're

02:22:19
warmly invited to read

02:22:23
thank you

# 3 Polarization in world/global cities

00:00:02
[Music]

00:00:11
um

00:00:16
[Music]

00:00:23
okay welcome everybody to the third

00:00:26
session Urban social geography

00:00:31
this week's topic is polarization growth

00:00:34
in global cities uh now at just a few

00:00:37
housekeeping announcements I think in

00:00:39
the meantime everybody has seen

00:00:41
schedules regarding discussion seminars

00:00:43
I think there's still some minor issues

00:00:45
here and there trying to get that sorted

00:00:48
as soon as possible but make sure next

00:00:51
week there will be a discussion similar

00:00:53
for each and every one of you so please

00:00:56
attend and if you're there to present

00:00:58
um stick to the guidelines which just

00:01:00
try to stick in 10 minutes of

00:01:02
presentation because it will be a tight

00:01:04
exercise in any case

00:01:07
try to practice a little bit at home so

00:01:09
that you stay within those 10 minutes as

00:01:12
much as possible

00:01:14
um and then we'll have a nice discussion

00:01:16
also be advised that we start with

00:01:19
excursions this Friday and we start in

00:01:21
Brussels for those uh Urban and urban

00:01:25
studies who are joining the global City

00:01:27
Brussels Excursion and as a reminder we

00:01:30
meet at 10

00:01:32
at the North Station Brussels North

00:01:36
and we meet at plus Simon Bolivar which

00:01:40
is the main square at the site of the

00:01:44
World Trade Center looking towards the

00:01:47
canal so Simon Bolivar and you'll see if

00:01:50
you're early either me wearing a very

00:01:53
special hat uh perhaps and some roses

00:01:57
and then if you're later you'll see a

00:01:59
whole bunch of people so you can't

00:02:01
really miss us in any case we'll be down

00:02:03
the stairs and somewhere on the Square

00:02:06
there's a few benches there we will

00:02:08
probably end around five at latest in

00:02:11
European quarter

00:02:14
uh and yeah uh you can bring lunch uh

00:02:18
but you can also buy lunch somewhere

00:02:20
there will be time over uh at lunch time

00:02:23
to actually uh buy things wherever you

00:02:26
want okay so that's not necessary I have

00:02:28
no idea what whether it will be this the

00:02:30
police check the weather forecast and

00:02:33
just accordingly and as I've learned a

00:02:36
pencil works better than a pen it's kind

00:02:39
of weatherproof although I hope it's not

00:02:42
a tornado that it's going to hit

00:02:43
Brussels okay

00:02:47
um right

00:02:48
so last week we've been talking about

00:02:52
you could say uh how to understand the

00:02:55
role of cities in the global economy the

00:02:57
whole discussion about command and

00:02:59
control functions to what extent uh

00:03:02
Power in This Global Urban system

00:03:05
relates to either headquarters and the

00:03:08
more classic world cities definition or

00:03:10
rather it refers to you could say this

00:03:13
amalgamation or complex of advanced

00:03:15
producer Services

00:03:18
um who collectively produce control

00:03:21
capabilities over global production

00:03:24
networks Global Financial markets we

00:03:26
also discussed plenty of uh critiques

00:03:28
different forms of critique on those

00:03:32
paradigms

00:03:33
what we'll try to do today is turn The

00:03:36
Coin around and

00:03:38
kind of in the spirit of uh John

00:03:40
Friedman's work back to the 80s if you

00:03:43
will

00:03:44
is also try to reflect on what extent

00:03:46
the insertion in these Global Urban

00:03:48
systems these powerful roles in the

00:03:51
global economy also affects the internal

00:03:55
structure of City so it's kind of this

00:03:57
macro micro link

00:03:59
last week we went from oh my gosh the

00:04:02
economy is globalizing uh what does this

00:04:05
tell us about uh the changing role of

00:04:08
cities in that global economy now having

00:04:11
established that centrality in the

00:04:13
global economy now we wonder to an

00:04:16
extent there are effects or implications

00:04:19
of that insertion on the social

00:04:21
structure of cities okay so it's kind of

00:04:24
the the flip side of last week's talk

00:04:29
so just to get started a little bit some

00:04:31
maps

00:04:32
uh was there a question

00:04:40
yes

00:04:44
I understand yes it was a bit packed so

00:04:47
let's try to have a break somewhere at

00:04:49
the um yeah at six something or five

00:04:51
past six yeah sure no problem

00:04:55
um yeah so Maps uh I I will yes

00:04:59
Apartments

00:05:04
the live stream isn't working

00:05:07
okay

00:05:09
or rather not okay

00:05:14
it is recording

00:05:19
[Music]

00:05:23
yeah

00:05:25
as you can see there's a red button

00:05:27
there and I think

00:05:29
the audio is supposed to work

00:05:34
zero viewers okay that gives us a hint

00:05:39
um let's see

00:05:43
the wrong link okay let's see

00:05:48
um

00:05:59
yeah

00:06:00
all right let me just put this online

00:06:08
ah

00:06:23
um

00:06:24
[Music]

00:06:42
um

00:06:42
[Music]

00:06:46
it looks awfully the same

00:06:51
doesn't it

00:06:55
[Music]

00:07:15
thank you

00:07:19
there's already one viewer

00:07:22
so that means it works three yeah I

00:07:25
think we're there

00:07:28
is it okay

00:07:32
yeah

00:07:33
all right then

00:07:40
okay let me just try to start again I

00:07:44
start with some Maps always nice as

00:07:46
Urban geographers here's a maps from

00:07:50
Australia that I will talk a little bit

00:07:52
more about in a second from the

00:07:54
opportunity Atlas in the US basically

00:07:57
shows you

00:07:59
um the median household income of

00:08:01
residents over a certain period so this

00:08:04
is Chicago the darker I mean the the

00:08:07
Bluer the Richer if you will the higher

00:08:09
the income and the more the US is read

00:08:13
it's it's lowering so kind of see is

00:08:17
very much kind of concentrated wealth in

00:08:20
the city center apparently of Chicago

00:08:22
and then you can say the peripheries and

00:08:25
this kind of other Rings uh of Chicago

00:08:28
with lower incomes and then going back

00:08:31
further from the from the center

00:08:34
Richter neighborhoods

00:08:36
um kind of the opposite picture here in

00:08:39
uh Detroit I'll show some examples from

00:08:42
the US because there's this great

00:08:43
material on that

00:08:46
um here we see a very large

00:08:47
concentration of say poverty or low

00:08:49
lower incomes in the city center or if

00:08:53
it's actually the city of Detroit which

00:08:56
interestingly ends at this kind of Road

00:09:00
here which is 80 mile roads which you

00:09:04
may know if you still know who Eminem is

00:09:07
he's been talking about this

00:09:10
um

00:09:11
I think he was born and raised somewhere

00:09:13
over there it acts as a kind of a city

00:09:15
limit uh you could say the inner city

00:09:17
neighborhood and also uh it's also kind

00:09:20
of a fiscal limit

00:09:22
um

00:09:22
uh at this at this point and we see that

00:09:26
actually it's it's a quite strong social

00:09:28
spatial divide between poorer

00:09:30
neighborhoods in the city center and

00:09:31
then richer suburbs you may know that

00:09:35
Detroit has gone into default a few

00:09:38
years ago so it's kind of uh a weird

00:09:42
situation because it it is a rich

00:09:44
agglomeration if you will but uh the

00:09:48
city itself which kind of ends at the

00:09:50
Eight Mile Road uh is quite poor so

00:09:53
there's a lot of people commuting into

00:09:54
the city that are quite rich but the

00:09:57
fiscal base of the city itself is kind

00:09:59
of it's kind of limited okay so quite a

00:10:03
a large rupture there in space

00:10:06
other examples are

00:10:09
Los Angeles a lot of inner city uh

00:10:13
poverty and very rich uh suburbs if you

00:10:18
will we all know Beverly Hills uh and

00:10:21
and those kind of

00:10:23
um areas

00:10:25
um this is Miami just another example

00:10:28
where we start contrasts at the

00:10:31
neighborhood level uh between say north

00:10:34
um Miami and South Miami and also quite

00:10:38
a start difference between

00:10:40
um let's say Miami Beach and the kind of

00:10:44
where the tourist areas are

00:10:46
and the continent if you will or what is

00:10:50
kind of interesting in the case of Miami

00:10:52
is that actually uh from a

00:10:55
climatological environmental perspective

00:10:58
it's actually quite safe to live onshore

00:11:01
and these are kind of the poorer

00:11:04
neighborhoods with kind of uh increased

00:11:07
strength of floods and those kind of

00:11:09
things we see some kind of a movement

00:11:11
back onshore also by richer people some

00:11:15
people call this climate related

00:11:17
gentrification we start seeing an

00:11:19
appreciation of real estate values on

00:11:22
Shore so it kind of shows that that

00:11:24
environmental impacts all so

00:11:27
kind of start impacting social spatial

00:11:29
divisions another example

00:11:32
um

00:11:34
of New Orleans as you may know

00:11:38
from more than a decade ago it was hit

00:11:41
by a a large hurricane and also had a

00:11:46
very differentiated effect in racialized

00:11:49
and ethnic terms a lot of people were

00:11:52
were hit were left without help a lot of

00:11:54
people residing in these poor

00:11:56
neighborhoods often also had a different

00:11:58
kind of ethnic background

00:12:02
um

00:12:03
so again quite a bit of Divisions there

00:12:07
um San Francisco

00:12:09
um

00:12:10
looks pretty well gentrified uh also

00:12:14
kind of very common sensical I mean you

00:12:16
look at at real estate prices in The

00:12:18
Wider San Francisco Bay area and it's

00:12:21
obviously also related to this kind of

00:12:24
happiness or Global city regeness

00:12:27
regionalism that is that is uh going on

00:12:31
there but just still a few pockets of of

00:12:34
urban property for instance uh Chinatown

00:12:37
there to the north perhaps also the

00:12:40
mission which is a kind of a another

00:12:42
neighborhood yes

00:12:43
always the classification numbers

00:12:45
because it seems to know that the

00:12:48
distribution like that we had income

00:12:50
levels isn't kind of doesn't typically

00:12:52
normalized for the specific uh if you

00:12:55
know anything about that uh no I think

00:12:57
it's uh if you look at the scale it's

00:12:59
the same everywhere right so uh so you

00:13:02
can compare across cities as well and

00:13:06
it's a good point it could mean that we

00:13:08
kind of lose some of the Nuance in

00:13:10
certain places

00:13:12
but what you gain is comparability

00:13:14
across across cities but I can say a bit

00:13:17
more about that in a second

00:13:18
New York uh a city that will be talking

00:13:21
more about uh very kind of Rich Lower

00:13:25
Manhattan if you go to the north I feel

00:13:28
a bit like a weatherman here I'm going

00:13:30
to the north it's uh

00:13:32
it's as we know

00:13:35
um a bit more cloudy no I mean it's a

00:13:38
it's a an area with with lower incomes

00:13:41
uh the Bronx an interesting areas also

00:13:45
here

00:13:45
um Brooklyn

00:13:47
which we'll be talking about a bit later

00:13:49
uh which kind of follows the income uh

00:13:53
characteristics of of Manhattan there's

00:13:57
kind of still Lower East and we have

00:14:00
like a Little Italy and those kind of

00:14:01
places who are still you could say uh

00:14:05
giving some shelter to people that are

00:14:07
not crazy Rich

00:14:09
um but you could say a lot of

00:14:12
concentrated 12 in the center then or

00:14:15
what kind of area with with the poorer

00:14:17
population and then you could say uh the

00:14:19
rich kind of suburbs Begin Again

00:14:22
now the point is not necessarily today

00:14:24
to talk about spatial structures uh

00:14:28
you'll talk way more uh about that with

00:14:32
uh with Nick

00:14:33
and she'll discuss segregation patterns

00:14:36
and those kind of things what I want to

00:14:38
focus on is mostly you could say the

00:14:41
reality of it's a division uh income

00:14:44
divisions class divisions in cities so

00:14:48
where do you do these uh examples come

00:14:50
from this is a I think you'll find at

00:14:52
the great website uh it's it's called

00:14:55
the opportunity Atlas

00:14:57
and what I've actually it intends to do

00:15:00
and it also connects to the work uh that

00:15:03
of Nick or that the things that Nick

00:15:05
will talk about it tries to trace you

00:15:08
could say neighborhood effects and the

00:15:10
idea is that the neighborhood that you

00:15:11
raise them

00:15:13
we'll have a substantial role in your

00:15:16
future life chances

00:15:18
and they're they basically uh but you

00:15:21
can read more about about it on this

00:15:23
webpage they basically tracked uh the

00:15:26
evolution of people with a kind of Life

00:15:29
development or careers of people uh

00:15:32
linking it back to their original

00:15:33
neighborhood so to the places they were

00:15:35
born in so they could say okay people

00:15:37
that were born in the Bronx

00:15:39
16 years later

00:15:41
what is the kind of chance they become

00:15:44
incarcerated

00:15:45
what is their income level

00:15:47
etc etc so it's kind of in a way

00:15:51
uh trying to measure some form of

00:15:53
spatial privilege

00:15:55
by having a result or being born in

00:15:58
certain neighborhoods that will have

00:16:00
actually an effect uh which is in some

00:16:03
way you could say reducible to the uh to

00:16:06
the amenities that you have to the

00:16:07
social context that you have but perhaps

00:16:09
there's also even more than that maybe

00:16:11
it's some kind of an isolated spatial

00:16:13
effect beyond that so that's kind of The

00:16:15
Wider context of uh this Atlas And I

00:16:18
think yeah it's I would have hoped that

00:16:21
we had this for Europe it's a great

00:16:23
resource and you can you can browse a

00:16:26
bit do that but what I just want to

00:16:28
focus on today is the fact or use as

00:16:30
exhibits are these

00:16:32
um uh these income maps to illustrate

00:16:35
that

00:16:36
polarization in terms of income is a

00:16:39
day-to-day reality in a lot of U.S

00:16:42
metropolises had we had the data and

00:16:45
Europe we would also find uh quite star

00:16:48
contracts perhaps a little bit less but

00:16:50
still uh it would also be there so what

00:16:53
we can discuss then today I think is to

00:16:56
what extent class divisions

00:16:59
are reproduced in and through space and

00:17:03
actually try to understand why such

00:17:05
divisions occur in cities in the first

00:17:08
place now that's a very big debate

00:17:10
obviously what we'll try to do is try to

00:17:13
link that

00:17:14
to the debate we had last week and try

00:17:17
to link to what extents Global and world

00:17:19
city functions add to

00:17:22
existing polarization because

00:17:25
we cannot reduce it to an effect of

00:17:28
having headquarters or something

00:17:30
but perhaps entering uh the discussion

00:17:34
through globalized urbanization we could

00:17:37
actually start unpacking some of these

00:17:39
things so class divisions are about

00:17:41
the fact that we see social spatial

00:17:43
structures on the basis of social

00:17:46
groupings of

00:17:47
uh income profession occupational

00:17:51
structure and those facts so looking

00:17:54
through income levels and occupation we

00:17:57
find a social especially diverse

00:18:00
structure

00:18:03
now I use class here in a very let's say

00:18:06
uh analytical naive way because if you

00:18:09
use class

00:18:11
in many cases authors would also refer

00:18:13
to some form of identity formation

00:18:15
linked to that

00:18:17
that's not what I do here

00:18:19
it's more of uh much more mundane

00:18:22
looking at income levels

00:18:25
to look at the changing structure of the

00:18:27
city there's big debates to what extent

00:18:30
there is still such thing as class

00:18:33
identity

00:18:34
has something to do with existence of

00:18:37
subcultures depolitization etc etc

00:18:40
that's not really the point here it

00:18:42
would be an interesting debate it's more

00:18:44
about can we see objective objectifiable

00:18:47
divisions there in in society based upon

00:18:50
income and occupation okay just to clear

00:18:53
that a little bit

00:18:55
all right

00:18:57
um

00:18:57
so polarization

00:19:00
um it has been on the agenda has been

00:19:02
one of the main uh source of impetus or

00:19:06
or starting point for the world and

00:19:07
Global cities debate and again going

00:19:10
back to John Friedman and sort of wolf

00:19:12
in 1982

00:19:15
it's it's what kind of initiated their

00:19:17
interests there so just allow me to

00:19:21
recite with its towers of Steel and

00:19:22
glass with sensible shopping malls The

00:19:25
Citadel is the city's most vulnerable

00:19:27
symbol it's smooth surfaces suggest a

00:19:31
sleek and personality of money power

00:19:33
its interior spaces are ample elegant

00:19:36
and plush

00:19:37
and a properly secluded space is the

00:19:39
transnational Elites have built their

00:19:41
residences and playgrounds

00:19:43
country clubs and Bridal paths and

00:19:46
private beaches the overcrowded ghettos

00:19:48
exist in the far Shadows of the Citadel

00:19:51
where it is further divided into racial

00:19:53
and ethnic enclaves

00:19:56
some areas are Shanty towns none are

00:19:58
well provided with public services

00:19:59
garbages that does not get collected

00:20:02
only the police in the squad cars are

00:20:04
visible in evidence in many places

00:20:07
ghetto residents are allowed outside

00:20:09
their zones only during working hours

00:20:11
their appearance in the Citadel after

00:20:13
dark creates a small panic so it's kind

00:20:18
of a very dystopian image

00:20:20
you could say it's exaggerated it's kind

00:20:24
of

00:20:25
um not exactly empowering it's also very

00:20:28
black white but it's there's something

00:20:30
with this opposition that they that they

00:20:33
try to work with there's some kind of uh

00:20:36
growing divide in cities that is going

00:20:39
to become a social problem and that's

00:20:42
also what you also read in the world

00:20:44
city hypothesis of John Friedman

00:20:46
um

00:20:47
it's at some point it will become

00:20:50
everybody's problem and probably

00:20:52
probably also the problem of the elite

00:20:54
now again this kind of description tries

00:20:58
to capture a particular reality last

00:21:00
week I think I mentioned uh Robert De

00:21:02
Niro and Taxi Driver

00:21:04
uh perhaps

00:21:06
um uh John Friedman thought more talking

00:21:08
about contemporary La uh which is kind

00:21:12
of marked by The Citadel form uh to your

00:21:16
left uh if you've ever been to La I mean

00:21:18
a lot of Elites or people that are

00:21:21
walking around here never touch ground

00:21:23
they hover around they never go on

00:21:26
ground floor but it's kind of probably

00:21:29
dropped by a taxi in one of the hotels

00:21:31
and then they go at the first floor

00:21:33
level uh or second floor level in the US

00:21:36
from one building to another so it's not

00:21:39
only kind of uh horizontally segregated

00:21:41
there's also some kind of vertical

00:21:43
segregation there so that's kind of this

00:21:45
flow of people is not mixed with

00:21:48
um with bosses by

00:21:51
um then a bit further just kind of two

00:21:54
three four hundred meters is Bull Street

00:21:56
La uh not to be confused with Wall

00:21:59
Street in New York and this is kind of

00:22:02
where a completely different kind of

00:22:04
neighborhoods start so as you remember

00:22:05
this map from La

00:22:08
um in general you could say a very poor

00:22:11
uh in the city uh neighborhood

00:22:15
but kind of imprinted but by a number of

00:22:18
hotels

00:22:20
uh which kind of breathe post-modern uh

00:22:24
feelings and sentiments uh but then very

00:22:28
close to that immediately you're kind of

00:22:29
struck with with rapid kind of decline

00:22:33
um some people would call this a zone of

00:22:35
transition and we'll be talking with

00:22:37
Nick about the burgers uh model of of

00:22:40
cities there's a kind of a place that is

00:22:43
in change it's kind of changing

00:22:44
functions uh it's also a place where a

00:22:47
lot of uh migrants arrive

00:22:50
there's a lot of informal economy etc

00:22:53
etc and there's also kind of an idea

00:22:55
even in contemporary La that these

00:22:58
places The Citadel if you will these

00:23:01
hotels are also places that should not

00:23:03
be frequented by people that have

00:23:04
nothing to do there and just yeah as I

00:23:07
walk by I I think it was at the doorstep

00:23:11
of some of a plaza of Bank of America

00:23:14
something that I that I I took it um

00:23:18
yeah Bank Tower at Fifth Street

00:23:20
and it's kind of regulating social space

00:23:24
there and yeah you can't really read it

00:23:26
now but maybe you should read it at home

00:23:28
there's kind of very ambiguous language

00:23:31
being used so any activities that are uh

00:23:35
how's it phrase again that makes

00:23:37
annoyance or Muses that are

00:23:41
already annoying people or could annoy

00:23:43
people are actually not allowed there so

00:23:46
it's a very you could say uh ambiguous

00:23:50
fake description which gives for

00:23:53
instance social security guards the

00:23:56
Liberty to actually yeah remove people

00:23:58
from public space people that are

00:24:00
homeless and there's a there's a huge

00:24:02
homelessness

00:24:04
issue in L.A people are being displaced

00:24:07
even if they put offense in in downtown

00:24:09
uh there's a lot of panhandling selling

00:24:12
stuff and those kind of things and that

00:24:14
is kind of policed away so it's not it's

00:24:17
to be removed from from that public

00:24:20
space is because it doesn't fit the kind

00:24:22
of perhaps expectations of people that

00:24:25
that frequent these um

00:24:27
more like Citadel structures okay so we

00:24:30
could say it's still uh it could be an

00:24:33
extreme example but still very much

00:24:34
relevant today 30 or 40 years after uh

00:24:38
John Friedman was I was talking about

00:24:40
and this this is let's say one of the

00:24:43
the leading metropolis and economic

00:24:45
terms uh of the world

00:24:48
um so if it's happening here we could

00:24:52
imagine it's also happening elsewhere

00:24:54
okay

00:24:55
now what I would try to do now is look a

00:24:58
little bit into

00:24:59
exhibits about this archetypical case if

00:25:02
you will New York City

00:25:05
um

00:25:06
to show you a bit more how polarization

00:25:09
patterns have evolved over uh the past

00:25:13
decades

00:25:15
and I mean it's a Greek drama you know

00:25:17
already what is happening and the the

00:25:19
answer is polarization has increased so

00:25:22
income this disparities between

00:25:26
different kind of income groups in

00:25:29
society has increased and why New York

00:25:32
well I mean it's wonderful to say it's

00:25:34
has been one of the of the city's world

00:25:37
cities that have has received a lot of

00:25:40
attention uh it's still one of the main

00:25:42
uh Financial Centers of the world uh

00:25:45
it's kind of an extreme case if you will

00:25:47
if you try to research the impact of of

00:25:51
uh these kind of activities on the urban

00:25:53
fabric so

00:25:55
um I'm referring here to a very nice uh

00:25:59
study by the fiscal policy Institute

00:26:01
it's a bit dated

00:26:03
um but I still love it

00:26:05
um I'm actually hoping that it will do

00:26:08
the exercise again quite soon the

00:26:09
previous one uh report was just before

00:26:12
the crisis this one is kind of

00:26:15
diagnosing what went on just after the

00:26:18
crisis and I hope they have some kind of

00:26:20
I don't know uh mid-covets kind of

00:26:23
reports sometime soon but I mostly look

00:26:26
in these studies at the evolution of

00:26:30
income distribution and they use all

00:26:32
kind of weird terms such as desiles

00:26:35
quintiles quartiles which refers to the

00:26:40
place of an income group in the entire

00:26:43
population so a quintile is actually a

00:26:46
fifth of the entire distribution so top

00:26:49
quintile would be the top uh 20 of

00:26:53
earners and their average income the

00:26:55
bottom quintile would be

00:26:58
um the average of of the lowest 20 of

00:27:01
incomes right so these are relative

00:27:03
terms that show the position

00:27:06
with a certain income

00:27:08
what you would they position you would

00:27:10
take in this distribution okay and it's

00:27:12
usually focusing on income uh which is

00:27:16
income out of Labor

00:27:19
um in one way or another okay so this is

00:27:23
just one

00:27:24
um comparison and what they also do is

00:27:26
and they try to compare New York City

00:27:28
quite often uh sometimes they don't have

00:27:31
data on on New York City itself and then

00:27:34
they use New York state but try to be as

00:27:37
specific as possible

00:27:39
um and then they also try to compare to

00:27:41
the United States that's a question

00:28:01
yeah

00:28:03
uh I think I mean large really

00:28:06
polarization but the point is indeed and

00:28:08
that's kind of something that we get to

00:28:09
later

00:28:10
is that uh the question is if you

00:28:13
obviously more most easily start looking

00:28:16
at income because this kind of data are

00:28:19
easiest to find the next question is

00:28:21
what's the underlying occupational

00:28:23
structure so what produces that reality

00:28:26
uh and that's something that will pick

00:28:28
up uh on later and it's obviously

00:28:30
connected uh quite often kind of if you

00:28:33
think about the shift towards high-end

00:28:35
service jobs

00:28:37
would generate higher incomes

00:28:40
um

00:28:41
but the connection is not always there

00:28:44
is always highly contextual the same

00:28:46
kind of

00:28:47
um

00:28:48
occupations in different contexts may

00:28:51
give a very different income level and

00:28:54
that can be for a lot of reasons

00:28:57
so yeah but here we're talking about

00:28:59
income polarization uh to be sure

00:29:01
because it's it's it's the most obvious

00:29:04
Here and Now

00:29:05
so yeah as I said they try to compare

00:29:08
um city of New York but sometimes they

00:29:11
use New York State Etc so what you see

00:29:13
is here the median family income so this

00:29:16
kind of

00:29:17
people that are just in the middle of

00:29:19
this distribution this has been

00:29:22
declining over the past I think

00:29:25
um

00:29:26
uh 10 I mean in this case it's kind of

00:29:28
three to four years uh after uh the

00:29:31
creative session right so you see that

00:29:33
2008 2009 2010 2011.

00:29:37
um you find a steep Decline and it's

00:29:40
actually more more pronounced in uh the

00:29:43
city of New York so the city of New York

00:29:45
on average the median income was already

00:29:48
much lower than compared to New York

00:29:50
state which is kind of more refers to

00:29:51
the broader agglomeration mostly but

00:29:54
then also the rest of the state and it

00:29:56
was also significantly lower at the

00:29:59
United States so in general there's a

00:30:01
decline in median income uh in the city

00:30:05
of New York

00:30:07
at the same time what we see at the

00:30:09
other kind of sides of the picture is

00:30:12
the share of uh income total income

00:30:16
going to the top one percent and here is

00:30:19
again a comparison between

00:30:21
us and uh red then the state of New York

00:30:26
in green and then New York City kind of

00:30:29
smallest scale in uh blue which is on

00:30:32
top line so it's kind of interesting to

00:30:34
see and this data goes back to the 1980s

00:30:38
um they all share very similar patterns

00:30:40
here at the beginning the share of

00:30:43
income going to the top one percent

00:30:44
that's just reminds yourself one percent

00:30:47
of the entire distribution the top one

00:30:49
percent against the 99 remember

00:30:52
um was about 12 to 30 in the 1980s this

00:30:57
has exploded right so it has grown uh

00:31:00
across all scales

00:31:02
to something modest off you could say uh

00:31:06
22 in the US so one percent owns 22 of

00:31:13
all income just reflect on that

00:31:17
um and then in New York we see that

00:31:19
almost 45 most almost half of all income

00:31:23
is owned by the top one percent okay so

00:31:26
we all know Jeff Bezos and others uh but

00:31:29
this is kind of way more systematic yes

00:31:40
yeah

00:31:46
but the previous one yeah that's true I

00:31:49
mean this is just a figure

00:31:51
and it's one of these progress of liquid

00:31:55
possessions

00:31:58
yeah that's true that's right I mean

00:32:00
this is kind of you could say

00:32:02
uh the median income has decreased

00:32:05
everywhere uh it does seem to you do

00:32:09
seem to find here I would say that it it

00:32:12
decreases more in New York City compared

00:32:15
to others uh it's it's less you would

00:32:18
have to look at percentages there for

00:32:20
New York state or us but I think it's

00:32:22
it's kind of um going from 59 to 54.

00:32:26
yeah that's a very significant decline

00:32:28
but it's not one-on-one uh comparable no

00:32:31
you're right so this goes back way more

00:32:34
in time

00:32:35
um but the main point being here is that

00:32:37
a very small percentage is actually

00:32:40
running away with a lot of the income

00:32:44
and again indeed you see that here's

00:32:46
connection to what you were asking there

00:32:48
was a decline in general also for these

00:32:52
top one percent uh uh with the global

00:32:55
financial crisis but you also see that

00:32:58
it's kind of very quick rebound of these

00:33:00
highest incomes right so they they kind

00:33:03
of take a hit and that has something to

00:33:05
do probably with their fact that they're

00:33:08
exposed to so much parts of the economy

00:33:10
but then they rebounds uh quite soon

00:33:13
okay uh another kind of graph uh here

00:33:18
comparing New York state to the US so

00:33:20
unfortunately not at the at the city

00:33:23
level but yeah you get an idea here it's

00:33:27
comparing the top five percent in terms

00:33:28
of income and total income with

00:33:32
um

00:33:33
which you could say the bottom green

00:33:35
time so the the 20 uh lowest incomes and

00:33:39
then the middle group right so from 40

00:33:41
to 60 in the distribution so what you

00:33:45
find is that

00:33:47
um

00:33:47
over the years

00:33:50
um and this is comparing the late 70s so

00:33:53
you could say the mid 2000s so I mean

00:33:55
it's a dated analysis but that's uh the

00:33:59
furthest that they that they could go in

00:34:00
this analysis in uh the 1970s the ratio

00:34:06
between the top five percent and the

00:34:09
lowest incomes was 7.4 so people in the

00:34:13
top five earned 7.4 times more than

00:34:16
people with the lowest incomes in the

00:34:18
lowest quintile

00:34:20
um by the mid-2000s it had become 17.3

00:34:24
times right so take the income of the

00:34:27
lowest

00:34:28
um uh income households times 17.3 right

00:34:33
so tremendous tremendously growing

00:34:35
difference and it's also when you

00:34:37
compare it to the right growing much

00:34:39
faster uh than what you see in U.S in

00:34:43
general

00:34:44
and it still also pertains to the

00:34:47
relation between the top five percent

00:34:48
and but you could say the middle income

00:34:51
group or the middle class even there is

00:34:54
kind of these disparities have doubled

00:34:56
and they have have increased more uh

00:34:59
when you compare it to the US so it went

00:35:01
from 2.9 to 5.3 compared to uh 4.7

00:35:07
um when compared to yes okay so

00:35:10
massively increasing that difference so

00:35:13
it means that there's a growing

00:35:15
concentration of income and a very small

00:35:17
group

00:35:19
another exhibit showing this is uh

00:35:22
comparing the growth in income between

00:35:24
different groups so the bottom quintile

00:35:26
again lowest incomes actually lost a

00:35:30
share in total income

00:35:32
um when you compare the late 90s to the

00:35:35
mid-2000s

00:35:37
there was some growth for middle-income

00:35:40
groups and it was a very large group

00:35:42
that growth 18 to 19 in the income of

00:35:47
the life is good okay so the trends are

00:35:50
kind of clear it was a slow hiccup uh

00:35:53
with the global financial crisis but as

00:35:55
a kind of a secular Trend where a very

00:35:58
small percentage of the population yet

00:36:00
one percent or five percent is gaining

00:36:04
more and more uh share in the total uh

00:36:07
distribution I think

00:36:10
one way of of looking at that is why

00:36:14
that could be and we'll talk about

00:36:16
General patterns also more towards the

00:36:18
end of uh of today's uh session

00:36:22
is looking at what happens

00:36:25
um in evolutions of productivity so with

00:36:28
kind of with one hour of work what kind

00:36:31
of value do you produce how much cookies

00:36:34
do you cut or how much cards do you make

00:36:37
or how much

00:36:39
um you could say transactions Financial

00:36:41
transactions can you uh can you conclude

00:36:46
um versus the income from those

00:36:47
activities so what you see is that from

00:36:51
2001 until uh 2011 here there's actually

00:36:57
a 14 increase in productivity so for the

00:37:01
same hour of work you produce 14 more

00:37:05
wealth if you will

00:37:07
but when you look at the income levels

00:37:10
um from labor annual average real wage

00:37:13
so these are the the salaries that

00:37:16
people get

00:37:17
it has increased a little bit but it has

00:37:20
by no means kept base wet the Rises and

00:37:25
productivity left okay so it's kind of

00:37:27
it's running away

00:37:28
so there's an increase of about what is

00:37:31
it here two three four percent

00:37:35
um as we go across those uh 10 years

00:37:38
okay so that means that something else

00:37:40
is probably happening with the Weld and

00:37:43
value that's being created

00:37:45
and we talked a little bit about

00:37:46
financialization last week it means that

00:37:50
it's if it's not going to labor it's

00:37:52
probably going to the factor of capital

00:37:54
which means shareholders or uh you could

00:37:58
say well remunerated employees such as

00:38:01
CEOs managers who actually take uh a

00:38:05
growing piece off the cake

00:38:12
yeah this is New York

00:38:14
um

00:38:15
we'll get to more global patterns more

00:38:19
towards the end as a kind of an Outlook

00:38:21
exercise

00:38:22
but it's a trend that is that is

00:38:24
occurring across uh across countries

00:38:28
right and there's you probably know the

00:38:30
work of Thomas picketing it may have

00:38:32
rung a bell already uh he and his group

00:38:36
of we could say economic historians

00:38:39
have looked at systematically at income

00:38:42
data and income distribution data uh and

00:38:47
a more long-term perspective and they

00:38:49
yeah they can't compare all countries

00:38:51
because their data sources are limited

00:38:53
but they compare a number of key

00:38:56
European countries uh us UK Australia

00:39:00
etc etc so yeah these are unfortunately

00:39:04
um

00:39:05
patterns we see everywhere but in some

00:39:08
contexts they're more extreme than

00:39:10
elsewhere and US UK and we'll get to

00:39:13
that at some point are the most extreme

00:39:16
cases here

00:39:19
so yeah run away

00:39:21
um productivity but not necessarily more

00:39:24
remuneration

00:39:26
on the other side is and this is I think

00:39:29
a very telling graph is

00:39:32
to what extent uh can you make a living

00:39:35
a decent living if you work full time

00:39:39
on the minimum wage

00:39:41
right this was the analysis and I go

00:39:43
back again to the 1980s is it right

00:39:47
um

00:39:48
yeah or even earlier and you see that

00:39:51
during a substantial period of time if

00:39:54
you worked at the minimum wage

00:39:56
you were well above the poverty line

00:39:58
right so you had like 120 percent uh so

00:40:02
you could live if you will decently and

00:40:05
you wouldn't live in poverty

00:40:07
and this has completely melted away so

00:40:10
uh became uh very bad in the kind of

00:40:13
1990s but even well into today you see

00:40:16
that even if you work uh full time at

00:40:19
this wage you still fall below uh the

00:40:21
poverty line okay so it's kind of

00:40:23
something institutionally is wrong there

00:40:25
and the fiscal policy Institute has been

00:40:28
one of the main I would say Advocates

00:40:31
also for an increase in minimum wages

00:40:35
uh and yeah and a lot of metropolitan

00:40:38
areas also for instance in in London

00:40:42
there's also kind of uh demand for

00:40:44
London living wage uh which sometimes

00:40:48
should be higher uh than in the rest of

00:40:51
the country because the standard of

00:40:52
living it's just more expensive in these

00:40:55
large metropolitan areas okay so a very

00:40:58
dire picture a lot of people at the very

00:41:00
bottom are not only you could you could

00:41:03
say losing out in terms of income levels

00:41:05
it's also still it's not sufficient to

00:41:08
actually make a living uh when you're at

00:41:11
that site of the income distribution

00:41:14
so just to give you a bit of a picture

00:41:17
from this arguably extreme case of the

00:41:19
the sincerity of the situation

00:41:22
uh and yeah you can find this report

00:41:24
online pulling apart uh New York

00:41:28
um and I would recommend that you have a

00:41:30
look at that but I think the conclusion

00:41:32
is that we see uh in growing income

00:41:36
polarization in the state of New York

00:41:38
more narrowly in New York City

00:41:40
and it's becoming more dramatic than the

00:41:43
US average

00:41:45
okay over to you for another one to two

00:41:48
minutes group thing and I would like to

00:41:51
ask you why it is according to you that

00:41:54
specifically world and Global cities are

00:41:56
becoming so polarized okay and then

00:41:58
we'll take the question straight after

00:42:00
that go ahead

00:42:03
[Music]

00:42:16
thank you

00:42:17
again

00:42:19
[Music]

00:42:30
today

00:42:55
okay

00:42:57
thank you

00:43:14
I miss you too

00:43:37
[Music]

00:43:45
[Music]

00:43:56
thank you

00:44:00
okay let's hear it this is what you came

00:44:03
up with

00:44:04
you

00:44:04
[Music]

00:44:08
what did you come up with

00:44:12
yeah

00:44:17
a little areas

00:44:19
so let's speak for four people

00:44:23
so there's a comment about the cost of

00:44:25
living

00:44:27
okay but it's more you could say more a

00:44:29
symptom if you will I mean it's kind of

00:44:32
the price of real estate housing

00:44:36
um daily consumption etc etc

00:44:38
you could say it affects everybody

00:44:41
to a similar degree unless we

00:44:43
acknowledge that there's even more

00:44:45
differences I mean that's that the cost

00:44:47
of living for the rich would be also

00:44:49
very high but maybe they can afford it

00:44:51
it's not really an explanation of why we

00:44:54
see polarization I think yep I think a

00:44:57
lot of governments buy into the tripod

00:45:01
and so we see large companies which

00:45:04
already have a lot of capital getting

00:45:07
more subsidies from the government

00:45:09
getting

00:45:10
um

00:45:11
place in say special economic zones

00:45:13
where electricity land live around a lot

00:45:17
of things are subsidized uh

00:45:20
they're they're drinking well providing

00:45:23
um

00:45:24
employment however that said employment

00:45:27
the salary is not distributed so you

00:45:30
have the larger companies getting larger

00:45:33
what do you mean with trickle-down

00:45:35
Logics yes so I mean the the rhetoric of

00:45:40
that is of course that if you have a

00:45:43
large company

00:45:46
it provides employment and the ideal

00:45:51
scenario is to be more people with more

00:45:53
money except what often happens is that

00:45:56
the top one percent offset company will

00:45:59
probably get larger income and the

00:46:02
income distribution is quite skewed

00:46:05
so yeah this this important critique I

00:46:08
think that's also what for instance

00:46:09
Doreen Massey was talking about I mean

00:46:12
and throughout her career fighting this

00:46:15
kind of trickle-down Economics principle

00:46:16
and she talks about

00:46:18
because of global cityization

00:46:21
which is actually producing inequalities

00:46:24
which are not it's not just let's wait

00:46:26
for a bit more Global City formation and

00:46:29
it will be eased away

00:46:31
what he actually says no uh this

00:46:33
polarization is an outcome of global

00:46:36
City formation uh it's because you have

00:46:39
certain activities that we will have

00:46:40
this is not something it's something

00:46:42
permanent and not something that will go

00:46:44
away a bit more trickle-down economics

00:46:46
so because economics something with

00:46:49
the fact that you create multipliers

00:46:51
that money circulates to the territory

00:46:54
we can create jobs will then fuel growth

00:46:57
etc etc but little is said about the

00:46:59
income levels of these people uh what

00:47:02
kind of jobs are created what kind of

00:47:04
working circumstance Etc right

00:47:06
okay other ideas

00:47:18
um

00:47:28
capitalism just how do I make the most

00:47:31
money as fast as possible and the more

00:47:33
you try to do that and practically

00:47:34
intuition as possible the more exciting

00:47:36
social problems but you know it just it

00:47:39
like self-destructure the same sounds

00:47:42
so there's deliberate corporate

00:47:43
strategies but perhaps they can also be

00:47:47
more viable and some live touch

00:47:49
regulations compared to other places

00:47:51
yeah yeah

00:48:16
the

00:48:21
formulations

00:48:23
so yeah that's true there's a lot of

00:48:26
local policy that works towards creating

00:48:29
some kind of a business climate

00:48:31
of national policies that are

00:48:33
restructuring the detection of Labor etc

00:48:36
etc yeah

00:48:38
I mean I also think that the cities are

00:48:42
trying to struggle to attract global

00:48:44
companies and that at the end global

00:48:46
companies They Don't Really enrich City

00:48:49
budgets with the taxes because they

00:48:50
either evade it either the city trying

00:48:54
to once again attract those local

00:48:56
companies trying to subsidize them in

00:48:59
terms of substitute but then

00:49:01
like taxes is something to support the

00:49:04
lower weight of the more like insecure

00:49:07
parts of the population and then like

00:49:09
they uh like a low-income workers they

00:49:12
don't get the support of the city

00:49:16
okay let's

00:49:17
there was a lot of answers from there so

00:49:19
spatial redistribution yeah

00:49:28
Taxation and also creating social

00:49:30
policies so this is something in one of

00:49:34
the tasks he just mentions it's very

00:49:36
briefly about the uh develop

00:49:39
developmental State something like this

00:49:41
like this uh this process has changed in

00:49:43
things that have a more active role and

00:49:46
I think it's going to be something that

00:49:47
also shapes this polarization absolutely

00:49:50
yeah foreign

00:50:19
but you know there's a maybe a

00:50:21
concentration of people who derived a

00:50:24
larger portion of their income from

00:50:25
financialization

00:50:28
foreign

00:50:33
because I mean we also have to

00:50:36
distinguish between uh say processes

00:50:38
that work across the entire territory

00:50:40
they say okay what holds for countries

00:50:43
and what is so specific about some

00:50:45
places that they seem to be more

00:50:46
polarized than the rest of the country

00:50:48
okay yeah

00:50:58
minimum

00:51:03
thank you

00:51:08
easily removed

00:51:13
[Music]

00:51:14
awesome yeah uh at the end at the back

00:51:18
sorry sorry

00:51:20
um

00:51:21
yeah I was thinking about following the

00:51:23
responsibility for social reproduction

00:51:26
has been privatized and put on to the

00:51:29
individuals so especially in places like

00:51:31
the US where there's continual crises

00:51:33
it's extremely hard for the working

00:51:35
classes

00:51:36
of course with responsibilities

00:51:39
and then also like a privatization of

00:51:42
of column is going to do

00:51:45
and different quality

00:51:47
can you say a bit more about social

00:51:49
reproduction because it's a very

00:51:51
analytical term or kind of almost

00:51:53
theoretical term what do you mean with

00:51:55
that

00:51:56
um just like things like

00:51:59
um everything from Healthcare to taking

00:52:02
care of children

00:52:03
um yeah you know feeding your family

00:52:06
having them enough money for utilities

00:52:09
and things like that

00:52:10
right so and when it comes to the system

00:52:13
the worker itself needs to be produced

00:52:15
in a social way uh it's not a good time

00:52:18
making the worker I mean physically but

00:52:21
also educating the worker feeding uh I

00:52:24
mean kind of educating and socializing

00:52:26
them into a particular uh working

00:52:28
culture yeah

00:52:30
um

00:52:43
I guess ideas Rich the richest

00:52:48
before I feel like places where that is

00:52:51
more accepted like in the UK there's

00:52:53
like hot dogs like reality TV for

00:52:56
example like

00:52:58
um big brother like benefit the street

00:53:00
it like kind of created the idea that

00:53:03
the poor are just like messy people who

00:53:05
kind of think about their property

00:53:07
oh yeah

00:53:10
I I would agree but I think then the

00:53:13
question is to what extent would it play

00:53:14
out more in an urban context than say in

00:53:18
I don't know rural Britain maybe because

00:53:21
it's poverty is is less present there

00:53:24
although I would like to see a map of

00:53:26
that but yeah I think the power of new

00:53:29
liberal ideas is clearly going to but

00:53:32
okay one final idea

00:53:45
[Music]

00:54:05
um

00:54:10
so it has something to do with them

00:54:11
perhaps with um existing solidarity

00:54:14
networks it would extends there's still

00:54:17
solidarity between people uh and what

00:54:20
extent the urban environment still

00:54:21
supports that

00:54:23
you've covered quite a bit of ground I I

00:54:26
don't have it in my slides all of that

00:54:28
but I think it shows what you can do

00:54:31
collectively in trying to um try to pick

00:54:33
up this puzzle so so thank you for that

00:54:35
what I just want to do is is take you to

00:54:38
a number of slides because I think try

00:54:40
to gather a number of elements and then

00:54:42
work towards this polarization thesis

00:54:45
however fullable it is uh we'll try to

00:54:48
try to get there and then we'll take a

00:54:51
short break

00:54:52
so yeah uh conceptualization

00:54:57
uh have been written about this uh I

00:55:00
I've been mostly referring to the global

00:55:02
City but there's plenty of other kind of

00:55:05
scholarship on that uh as you can see in

00:55:07
this picture it has been one of the main

00:55:10
kind of

00:55:11
um

00:55:12
um you could say theorized conceptualize

00:55:14
uh problems of contemporary cities and

00:55:18
something with yeah what you do with

00:55:20
this uh with these dualities

00:55:23
um John monkov and Manuel constells

00:55:26
talked about dual City Susan Feinstein

00:55:28
wrote by divided cities Peter Marcus

00:55:31
another great scholar talk about quarter

00:55:33
cities

00:55:34
uh Buddhists talked about fragmented

00:55:37
cities Etc so it's kind of has been one

00:55:40
of the main debates in urban social

00:55:42
geography but it seems that uh all these

00:55:46
kind of uh things necessarily or or most

00:55:49
emblematically start to connect

00:55:51
um to cities rather than wider uh wider

00:55:54
territories and

00:55:57
um and and a lot of people start to look

00:55:59
for

00:56:00
um particular answers as I said last

00:56:02
week I tend to go back to the 80s

00:56:04
because it's kind of my my natural

00:56:07
cohort

00:56:08
um but quite often people go back to the

00:56:11
60s the 70s and this kind of wider

00:56:14
restructuration of of cities and wider

00:56:17
economies and we could say uh the North

00:56:21
Atlantic sphere so it's

00:56:23
I mean there's a lot of things have been

00:56:25
written there's a rich scholarship but

00:56:27
arguments it's kind of biased if you

00:56:30
will to say the crisis of cities or the

00:56:34
the crisis cities have underwent

00:56:36
in Western Europe Northern America okay

00:56:39
so there's plenty of stuff that needs to

00:56:41
be written uh on on the histories and

00:56:44
these historical trajectories uh of say

00:56:47
Chinese cities uh African cities etc etc

00:56:51
um

00:56:52
but it's not something that uh that I

00:56:55
can now cover uh today okay but

00:56:59
um

00:56:59
it's yeah kind of the general narrative

00:57:03
that you find in these different uh kind

00:57:05
of analysis is that the economic

00:57:07
restructuring kind of started uh in the

00:57:10
1960s 70s when

00:57:12
there's a culmination of the crisis of

00:57:14
what they call North Atlantic fortism

00:57:16
and as I I think explained last week or

00:57:19
two weeks ago

00:57:21
um there was this system of regulating

00:57:24
capitalism where there was a deal say

00:57:26
between the workers and capital that

00:57:30
increased productivity would uh

00:57:34
um that the fruits of that and the

00:57:35
surface of that would be shared with

00:57:37
workers okay this is kind of Ford going

00:57:40
back to to Henry Ford uh he he paid his

00:57:43
workers a little bit more

00:57:46
um so they would be more productive but

00:57:48
they could actually in fact also buy the

00:57:50
cars that they were producing uh at the

00:57:53
at the hellish speed okay so that was

00:57:55
kind of the Wilder model uh we saw the

00:57:57
emergence of the middle classes in the

00:57:59
immediate post-war era everybody could

00:58:02
could buy uh consumer goods because of

00:58:06
rising productivity levels uh it was the

00:58:09
invention of free time to actually spend

00:58:11
your money and consume it and so I can

00:58:13
actually go to shop Shops and and buy

00:58:16
stuff at some point this model kind of

00:58:20
started to crumble there were problems

00:58:22
with

00:58:24
um with productivity it couldn't keep up

00:58:26
with Rising uh wages

00:58:29
and kind of them at the macro level the

00:58:32
solution was

00:58:33
a relocation of production uh and you

00:58:37
could say the start point of

00:58:38
globalization the new international

00:58:41
division of labor the effect was that

00:58:44
there was de-industrialization and you

00:58:46
could say the core of the world economy

00:58:49
is high income industrialized places so

00:58:53
again we're talking about Northern

00:58:54
America Western Europe mostly

00:58:57
and it's set in motion the process of uh

00:59:00
structural and employment

00:59:02
which was

00:59:04
felt throughout countries and

00:59:06
territories but was very very Urban uh

00:59:10
in many contexts there was a lot of

00:59:11
productive activities within cities

00:59:16
um and as these active moved away became

00:59:19
obsolete what happened is that you could

00:59:23
say Urban poverty and unemployment

00:59:25
became very much Urban phenomena so

00:59:28
cities lost their functions productive

00:59:30
functions

00:59:31
but they had to deal with a lot of

00:59:33
things say the costs of unemployment etc

00:59:36
etc so we have a decline in tax base and

00:59:40
in many contexts what you see is a shift

00:59:43
towards

00:59:44
austerity so there's less income

00:59:47
so this budget cuts etc etc so the whole

00:59:51
idea and the immediate post-war era was

00:59:54
a strong Indian state so you had mass

00:59:57
production Mass consumption but also

00:59:59
with states that was inspired by John

01:00:01
men and he said okay if there's an issue

01:00:04
with uh with consumption

01:00:07
well the the government itself will be

01:00:10
the first investor will make sure that

01:00:14
um that the economy keeps on going that

01:00:16
kind of changed in the spirit as well

01:00:18
the state was seen as something that had

01:00:20
to roll back its activities stop

01:00:24
interfering uh with all kinds of uh

01:00:27
market-based processes and so this kind

01:00:30
of the starting point of uh the

01:00:32
neoliberal ideology

01:00:34
uh whereas the state was still kind of

01:00:37
setting the rules of Market uh Market

01:00:41
systems

01:00:42
it stopped indeed providing for instance

01:00:45
a whole range of public goods that that

01:00:47
were mentioned in many countries okay so

01:00:50
most of I mean accentuated this took

01:00:53
place in the US and the UK you could say

01:00:55
the new liberal heartlands or the

01:00:57
leading examples of that with uh that

01:01:00
Margaret Thatcher Ronald Reagan

01:01:02
but it started to creep in an effect it

01:01:05
became some kind of a mobile policy that

01:01:08
was also in practice being implemented

01:01:10
in other contexts

01:01:12
sometimes to a lesser extent in a more

01:01:15
variegated way etc etc and the whole

01:01:17
research agenda by Francis Jamie pack a

01:01:21
very nice uh and one of the leading

01:01:23
scorers in in urban geography

01:01:26
is about that so what is neoliberalism

01:01:29
what is neoliberalization is it the same

01:01:32
everywhere how variegated is it how does

01:01:35
it connect itself to different kind of

01:01:36
contexts that's that's the whole thing

01:01:38
so we see those ideas spreading a lot

01:01:41
across a lot of these say Western

01:01:43
European North American states

01:01:46
um and in in one way or another it leads

01:01:49
to some kind of to a self-fulfilling

01:01:52
prophecy because as the state Retreats

01:01:55
from certain areas

01:01:57
it deregulates very often

01:02:01
um a lot of these uh these markets which

01:02:04
hands more power to large corporations

01:02:07
and we already talked about uh

01:02:09
multinational corporations uh last week

01:02:13
and we see a rising concentration of

01:02:16
power of industrial and financial

01:02:18
conglomerations etc etc and indeed in

01:02:22
the process where also the state is kind

01:02:24
of rescaled where a lot of

01:02:26
responsibilities are kind of pushed to

01:02:28
the local level you get some kind of a

01:02:31
self-fulfilling Mantra of competing

01:02:33
cities to attract Global capital okay so

01:02:37
that's kind of the situation where a lot

01:02:41
of policy makers you could say in the

01:02:44
80s end of the

01:02:45
1980s were kind of facing uh a kind of

01:02:50
zero-sum game where there's only so much

01:02:53
production for instance to take place so

01:02:56
Amazon will uh will have its Center

01:02:59
either here or it will go across the

01:03:01
border and what can we do about that

01:03:06
well

01:03:07
David Harvey is one of the the the main

01:03:10
uh scholars in this area he says well

01:03:13
what we see that a lot of our policy

01:03:16
makers are trying to do is they try to

01:03:18
become entrepreneurial right so whereas

01:03:22
they were managing

01:03:24
the territories and trying to think

01:03:26
about

01:03:28
um the spatial structures of welfare uh

01:03:31
amenities and to distribute growth

01:03:33
across the territory you kind of get the

01:03:35
flip side a much more competitive idea

01:03:39
about growth and a new kind of role for

01:03:41
people that were previously managing

01:03:44
territories to become some kind of

01:03:46
entrepreneurs right

01:03:48
and David Harvey talks about this in his

01:03:51
famous piece and I think uh people and

01:03:53
miss and four cities also discussed this

01:03:55
with um with Matthew uh from uh he

01:04:00
describes the shift from Urban

01:04:02
managerialism to Urban

01:04:03
entrepreneurialism where you get a

01:04:05
different kind of mindset with policy

01:04:10
now

01:04:11
okay so this is kind of the Mantra is a

01:04:14
bit structuralist but it's kind of the

01:04:16
reasoning of how you could say macro

01:04:18
phenomena at some point lead to a very

01:04:21
particular Urban reality

01:04:24
um and what David Harvey then does and

01:04:26
this is a kind of a short excurse that I

01:04:29
want to take you through what it does it

01:04:31
says okay in this competitive

01:04:33
circumstances

01:04:35
we see that policy makers start to adopt

01:04:39
a number of strategies and a number of

01:04:42
entrepreneurial strategies and I'll take

01:04:44
you through them

01:04:45
be advised and sometimes it kind of

01:04:48
interesting to see that people think

01:04:50
there's kind of some kind of a recipe by

01:04:53
David Harvey say if your cities in

01:04:55
trouble please consider applying this

01:04:58
strategy this is not what David Harvey

01:05:01
does he kind of observes and analyzes

01:05:03
this phenomena he's not prescribing some

01:05:06
kind of entrepreneurial strategies that

01:05:08
then should be implemented by policy

01:05:10
makers just to be clear which reminds me

01:05:14
of an anecdote David Harvey I think once

01:05:16
gave a lecture in New York and he I

01:05:20
think he's famous for his analysis or

01:05:23
reading of of thus Capital

01:05:26
by Michael Marx volume one has very nice

01:05:30
videos on that he has a companion to

01:05:32
Capital

01:05:33
uh and also gave a lecture about that

01:05:35
somewhere in New York and apparently

01:05:38
there were also some investment bankers

01:05:40
in the room and after the lecture his

01:05:43
investment bank has walked up to him and

01:05:45
said well Mr Harvey I think you have a

01:05:47
very good understanding of how Finance

01:05:49
Capital Works would it be possible

01:05:51
possible to hire you as a consultant

01:05:53
[Music]

01:05:55
um I think he declined but yeah just to

01:05:58
be very clear I mean it's

01:06:01
um it's an analysis that he provides

01:06:03
it's not a recipe that it thinks that

01:06:05
should be installed okay all right

01:06:08
um

01:06:09
so yeah I mean the first kind of thing

01:06:10
that is under pressure if you will is

01:06:12
these productive activities or what it

01:06:14
sees is that

01:06:16
um some policy makers still manage to

01:06:19
kind of keep productive activities in

01:06:21
their territories and I mean that still

01:06:24
there will be some public and private

01:06:26
Investments and you could say the

01:06:28
physical and social base

01:06:30
um uh of course physical and social

01:06:33
infrastructure so think about knowledge

01:06:35
networks educational facilities uh try

01:06:38
to build Venture Capital sometimes the

01:06:41
state becomes some kind of venture

01:06:43
capitalist itself uh but indeed as has

01:06:46
been described also try to work on all

01:06:48
the things that are too costly uh

01:06:51
um reduce excessive labor costs for

01:06:54
instance

01:06:56
um tax breaks etc etc and that quite

01:07:00
often kind of leading the idea is that

01:07:02
the city regions should become yeah

01:07:04
silicon valleys uh that that should be

01:07:07
the ambition that they should seek to

01:07:09
attract Capital people

01:07:12
um sometimes this kind of set to attract

01:07:14
the creative class to refer to Richard

01:07:16
Florida but it's kind of this idea that

01:07:20
yes a high-tech productive city is still

01:07:23
mad imaginable and we have to create the

01:07:27
right business environment to get there

01:07:29
okay so images of clusters and there's a

01:07:33
lot of cluster policy but it used to be

01:07:35
I think in a lot of cities

01:07:37
it's also the reason why you had

01:07:39
dedicated districts Edge cities uh

01:07:42
linked to healthcare or biotech

01:07:45
etc etc so that's kind of one strategy

01:07:49
that is still imaginable for cities

01:07:52
the second element entrepreneurial

01:07:54
strategy is to compete for consumption

01:07:57
yeah so people have money to spend

01:07:59
there's a spatial division of

01:08:01
consumption what you want is that people

01:08:03
spend their dollars Euros uh rupees in

01:08:07
your country and your city and not in

01:08:10
the neighboring City okay

01:08:12
and obviously with globalization this

01:08:14
this kind of changes you see the

01:08:16
emergence of global tourism flows etc

01:08:18
etc so there's a kind of battle if you

01:08:20
will to attract tourists retirees

01:08:23
there's a whole economy behind Elderly

01:08:26
Homes uh because well these are people

01:08:29
who have pensions still and they provide

01:08:33
a safe stream of income

01:08:35
um

01:08:36
and you could say local consumption

01:08:38
activities

01:08:39
now there's a contradiction in

01:08:41
capitalism there because with the crisis

01:08:43
of fordism uh we see a decline in

01:08:47
purchasing power the factor labor is

01:08:51
typically less powerful

01:08:53
um so yeah there's there's less less

01:08:55
money to spend people don't really see

01:08:58
uh an increase in their in their uh real

01:09:02
wages as we've seen in the picture uh on

01:09:05
New York but this goes back to the 1970s

01:09:08
for instance when you see pictures of

01:09:10
the US

01:09:11
there has been hardly any increase in

01:09:13
real wages despite huge productivity

01:09:16
growth okay

01:09:18
um so this conundrum in many cases being

01:09:20
resolved by

01:09:23
reverting to uh to credit basically

01:09:27
um

01:09:28
so instead of kind of buying it from the

01:09:31
salary that you have

01:09:33
there's an increase to say

01:09:34
financialization of the economy in the

01:09:36
sense that a lot of households become

01:09:39
dependent on credits mostly through

01:09:42
banks to obtain housing but increasingly

01:09:46
also all other kinds of consumption

01:09:49
Goods Goods washing machines cars etc

01:09:52
etc

01:09:53
so this is kind of one way of solving

01:09:56
that that contradiction

01:09:59
um it's also uh trying to attract High

01:10:02
income jobs uh because yeah they have a

01:10:05
lot of money to spend uh and what form

01:10:08
does it take well in many cases uh it

01:10:11
will have some impact on the social

01:10:13
spatial structure uh it could be either

01:10:15
state-led gentrification it could be

01:10:18
market-based gentrification

01:10:21
um in many cases what you will see is

01:10:22
that cities will try to uh become more

01:10:25
attractive one way or another by using

01:10:27
Heritage uh architecture and these are

01:10:31
things that that you will also talk with

01:10:33
with boss about cities are kind of

01:10:35
transformed into these kind of urban

01:10:37
spectacles that are

01:10:40
collectively adding more value to the

01:10:43
goods that are consumed there so if you

01:10:46
walk around from the spectacular

01:10:47
neighborhood you might be inclined to

01:10:49
spend a bit more yes

01:10:53
yes

01:11:01
very also really increase the work of

01:11:04
the city like the one in

01:11:13
library and before that the seat was

01:11:16
very

01:11:17
popular and everyone was not really an

01:11:19
attraction and part of it

01:11:21
was very interesting yeah yeah yeah no

01:11:24
but it's it's kind of these these

01:11:25
examples of of landmark buildings uh

01:11:28
they're they're quite often they're used

01:11:30
in large scale reconversion number one

01:11:32
is is I think maybe you refer to Bilbao

01:11:34
all right that's Northern Spain yeah so

01:11:37
there was an old Industrial Area uh and

01:11:41
I think it's in the 1990s already

01:11:43
spectacular urbanism in the sense that

01:11:45
spectacular architecture usually there's

01:11:48
some kind of a mobile class of what they

01:11:50
call start attacks uh who are kind of

01:11:53
foreign

01:11:59
who connect to these Global circuits and

01:12:02
starts producing these kind of

01:12:03
spectacular architectural forms that

01:12:07
then send the message to the world which

01:12:09
can be then uh kind of linked to City

01:12:11
branding or city marketing strategies

01:12:14
Etc so the city in and of itself can be

01:12:16
consumed but also plays a role in

01:12:19
fueling consumption practices within

01:12:23
okay so that's kind of if you're

01:12:25
interested uh to hire David Hardy for

01:12:28
that he can advise you how to do that

01:12:30
and then the third third one is what he

01:12:34
says he said there's still

01:12:36
an element of the previous system there

01:12:38
but it's kind of transformed so and you

01:12:41
could say foreign

01:12:44
to kind of stimulate growth it was still

01:12:47
capitalist growth for sure across the

01:12:49
territory somewhat evenly

01:12:53
um so yeah there's you could say General

01:12:55
taxation there's a fund and it can be

01:12:58
invested across the territory and lower

01:13:01
level governments can still try to

01:13:03
attract some of that funding but it

01:13:06
becomes increasingly you could say

01:13:09
marketized as well quite often you'll be

01:13:12
competing with other cities and other

01:13:14
regions to start to attract these kinds

01:13:17
of redistributed funds

01:13:20
um just a number of examples in the U.S

01:13:22
it's it's about where our military and

01:13:25
defense Investments being made that's

01:13:28
the story of Silicon Valley in Europe

01:13:30
there's a lot of competition between

01:13:31
regions

01:13:33
um

01:13:34
for for instance a regional development

01:13:37
funds which work on both competitiveness

01:13:41
of of regions but also cohesion so it's

01:13:45
not kind of

01:13:47
100 evil or something like that but it's

01:13:50
a mechanism uh to yeah to redistribute

01:13:55
um these kind of Investments across the

01:13:57
territory but increase you could say the

01:13:59
capacity of these places for growth and

01:14:02
at the same time also work towards

01:14:04
providing amenities

01:14:06
uh Child Care etc etc people that are

01:14:08
joining me on Friday I'll say a little

01:14:10
bit more about that in relation to

01:14:12
Brussels the canalso for instance is one

01:14:14
of these zones of actions uh for the

01:14:17
European uh Regional development effect

01:14:20
when you look for instance people that

01:14:22
know Flanders a little bit

01:14:24
um you have stops feeling spray actin

01:14:26
urban renewal projects

01:14:28
it's kind of led by Flanders

01:14:31
um

01:14:32
and it's it's basically giving money to

01:14:36
uh to cities to reconvert Inner City

01:14:41
neighborhoods okay and quite often you

01:14:44
have to apply uh either you say okay I'm

01:14:47
going to hand in a concept note so you

01:14:50
get some some funding to develop your

01:14:52
idea and then perhaps if you're

01:14:54
successful later on you can attract uh

01:14:57
funding by uh by the Flemish government

01:15:00
but thus far you see that it's mostly uh

01:15:03
the Central City Central stadium so the

01:15:05
main agglomerations that have the main

01:15:08
capacity also to apply uh for these

01:15:11
funds so

01:15:12
it's not that all small cities can

01:15:14
actually uh benefit from that okay there

01:15:17
was a question

01:15:18
um

01:15:21
specifically is redistration Surplus

01:15:24
like looking at both electric economies

01:15:27
like governments are just financing that

01:15:31
they're all running down so they're all

01:15:34
running

01:15:36
deficits yeah deficits so I mean it is

01:15:39
that's an interesting like just looking

01:15:40
at it like Surplus but really it's like

01:15:43
making choices about where we're going

01:15:46
yeah yeah who's going to pay for the

01:15:50
future yeah but that's yeah okay so

01:15:52
there's a question okay uh governments

01:15:54
don't have money how can you be talking

01:15:56
about Surplus I think what I'm talking

01:15:57
about is the service that is being

01:15:59
created uh in the economy which is not

01:16:02
necessarily the same as the government

01:16:04
budget

01:16:06
uh which is under conditions of what I

01:16:09
would call permanent austerity is is

01:16:12
kept small and then the only thing that

01:16:14
you can do is is yeah say okay we're

01:16:16
going to become more efficient and

01:16:19
that's a a mantra that you hear often or

01:16:23
basically have very small cuts across

01:16:25
the board so I think uh it used to be

01:16:29
you could say more

01:16:31
um in the previous especially to for the

01:16:34
70s or something like that it's the

01:16:36
allocation problem was smaller because

01:16:40
the fiscal base was was larger there was

01:16:43
more economic growth which could be more

01:16:45
easily taxed without you could say

01:16:49
hurting corporations or people or

01:16:51
workers it's only at the point uh where

01:16:56
um you could say and yeah there was a

01:16:58
kind of stagnation of profits that it

01:17:01
became very hard for governments

01:17:04
um

01:17:06
yeah to how would I put this to um to

01:17:09
maintain fiscal levels

01:17:11
without eating into the profits of of

01:17:14
the corporations that were still there

01:17:15
so it's kind of a

01:17:17
yeah it became a very awkward situation

01:17:20
uh so they they rather kind of cut back

01:17:23
on on expenditures running to increase

01:17:27
um for instance corporate tax rates so

01:17:29
that could have been one way of dealing

01:17:32
with that thinking about uh

01:17:35
um raising productivity levels in

01:17:37
another way by investing in technology

01:17:39
etc etc and that has happened to some

01:17:42
extent but it hasn't been the answer uh

01:17:45
across the board I think the main

01:17:47
I would say Trend was to

01:17:50
keep a check on on the on the wages of

01:17:53
people so yeah that's when I when I talk

01:17:55
about Surplus is kind of more what kind

01:17:57
of wealth is created within the

01:17:59
capitalist system

01:18:01
rather than more in accountancy terms

01:18:04
what's the does the government run a

01:18:07
surplus or a benefit or or a deficit

01:18:10
um yeah just to be be clear there

01:18:14
um but yeah despite the fact that even

01:18:17
if there's the smaller budgets available

01:18:19
and so the allocation mechanism has

01:18:21
changed it has become less kind of

01:18:25
an element of how would I put this

01:18:28
managing

01:18:29
kind of growth across the territory it

01:18:32
has become more of a of a competition

01:18:34
really and you see for instance these

01:18:37
urban renewal projects as long as

01:18:38
there's a competition

01:18:40
to attract These funds to your city

01:18:44
um and that's yeah then you see that it

01:18:47
leads to some kind of uh Winner Takes a

01:18:49
doll phenomenon I mean Flemish

01:18:51
government is reflexive about that so

01:18:53
it's not extreme that it's all to one

01:18:55
city but still there's a tendency that

01:18:57
some cities benefit a bit more from that

01:18:59
than others that's

01:19:01
that's always dependence

01:19:05
um yeah

01:19:06
um I'm taking a lot of time then the the

01:19:09
next uh kind of final one and then we

01:19:12
kind of end the excurs and go back

01:19:15
um to the discussion about command and

01:19:18
control and world cities the kind of

01:19:20
final strategy is to make sure that in

01:19:24
the international division of labor in

01:19:26
these Global production networks and

01:19:27
Global Financial networks that you hold

01:19:29
these functions of command and control

01:19:32
and you can say there's a specific kind

01:19:34
of entrepreneurialism well you're invest

01:19:36
in physical connectivity digital

01:19:39
connectivity uh nowadays uh that you

01:19:43
invest in you could say supply side

01:19:45
economics I heard that a little bit uh

01:19:48
so state of the Arts uh districts

01:19:53
that are there to attract International

01:19:55
corporations and

01:19:57
development Central Business districts

01:19:59
that what I mean with that

01:20:01
also invest in educating the labor force

01:20:05
uh thinking about installing business

01:20:07
schools for instance in Frankfurt one of

01:20:09
the uh the leading Financial Center in

01:20:13
um in Germany

01:20:15
um due to University it has its business

01:20:18
school financed by Deutsche Bank right

01:20:20
so and there's lectures uh by people

01:20:23
working at Deutsche Bank

01:20:25
educating the new generation of critical

01:20:29
uh social scientists okay

01:20:32
um so this kind of a dynamic that's

01:20:34
particularly attaching itself to world

01:20:36
cities and the kind of idea is that if

01:20:39
you attract these Global functions it

01:20:41
will indeed set in motion some kind of a

01:20:44
trickle-down effect

01:20:46
it will inflate property prices because

01:20:49
they will as we have learned with Brad

01:20:51
Christophers they will become a part of

01:20:54
international portfolios

01:20:56
etc etc so that's kind of the strategy

01:21:00
that is set there

01:21:03
okay let's have a quick break uh five

01:21:06
minutes and then we actually get to the

01:21:08
polarization thesis which is taking a

01:21:11
lot of time today

01:21:17
a little bit yeah

01:21:25
thank you

01:21:28
okay

01:21:32
[Music]

01:21:33
uh yeah

01:21:36
um can I do the screen you can send me

01:21:39
an email

01:21:40
or maybe what I can do is just but I

01:21:43
want to avoid that kind of um

01:21:53
or you can just shout and say who is

01:21:56
bueno no no no no

01:21:59
[Music]

01:22:00
okay yeah I think they have that same

01:22:03
problem as far because I don't know who

01:22:05
is presenting with me this weekend I

01:22:07
don't have any ways

01:22:09
thank you ma'am yeah yeah yeah but

01:22:12
normally you can see it uh on canvas

01:22:16
yeah

01:22:18
okay and it's probably because

01:22:21
the people in the other group

01:22:24
uh I'll add email addresses

01:22:47
[Music]

01:23:09
[Music]

01:23:12
this is

01:23:20
foreign

01:23:38
[Music]

01:23:55
foreign

01:24:26
okay

01:24:36
[Music]

01:24:36
um

01:25:07
[Music]

01:25:23
um

01:25:47
[Music]

01:25:53
[Laughter]

01:25:56
um

01:26:27
because

01:26:33
it wasn't something yeah

01:27:07
[Music]

01:27:28
[Music]

01:27:42
foreign

01:27:59
[Music]

01:28:08
foreign

01:28:13
[Music]

01:28:36
okay let's reconvene

01:28:47
let's get started again

01:28:59
okay

01:29:02
so we have this brief excurs learning

01:29:06
about different entrepreneurial

01:29:08
strategies and I think what I wanted to

01:29:10
show is that

01:29:11
thank you there's there's a wide

01:29:14
restructuring of the economy and we can

01:29:16
place growing Global City formation

01:29:18
within that as one particular strategy

01:29:21
okay

01:29:22
or one particular process that is

01:29:25
explicitly relevant for world cities

01:29:28
now going back a little bit more to the

01:29:31
discussion about how does this connect

01:29:33
to polarization

01:29:35
well as we found there's this and it's

01:29:39
mostly Friedman and wolf Friedman and

01:29:41
system

01:29:42
uh the starting point was this

01:29:45
observation of a change in the economic

01:29:48
base generally a decline and well-paid

01:29:51
manufacturing jobs which is some kind of

01:29:54
an exodus because of globalization of

01:29:56
production

01:29:57
and at the same time a restructuring of

01:30:00
the economy uh towards services

01:30:05
as we've seen 80 percent of cities is

01:30:08
service based but it's both at the high

01:30:11
end and at the low end both formal

01:30:13
Services service markets and informal

01:30:16
service

01:30:18
so what kind of polarization thesis says

01:30:22
well there's something particular about

01:30:24
these commands and control functions

01:30:27
uh

01:30:28
fuels this polarization process please

01:30:31
take a seat

01:30:41
okay

01:30:45
[Music]

01:30:48
please do a refill

01:30:53
so there's something particular about

01:30:55
these APS and headquarters economies

01:30:58
that will set a motion polarization

01:31:01
process okay

01:31:03
so at one point there's you could say

01:31:05
competition within the APN APS complex

01:31:08
itself which will lead to

01:31:11
an idea of Outsourcing getting rid of

01:31:13
some kind of non-core activities

01:31:16
quite often this leads to low-key kind

01:31:20
of activities that are all and a lot of

01:31:24
contexts also linked to some form of

01:31:26
informal economy

01:31:28
and a lot of kind of Migrant labor that

01:31:31
takes care of routine service charts

01:31:34
think about cleaning functions think

01:31:37
about

01:31:38
um well the Xerox machine and those kind

01:31:41
of things clerical work etc etc

01:31:45
next to that what you also see is that

01:31:48
with these high-end functions or these

01:31:51
command and control functions

01:31:53
it comes with uh the influx of

01:31:56
wealth salaries people that have a lot

01:31:59
of spending power that have their own

01:32:02
desire for certain forms of of housing

01:32:05
quite often the sets in motion bursts of

01:32:08
gentrification so the displacement of

01:32:11
initial populations

01:32:14
um and it's also at the level of

01:32:15
consumption Goods of of leisure

01:32:18
activities that this leads to a

01:32:20
transformation okay so if you host these

01:32:22
activities well basically the managers

01:32:24
the CEOs people in Business Services

01:32:27
Advanced producer Services well they

01:32:30
have the whole Ecology of cultural

01:32:31
amenities and hurricane Etc uh so

01:32:35
there's this also creates some kind of

01:32:37
demand for

01:32:39
um low-income jobs to cater quite

01:32:43
literally to these uh Elites there is

01:32:46
something particular about world cities

01:32:49
which makes that there will be a even

01:32:52
more augmented process of polarization

01:32:55
compared to non-world cities or

01:32:59
um

01:33:00
or wider territories okay and the end

01:33:03
result the ideas is that you get with

01:33:06
you get a a different structure or

01:33:09
income distribution in the sense that

01:33:11
there's a lot of growth of jobs at the

01:33:14
very top there's a growth of jobs at the

01:33:17
at the bottom of the income distribution

01:33:19
and in general because of a decline in

01:33:23
well-paid well remunerated stable

01:33:25
manufacturing jobs there's a kind of a

01:33:28
decrease of middle income groups and you

01:33:30
end up with an hour class okay so

01:33:33
something like that okay

01:33:36
um that when this kind of figure shows

01:33:39
how that works

01:33:40
it's a bit hard to decipher here but

01:33:44
there's the growth of M which is kind of

01:33:47
uh managerial class so CEOs of

01:33:51
international corporations link to that

01:33:54
is p these are kind of the producer

01:33:57
services or the advanced business

01:33:58
services that we've been talking about

01:34:00
and then below that see these are all

01:34:02
kinds of clarable tasks okay

01:34:05
menu tasks and kind of taking care of

01:34:09
administrations

01:34:11
Etc in the current day and age these

01:34:14
activities are also kind of being

01:34:15
globalized and offshores and of

01:34:18
themselves the 1980s there these back

01:34:20
office Works still took place in global

01:34:23
cities okay

01:34:24
so at the same time you see a growth you

01:34:28
could say an informal markets or

01:34:30
informal parts of the economy

01:34:34
um

01:34:34
and these are often also based on

01:34:38
um on migrantly okay

01:34:41
um

01:34:42
for instance what we have here I mean

01:34:45
all these kind of amenities that we were

01:34:47
talking about hurricane

01:34:49
letter activities is kind of supported

01:34:52
by that uh there's in informal

01:34:55
production facilities that are

01:34:57
re-emerging in cities and then yeah

01:35:01
consumption rules and other kinds of

01:35:03
things that are also kind of emerging

01:35:06
there in connection to

01:35:09
um the rise of this APS complex and

01:35:11
Global Corporation so in general what

01:35:14
you need to remember is you have an

01:35:16
exodus of these high-wage manufacturing

01:35:20
jobs that's what kind of is the main the

01:35:22
restructuring and the kind of influx of

01:35:25
workers

01:35:27
um often from uh from a global scale of

01:35:30
foreign migrant workers that quite often

01:35:33
end up in uh in informal labor markets

01:35:36
and note that I still have this one if

01:35:39
you don't mind how

01:35:41
big okay so a general restructure of

01:35:43
this labor market and importantly and

01:35:46
what sets

01:35:47
um women Global cities apart from you

01:35:50
could say the rest of the territory or

01:35:52
small cities is that this labor market

01:35:54
becomes globalized

01:35:56
and it speaks because I have both sides

01:35:59
of uh this hourglass it works at the at

01:36:02
the top level we have the uh the high

01:36:05
paid

01:36:06
um migrants and it works also at the

01:36:09
lower end of the income distribution

01:36:12
and quite interestingly

01:36:15
uh sometimes quite cynically there's

01:36:18
um also different terminologies for that

01:36:20
so people at the high end uh it doesn't

01:36:23
really matter uh or they're kind of not

01:36:26
seen as immigrants but these are expats

01:36:28
quite often for instance in Belgium they

01:36:31
enjoy quite interesting text regimes

01:36:33
with the discussion as to whether it

01:36:36
would be a nice idea to actually tax

01:36:38
expats in Belgium

01:36:41
um so these are kind of seen as people

01:36:43
that

01:36:45
um

01:36:45
that bring in a lot of expertise a lot

01:36:48
of value that make a city very

01:36:50
competitive uh in this global war for

01:36:54
talent whereas uh people that are more

01:36:58
at in the lower paid jobs are seen as as

01:37:01
immigrants right uh or foreigners etc

01:37:05
etc Okay so

01:37:07
there's a lot of terms of being used

01:37:09
there that are

01:37:10
take part of a very performative and

01:37:13
normalizing

01:37:16
um and normalizing the situation so the

01:37:18
way we talk about these divisions

01:37:21
matters I think

01:37:24
um

01:37:24
so what we see is

01:37:26
um uh also

01:37:28
growth of of low-skilled

01:37:32
or these skilled uh migrant workers

01:37:37
um so are the people that have little

01:37:40
qualification in a country of origin and

01:37:43
and come to a world of global City

01:37:47
or people that have qualifications

01:37:49
but

01:37:51
for some reason because they cross the

01:37:53
border have lost proof of that okay so a

01:37:57
lot of contacts even if you eradicated

01:37:59
in one or one in the other direction

01:38:02
uh you have to kind of be accredited for

01:38:05
that right so you have to uh your

01:38:07
diploma needs to be certified to be able

01:38:10
to access the labor market in one way or

01:38:12
another

01:38:13
this in and of itself is quite an

01:38:15
interesting process uh but it means that

01:38:18
a lot of people especially in informal

01:38:20
uh relative informal migration

01:38:24
may not be in the position to actually

01:38:25
do that so they may have all kinds of

01:38:27
skills but they can't formally use them

01:38:29
okay so this is a kind of process of

01:38:32
descaling that is that is going on now

01:38:34
what it creates especially in a place

01:38:36
where you have a lot of immigration and

01:38:39
that's that's typically World in global

01:38:41
cities it just creates a very large pool

01:38:44
of people that have a very poor

01:38:48
um

01:38:49
uh you could say that are that are not

01:38:51
really empowered that that don't have a

01:38:54
bargain power to negotiate a better

01:38:56
wages

01:38:57
um and if they don't do it well somebody

01:39:00
else will and that's kind of the the

01:39:02
notion of a reserve Army of Labor

01:39:04
a lot of people that are in flux debt

01:39:07
will basically take any job

01:39:11
and you see in that case you see the

01:39:13
emergence of what people call 3D jobs

01:39:16
dirty demanding and dangerous or dirty

01:39:19
dangerous and difficult uh a lot of

01:39:21
Migrant labor in Roman Global cities

01:39:24
ends up in uh these kind of segments

01:39:29
and these are typically jobs that people

01:39:32
um that kind of the natives if you will

01:39:35
are unwilling to do

01:39:39
and I mean for instance if you look at

01:39:41
the whole debate about the fella Fallout

01:39:44
of brexit

01:39:46
and it had been driven tremendously by

01:39:49
anti-immigrant they are stealing our

01:39:52
jobs sentiment uh and now they're the

01:39:56
economy is kind of crippled

01:39:58
by uh not having access to fuel because

01:40:02
there's no truck drivers to actually uh

01:40:05
or migrant truck drives to actually

01:40:07
bring the fuel to to pump stations gas

01:40:10
stations so you can refill your car so

01:40:13
it's kind of

01:40:14
uh history with the Vengeance there

01:40:18
um and it kind of shows The crucial

01:40:20
dependence of our economy a lot of

01:40:22
cities

01:40:23
in that migrant labor and a lot of

01:40:26
essential services that is absolutely

01:40:29
undervalued in societal terms

01:40:33
um

01:40:34
yeah and then

01:40:36
what what is actually uh quite

01:40:39
interesting to see and that's also work

01:40:41
by Sasuke assassin when she was still

01:40:43
married hence group

01:40:46
um that yeah

01:40:49
a lot of these activities are informal

01:40:52
are connected to floating populations

01:40:54
people that are residing temporarily in

01:40:58
cities

01:41:00
um that may be transmigrants uh move on

01:41:03
one way or another

01:41:05
and yeah they they form the context of

01:41:10
you could say potential exploitation

01:41:12
it's not necessarily happening but it's

01:41:13
kind of a context where people that want

01:41:16
to take advantage

01:41:18
um Can more easily do that okay

01:41:22
um it can be

01:41:24
sometimes for very good reasons to say

01:41:26
Okay I want to help somebody

01:41:28
and I'll let you clean my house or take

01:41:33
care of the children and I'll pay you

01:41:35
the minimum wage or something like that

01:41:37
[Music]

01:41:38
right that could be the position of a

01:41:41
middle-class family uh in in a global

01:41:44
City but at the same time there's this

01:41:46
structural discrimination of these

01:41:49
groups in society they may be well

01:41:52
suited to take other jobs at Society but

01:41:55
yeah they're kind of forced into them so

01:41:57
it's kind of in combination with a large

01:42:00
group of people that are looking for

01:42:01
jobs

01:42:03
um the informal character allows a lot

01:42:06
of

01:42:07
um informal uh potential forms of of

01:42:10
exploitation and this is what substance

01:42:12
calls the peripheralization at the core

01:42:15
so what she says is that typically we

01:42:18
think about exploitation as a relation

01:42:20
between say the global North or the

01:42:22
global South well actually it's taking

01:42:24
place it re-enters the global North so

01:42:27
in world and Global cities you can also

01:42:30
find this

01:42:32
um these exploitative relations because

01:42:35
the global South is actually

01:42:38
living

01:42:39
in world and Global cities whereas the

01:42:43
relation

01:42:44
remains exported okay so

01:42:47
peripheralization of the Court just in

01:42:49
figures to to illustrate this is to

01:42:53
referred a little bit to the research on

01:42:54
this so there's a whole strand of

01:42:57
research looking into urban belief

01:43:00
Networks

01:43:02
some kind of interesting work by uh

01:43:04
William Carroll looking at Interlocking

01:43:06
directorates it's it's one way of

01:43:09
measuring

01:43:11
um you could say the connections between

01:43:13
cities

01:43:15
um

01:43:15
by looking at the the overlaps between

01:43:19
the board of directors of Corporation so

01:43:23
one one member of the board sitting on

01:43:28
different boards so for instance

01:43:31
uh 40 spunk Belgium and BNB buddy bar uh

01:43:36
Paris or something like that and we see

01:43:39
actually in this picture there's quite a

01:43:41
strong connection between Brussels and

01:43:43
Paris but it shows that

01:43:45
yeah uh as we we live in a kind of

01:43:48
global economy as for the corporate

01:43:51
world has globalized there's also you

01:43:54
could say the social structure there

01:43:55
behind that of a traveling Global Elite

01:43:58
with a lot of power decision making

01:44:00
power that is connecting this kind of

01:44:03
place okay so if you're board of

01:44:06
directors of uh and the board of

01:44:08
directors of 10 or 15 corporations well

01:44:11
you will be

01:44:12
you say traveling around in first class

01:44:16
uh between these places

01:44:19
uh and and go from Citadel to Citadel if

01:44:23
you will okay

01:44:25
um I also did a little bit of research

01:44:26
into how this looks and Islamic markets

01:44:29
and I found actually quite similar

01:44:31
things the geographies look different

01:44:34
um but um what out of that is how

01:44:37
governance structures work in Islamic

01:44:40
Banks and there you find that next to

01:44:43
the typical board of directors you also

01:44:45
have a Sharia board and these these

01:44:48
boards basically review to what extent

01:44:51
the activities of banks are

01:44:53
in line with the Sharia okay so are they

01:44:57
um hello or are they not considered uh

01:45:01
Allah

01:45:04
uh yeah it's it's very similar to what I

01:45:06
found in uh on the previous figure in

01:45:09
the sense that it's also very

01:45:10
concentrated uh uh social geography so

01:45:14
it's very concentrated in a very limited

01:45:16
set of Scholars

01:45:19
um some of them sit on the board 50

01:45:21
different corporations

01:45:24
um which creates all kinds of

01:45:26
interesting things as to to what extent

01:45:28
is this so credible that they will

01:45:31
review uh the Sharia compliant character

01:45:34
or other things going on

01:45:36
uh you see there's a connection with New

01:45:38
York

01:45:39
um well at some point golden Sachs uh

01:45:43
also was planning to to go into Islamic

01:45:46
markets and there was a whole

01:45:47
controversy uh as to what extents

01:45:51
um their financial products

01:45:53
was actually

01:45:55
um reviewed by by Sharia scholas or

01:45:59
whether this was some kind of reviews

01:46:01
etc etc there was a huge Flashback by

01:46:04
um

01:46:06
scores by this entire community and uh

01:46:10
in the end it didn't materialize but

01:46:12
just to show you that there's different

01:46:15
ways of approaching these Urban lead

01:46:16
networks but it's it's the existence of

01:46:19
those kind of structures that allows us

01:46:21
to understand yeah what kind of

01:46:23
activities take place at that level and

01:46:26
how do you can affect uh say income

01:46:29
structures because they they're

01:46:30
extremely well remunerated and will

01:46:33
reside in different kind of places

01:46:36
now at the other end what I was talking

01:46:39
about is this these new forms of

01:46:41
industrial

01:46:43
um

01:46:43
exploitation uh in these sweatshops

01:46:48
um

01:46:49
so yeah what are these kind of

01:46:51
sweatshops you may have heard of that

01:46:52
it's kind of the Renaissance of very old

01:46:55
forms of exploitation or industrial

01:46:58
organization you may have heard about in

01:47:00
the middle age Middle Ages you had to

01:47:03
put it out system where people in the

01:47:05
household and were in the countryside

01:47:07
were actually producing uh at the piece

01:47:11
by piece salary uh textiles for uh for

01:47:16
capitalists and cities

01:47:18
um it's kind of reinvented in the 20th

01:47:21
and 21st century and so flat shops are

01:47:24
these small units usually underground uh

01:47:27
or in secluded spaces often in the

01:47:30
textile industry

01:47:31
uh that works through all these kind of

01:47:34
sub subcontracting uh deals so you never

01:47:37
quite know who is really hiring people

01:47:40
so there's different kind of layers of

01:47:42
of governance there uh a lot of people

01:47:45
yeah are indeed paid by the piece or

01:47:48
have daily or weekly contracts uh which

01:47:52
yeah it's extremely precarious as you

01:47:55
may understand

01:47:57
um and yeah we see that it's kind of

01:48:00
re-emerging and it was say the 19th

01:48:03
century

01:48:04
um it took place in a lot of

01:48:07
industrializing cities

01:48:09
it's went away and for instance in the

01:48:12
U.S you see that because there was all

01:48:16
kind of yeah the trade unions

01:48:19
um initiatives

01:48:20
uh regulations were adapted for instance

01:48:24
in relation to the to the New Deal

01:48:27
um just before uh the Second World War

01:48:30
which made this practically impossible

01:48:34
so it was in a context where you had far

01:48:37
less migrant labor but actually possible

01:48:39
to regulate those markets

01:48:42
but that's kind of returned to the 1990s

01:48:45
this kind of all of a sudden is back at

01:48:48
these are very old data but in the 1990s

01:48:51
uh calculated I think between four

01:48:54
thousand five hundred and four thousand

01:48:55
five hundred of seven thousand textile

01:48:58
companies there and then in New York

01:49:00
were actually sweatshops okay so when

01:49:03
you think about world city formation

01:49:04
it's not just

01:49:07
um these Glitz and Glam offices with

01:49:10
bankers at the same time it's very old

01:49:13
forms of exploitation that are made

01:49:15
possible by a complete

01:49:17
absence of any labor rights uh

01:49:21
protection

01:49:23
so yeah uh the places in Chinatown of

01:49:27
the lower lower east and yeah is this

01:49:30
kind of situations are still occurring

01:49:33
there okay

01:49:36
now then to turn a little bit to

01:49:40
um I would say criticism or critiques of

01:49:42
the polarization pieces because it seems

01:49:45
to be a very kind of elegant thesis

01:49:47
right as the the restructuring of the

01:49:50
economy at the same time there's a

01:49:52
globalization it leads to attraction of

01:49:55
headquarters and APS functions and this

01:49:57
kind of adds to a wider process of

01:50:00
income and rational polarization which

01:50:02
then may also lead to social spatial

01:50:05
polarization okay because people with

01:50:06
different kind of income groups may not

01:50:08
necessarily live in the same place quite

01:50:11
on the contrary if they have very

01:50:13
different Lifestyles they may want to

01:50:14
live something else

01:50:16
same time also the empirical base is

01:50:19
mostly linked to a limited set of of

01:50:22
cases New York London Tokyo so

01:50:25
especially in the 1990s when

01:50:28
this became a major debate the question

01:50:31
is is Susan right uh or is something

01:50:36
wrong to put it in the words of Chris

01:50:38
Hamlet who is also one of one of you say

01:50:41
the main counter voices in this debate

01:50:43
so for instance according to to hamnet

01:50:46
yeah he's very critical of this term

01:50:48
polarization as we also briefly

01:50:50
discussed before

01:50:52
he says well it's an all-purpose General

01:50:54
signifier

01:50:56
and in the end yeah it doesn't really

01:51:00
explain much and we don't

01:51:02
necessarily neatly describe what is

01:51:04
going on in particular world cities

01:51:07
so what it says is that next to

01:51:10
polarization

01:51:11
this other process is thinking thinkable

01:51:14
right we can think about

01:51:16
proletarianization so that's the

01:51:18
emergence of say

01:51:20
an exploited underclass if you will to

01:51:24
use that term in society as the main

01:51:27
Trend or it could also be

01:51:28
professionalization which somehow refers

01:51:31
to social Mobility

01:51:34
um the rise of middle income jobs etc

01:51:37
etc so instead of assuming that world

01:51:39
and Global City formation necessarily

01:51:42
produces polarization it's actually a

01:51:45
research question empirical question

01:51:47
what is going on uh in cities Okay so

01:51:51
rather than just saying okay uh this is

01:51:54
a piece or or a given fact it may be a

01:51:59
hypothesis to see to what extent we see

01:52:02
evidence of polarization or where do we

01:52:04
see other things happening and one way

01:52:06
of doing that is also taking more into

01:52:08
account the occupational structure and

01:52:11
the spatial structure of cities

01:52:15
so to tell a bit more about this

01:52:17
occupational structure uh what it talks

01:52:21
about Chris hamnet and this is kind of

01:52:23
an interesting evolution in the 1990s uh

01:52:27
he mostly looked at the case of London

01:52:30
uh and he says well

01:52:33
what we find in New York

01:52:35
are not necessarily necessarily find

01:52:37
that in the case of London there's

01:52:40
actually very little polarization what I

01:52:43
find is professionalization okay

01:52:45
so yes there's a growth of high income

01:52:48
jobs

01:52:49
but it's not necessarily linked to an

01:52:52
explosion of jobs at the bottom so it's

01:52:56
it's not really an hourglass at the same

01:52:59
time we also see evidence of a growth in

01:53:02
Middle income jobs

01:53:04
and a lot of people

01:53:06
can make can move up you could say the

01:53:10
occupational structure can be trained uh

01:53:14
it can get a training

01:53:18
um and are professionalizing

01:53:22
um so yeah he doesn't find the pattern

01:53:24
of of what what was assumed to be the

01:53:28
the two expected pattern of New York at

01:53:32
the same time he says well it could be

01:53:33
related to the fact that migration is

01:53:38
there and then far less the case

01:53:41
um it's also uncomparable to uh what you

01:53:45
find in New York so you had migration

01:53:48
obviously uh to London but it was less

01:53:51
globalized it was mostly linked you

01:53:54
could say too

01:53:55
the remnants of Empire but it wasn't of

01:53:59
the scale of what you found in New York

01:54:02
and so he says yeah there's also a much

01:54:05
more generous welfare state

01:54:08
when you compare it to what you had in

01:54:11
New York so

01:54:12
no this is okay let's not exaggerate we

01:54:15
don't really fight polarization other

01:54:17
pathways are actually thinkable

01:54:22
um and then

01:54:24
what we actually uh kind of find them in

01:54:27
such context is that

01:54:29
um

01:54:30
it might be something that's kind of

01:54:32
more intersects with

01:54:34
um

01:54:35
you could say uh process of privilege

01:54:39
that intersects with gender roles in uh

01:54:43
and society and this benefit so it's

01:54:45
it's less uh the whole discussion about

01:54:49
yes does this APS complex that that

01:54:52
start to transform the entire labor

01:54:54
market now it's actually wider

01:54:56
dimensions of of uh gender and ethnicity

01:55:00
which is in society that will explain

01:55:03
what we find in labor markets so for

01:55:05
instance Joy by Susan uh Feinstein

01:55:08
and colleagues they they look at uh the

01:55:12
exclusion uh by female labor in high-end

01:55:16
jobs or for instance the work by uh by

01:55:19
John Wills

01:55:21
um no John May and colleagues I forgot

01:55:23
what the first name of the co-water is

01:55:27
is to say okay look we have to look much

01:55:32
more at ethnicity to understand what is

01:55:34
going on because

01:55:36
um for instance one third of of London's

01:55:38
Filipino population is actually in

01:55:41
Health and Social care Brazilians are in

01:55:44
cleaning services uh

01:55:46
sick are are hired as as security guards

01:55:53
algerians are running

01:55:55
um the Metro System etc etc okay so

01:55:59
these kind of more General processes

01:56:01
will tell us much more about what is

01:56:04
going on

01:56:06
what we find is that when you start

01:56:08
looking at more recent work at London

01:56:10
is that yeah this whole argument that

01:56:14
that longness somehow excluded or

01:56:16
protected from processes of polarization

01:56:20
doesn't really seem to hold yeah there's

01:56:24
a question

01:56:25
uh

01:56:40
yeah like a shadow economy or something

01:56:43
yeah I think that's one of the reasons

01:56:46
uh that's a very good point and I think

01:56:49
that's one of the differences between

01:56:51
for instance the work of John May and

01:56:53
colleagues and the conclusions by Chris

01:56:58
Hamner who is focusing on formal

01:57:01
occupational structures

01:57:02
so indeed that's the first point

01:57:05
methodological question is there's

01:57:07
basically a result of the data that is

01:57:09
being used

01:57:11
and actually what you find is that uh in

01:57:15
the article that was in the reader which

01:57:16
is a way more recent one he also admits

01:57:20
that process of polarization are going

01:57:23
on in London okay so it's kind of um he

01:57:27
has seen the light Chris Hamlet and

01:57:31
that's kind of yeah just referring to

01:57:33
this paper is kind of I find a very

01:57:35
interesting paper because it really

01:57:36
targets uh migrant groups here in the

01:57:40
sense that they look at at remuneration

01:57:43
and the kind of jobs that are being done

01:57:46
by people that typically are not part of

01:57:49
visual statistics

01:57:51
um

01:57:52
and yeah it's kind of it's kind of hard

01:57:56
to draw conclusions from that and say

01:57:57
okay uh for instance if you look at this

01:57:59
picture yeah this kind of showing the

01:58:02
the division across different kind of uh

01:58:05
rage groups so they they yeah collected

01:58:10
responses by over 300

01:58:14
uh uh people in informal markets

01:58:19
um

01:58:20
yeah you find that only nine percent

01:58:22
actually uh earns the living wage right

01:58:26
so it's it's

01:58:28
it really shows that there's an overlay

01:58:31
between the migrant labor and poor

01:58:35
working conditions but at the same time

01:58:37
it doesn't give you an overview of the

01:58:40
entire structure of the labor market so

01:58:42
it's kind of a yeah it can't draw

01:58:44
systemic conclusions from that but if

01:58:46
you for instance compare it to this kind

01:58:47
of picture which is not about income but

01:58:50
there's about

01:58:52
uh job quality so it's a very rough

01:58:55
marker of you could say yeah where in

01:58:59
the say social hierarchy or occupational

01:59:01
hierarchy are we at

01:59:03
there you see that there's actually a

01:59:05
growth at uh in the kind of the the

01:59:08
shooting jobs if you will

01:59:11
um a stagnation will be prime of normal

01:59:15
decent jobs and a large growth at the at

01:59:18
the top okay so and these kind of

01:59:20
indicators that that they would

01:59:22
occupational structure it's counter

01:59:24
evidence towards professionalization so

01:59:27
I think what happens here is that

01:59:30
when Chris Hammond was writing his his

01:59:34
argument against Susan in the 1990s it

01:59:37
may have still been true

01:59:39
it may be have been biased by looking at

01:59:43
formal statistics not capturing what was

01:59:47
going on at the bottom because it was

01:59:50
basically part of the informal economy

01:59:51
but then even with that

01:59:54
as time has passed the picture uh even

01:59:58
in the formal Market would would no

02:00:00
longer look as he would have described

02:00:01
it so it's kind of a process of of

02:00:04
restructuring that has um that has only

02:00:06
been initiated later I think compared to

02:00:09
to report

02:00:11
okay but in any case I think

02:00:15
um it's also not necessarily the points

02:00:17
uh to say okay assassin is right or uh

02:00:22
or Hamlet is wrong point is that we have

02:00:25
to

02:00:26
identify different process that can

02:00:29
actually take place at the same time so

02:00:30
you can imagine ant polarization and

02:00:33
professionalization at the same time

02:00:35
it's not because you see polarization

02:00:38
that some

02:00:40
segments of the population actually

02:00:41
undergo social Mobility uh in fact it

02:00:45
could actually be quite an interesting

02:00:46
question in the context of

02:00:48
polarization who is still able to

02:00:50
improve oneself on the labor market and

02:00:53
who is who is not so it's kind I think

02:00:55
that for me was kind of the gist of of

02:00:57
the article uh by Chris Hamlet's uh

02:01:00
there

02:01:02
okay let me move on because uh again

02:01:04
running out of time

02:01:07
um so yeah looking more closely at the

02:01:09
occupational structure I I can't

02:01:11
possibly go beyond that but it gives you

02:01:15
a hint of what to look for the second

02:01:17
element is spatial structure right so a

02:01:21
very important critique Prince by Susan

02:01:22
Feinstein is uh to what extent are the

02:01:28
result of polarization is also a

02:01:30
statistical artifact and there's a lot

02:01:32
of focus on on cities

02:01:36
but we at the same time we know that

02:01:39
middle classes have been suburbanizing

02:01:41
or are still suburbanizing so maybe this

02:01:45
whole disappearance of middle-income

02:01:48
jobs from cities and the fact that you

02:01:50
end up with a very polarized labor

02:01:52
market it could be some kind of an

02:01:54
artifact

02:01:56
um so yeah I think that's something to

02:01:58
to take into account that's also why

02:02:01
it's interesting to compare you could

02:02:03
say differences between what we did in

02:02:06
New York State versus New York City I

02:02:09
think you can't say that there's no

02:02:11
General Trend in kind of a decline of

02:02:14
middle income jobs for instance in the

02:02:16
case of of the US

02:02:19
um but it's perhaps less accentuated

02:02:21
than if you only look at at a very neat

02:02:24
uh City Center okay so there's always an

02:02:26
a possibility that wealth is

02:02:28
suburbanized and would give you a

02:02:30
different question so

02:02:32
scale matters space matters in the sense

02:02:34
that you have to be aware that you need

02:02:37
to kind of map the appropriate

02:02:40
metropolitan area to to understand the

02:02:43
entire structure of the labor market

02:02:45
okay

02:02:46
no yeah and everything can go many ways

02:02:49
and sense that you also have to be

02:02:50
sensitive to what extents

02:02:52
um

02:02:53
uh you could say these higher incomes

02:02:56
will drive gentrification there has been

02:02:58
a whole process of moving out of cities

02:03:01
uh but there's also been a return to the

02:03:04
city when you take a city like Brussels

02:03:06
I think I would say it's around a few

02:03:09
thousand there has been a return of

02:03:11
middle incomes and a lot of places

02:03:13
really leading world cities has been

02:03:16
returned of the super rich

02:03:18
uh setting in motion motion process of

02:03:21
what Loretta Lee Schools super

02:03:23
gentrification in just one example of

02:03:26
that is and I refer to that on the map

02:03:28
uh Brooklyn

02:03:30
used to be you could say uh a nice uh

02:03:33
suburb uh off of New York just across uh

02:03:38
the river which was still affordable and

02:03:41
you could deliver these Brown stones but

02:03:43
what she described is

02:03:44
how actually the the top uh earners in

02:03:51
New York are increasing we're

02:03:53
increasingly buying in uh in these

02:03:55
property markets so we see that almost

02:03:57
half of

02:03:59
um of all Brooklyn was owned by the top

02:04:02
10 okay and that in that period you see

02:04:06
a tremendous growth in or inflation of

02:04:09
property values in that period so you

02:04:12
really have to look at the detailed

02:04:14
level uh within a city how uh you can

02:04:17
say these higher incomes

02:04:19
yeah what kind of spatial process they

02:04:22
set in motion and sometimes at least a

02:04:25
gentrification of inner city

02:04:26
neighborhoods it may be more peripheral

02:04:28
processes etc etc so there's no Unified

02:04:31
spatial structure there it's just a

02:04:34
question if we have a restructure of the

02:04:37
economy

02:04:38
where does it spatially attaches itself

02:04:40
okay

02:04:42
another example is for instance Brussels

02:04:45
where we find that let's say voltage

02:04:49
information and process often

02:04:52
europeanization of the economy and all

02:04:54
kind of functions that are linked to

02:04:56
that how it has kind of reinforced

02:04:58
existing social spatial divides and this

02:05:01
is worked by uh now admitted to a

02:05:04
professor from KU live and discussed a

02:05:07
lot

02:05:08
uh who looked at

02:05:11
um at the evolution of you could say

02:05:14
migrants populations and expat

02:05:17
populations sorry for that divide again

02:05:19
but it's it's being used in reality

02:05:23
um in in Brussels and what you see is

02:05:25
that

02:05:26
um

02:05:27
uh you could say typically the

02:05:29
population with with a lower income

02:05:32
um the Moroccan population has has grown

02:05:35
in the western partner western part of

02:05:38
the city

02:05:44
and the poor Crescent which is kind of

02:05:48
the leading imaginary there also with

02:05:50
policy makers uh whereas you could say

02:05:53
europeanization has attracted a lot of

02:05:56
expats uh mostly Americans and other

02:06:00
kind of um

02:06:02
people from the European Union mostly

02:06:05
settled in the Southeastern part of

02:06:09
um of Brussels and what Chris castellope

02:06:12
explains is that in this geography it's

02:06:16
kind of reproducing earlier rounds of

02:06:18
division in Brussels

02:06:22
um it's kind of no coincidence that

02:06:25
people with a Moroccan uh ethnicity end

02:06:28
up in the Northwest it has something to

02:06:31
do with the wider process of of Migrant

02:06:33
labor guest Labor uh from the 1950s and

02:06:37
60s

02:06:38
I can say a lot about that but the

02:06:40
bottom line is Belgian government

02:06:42
actually uh went to Morocco but also

02:06:45
Turkey Greece Italy to

02:06:49
um to really

02:06:50
you could say brand Belgium as the place

02:06:53
to work

02:06:55
um a lot of of Migrant Services broader

02:06:57
families they were seen as temporary

02:07:00
guest workers and the empties people

02:07:02
decided yes we were going to build a

02:07:04
family here

02:07:06
uh and he actually well uh worked in all

02:07:08
kinds of productive activities in

02:07:10
Brussels

02:07:11
who with the crisis of the 1960s 70s

02:07:15
uh ended so the the you could say

02:07:18
globalization of production also had a

02:07:20
huge impact on these kind of jobs so a

02:07:24
lot of these migrant workers

02:07:26
were faced with structural unemployment

02:07:28
and were kind of locked in into these

02:07:30
situations uh and yeah never really got

02:07:34
out of there okay so there's there's

02:07:37
still

02:07:38
um

02:07:39
uh provides unemployment rates

02:07:42
um and what we find is that with the

02:07:46
restructuring of the economy just at the

02:07:49
time when new kind of jobs were being

02:07:50
created there were the jobs that were

02:07:53
not really matching the the profile of

02:07:56
these guest workers so there was a lot

02:07:57
of of service work

02:08:00
um and yeah I mean it required training

02:08:03
which was not necessarily offered to

02:08:06
make that transition within one

02:08:08
generation so

02:08:09
that's why you kind of see this this

02:08:12
kind of pattern uh reproduce so the

02:08:15
argument by Chris gas float is that we

02:08:17
should really uh look also into

02:08:19
um

02:08:20
looking at the continuities uh in these

02:08:23
spatial structures you for instance also

02:08:25
find that

02:08:27
um in in contemporary Elite geographies

02:08:30
and kind of continuing a little bit the

02:08:32
work by Chris Castle but then focusing

02:08:34
on say the the upper stratum if you will

02:08:38
uh we looked at cultural patronage

02:08:40
activities which is basically

02:08:43
a method to identify people with a lot

02:08:47
of money or that think about themselves

02:08:49
as being distinct by consuming high-end

02:08:52
cultural activity so we basically went

02:08:54
to uh La moner

02:08:58
um

02:09:01
uh what is it again uh Elizabeth

02:09:06
so you have all kinds of highbrow

02:09:08
cultural activities uh in Brussels

02:09:11
taking place we also went to Bazaar we

02:09:14
tried to identify who is actually on the

02:09:16
big friend list uh who is sponsoring

02:09:20
these uh high-end cultural institutions

02:09:22
I mean these fees are not kind of super

02:09:25
spectacular I think sometimes we find

02:09:28
it's kind of you become a big fan of

02:09:30
bizarre I think it was 12 500 euros per

02:09:33
year so it's not kind of Jeff Jeff Bezos

02:09:36
but at the same time it's not something

02:09:38
that you could spend on a normal salary

02:09:41
so you that was kind of used as a as a

02:09:44
kind of Criterion to kind of find a

02:09:47
group that that has both you could say

02:09:49
cultural capital uh and also economic

02:09:52
what we found then is that and that was

02:09:54
actually quite interesting that the two

02:09:56
these kind of methods you could actually

02:09:58
identify where these people live and we

02:10:01
actually I mean boss and I uh took our

02:10:04
pipes and went taken pictures uh I could

02:10:07
actually uh at the plot level identify

02:10:11
where where Elites were living

02:10:13
do you find kind of interesting

02:10:15
clusterings there

02:10:16
and it's all very much concentrated in

02:10:19
and actually in a city neighborhood so

02:10:21
most of the kind of Roads led to uh to

02:10:24
this kind of area around

02:10:27
and those kind of areas so we identified

02:10:31
that our Elites are very Urban if you

02:10:34
will and the other place was kind of

02:10:36
more uh Suburban but still within the

02:10:40
Russell's Capital Region with spookular

02:10:42
which is more like villain neighborhood

02:10:46
um

02:10:47
uh so it's kind of a distinct uh way of

02:10:50
life but it's kind of interesting that

02:10:52
the the major we could say segregation

02:10:54
process that you find in terms of gated

02:10:57
communities those kind of things this is

02:11:00
not something that you

02:11:02
easily find in Brussels these things

02:11:04
exist in Brussels but it's not

02:11:06
yeah it's not the Sao Paulo or Rio de

02:11:10
Janeiro or this kind of thing so it's

02:11:13
really

02:11:14
um Happening by micro mechanisms at the

02:11:17
Block Level that is kind of segregation

02:11:19
is is going on

02:11:22
no just those were just a few examples

02:11:25
to take into account uh histories of

02:11:29
spatial structure that may matter

02:11:32
now drawing into a close I think what I

02:11:34
want to say is that yeah how to explain

02:11:39
um we could say inequality polarization

02:11:42
etc etc I think we've learned that

02:11:43
polarization it's just one way of one

02:11:45
outcome of this process is we need some

02:11:49
kind of an analytical or explanatory

02:11:51
model for that

02:11:52
Hannah and I want to draw on birds and

02:11:55
mustard here and I find it's still quite

02:11:58
interesting because they they're working

02:11:59
kind of three ways they said look

02:12:01
there's at the macro level a level of

02:12:04
global change the economy in general is

02:12:06
restructuring it could be financializing

02:12:08
this uh new international division of

02:12:11
labor etc etc so that's happening at the

02:12:14
macro level there's also at the

02:12:15
individual level

02:12:17
due to personal characteristics choices

02:12:20
Etc

02:12:21
patterns habits cultures you may uh have

02:12:24
different kind of Labor Market

02:12:25
opportunities

02:12:27
um there's a lot of noise there it's

02:12:30
hard to study

02:12:31
um in a systematic way but we need to

02:12:34
acknowledge that but what is kind of

02:12:36
interesting is how the micro and the

02:12:37
micro kind of connected by this medium

02:12:40
level level of analysis

02:12:42
because it's kind of the interface

02:12:44
between Global process and local process

02:12:46
so we can think about how ethnicity

02:12:49
gender and those kind of things will

02:12:51
structure access to the labor market and

02:12:54
positionality in the labor market as

02:12:56
that labor market is being restructured

02:12:58
we have to acknowledge National

02:13:00
differences

02:13:02
um we talked about yeah the rise of

02:13:04
neoliberalization

02:13:06
it hasn't materialized in the same way

02:13:09
or at the same time in different kind of

02:13:11
spaces there's large differences still

02:13:14
between more you could say

02:13:16
Social Democratic

02:13:18
or at least

02:13:20
light versions of social democracy

02:13:24
um Princeton Continental Europe compared

02:13:27
to the UK or the US

02:13:30
so

02:13:31
in Continental Europe in many places

02:13:34
there's still quite a solid social

02:13:37
security system uh minimum wages etc etc

02:13:41
and we kind of identify these are kind

02:13:43
of crucial elements in explaining uh

02:13:48
oh my God promo federalization is

02:13:51
getting late so if you have these kind

02:13:54
of security measures in place it will

02:13:57
immediately kind of prevent at least

02:13:59
informal markets uh that you have a an

02:14:03
explosion at the bottom

02:14:04
um so yeah that's that's something to

02:14:07
take into account and also clearly even

02:14:09
within National context you need to look

02:14:12
at the functions and that's connecting

02:14:14
back today with Harvey uh cities have

02:14:17
different kind of functions and that

02:14:19
will also shape its trajectory if you

02:14:21
look at city like Detroit or Charlotte

02:14:23
War it's not so likely that these places

02:14:27
will now become leading Global

02:14:29
commandment control centers okay

02:14:32
um because they don't simply don't have

02:14:35
that uh that economic trajectory so

02:14:39
that's something this positionality in

02:14:41
global economic systems has also been

02:14:44
taken into account concluding then I

02:14:47
think yeah the future how would it look

02:14:50
like

02:14:51
um this kind of freewheeling here but

02:14:54
it's it's kind of lightly and you can

02:14:57
see in the you know kind of current

02:14:58
developments uh in cities also amid

02:15:01
covet is that it's very likely that

02:15:04
these growing inequalities are only

02:15:07
going to increase

02:15:09
according to me you see that austerity

02:15:12
has been temporarily kind of uh forced

02:15:17
there's a lot of intervention linked to

02:15:19
covet there's again a discourse of a

02:15:21
strong state

02:15:22
but as you saw that you immediately send

02:15:26
a lot of official documents that it had

02:15:28
to be temporary and now you see a return

02:15:31
to a kind of discourse that there will

02:15:33
be again budget cuts need to be made et

02:15:35
cetera etc for instance in Flanders we

02:15:38
are preparing the digi from the digi

02:15:42
jump so our education needs to go

02:15:44
digital

02:15:45
but at the same time we have to have a

02:15:48
budget cut of 100 million euro

02:15:50
so

02:15:52
okay how do you marry those two I mean

02:15:54
for sure there's ways to become more

02:15:57
efficient but at the same time it's not

02:15:59
really credible okay

02:16:01
uh so nothing really has changed I think

02:16:05
in this micro narrative uh of austerity

02:16:08
so that's that's kind of continuing

02:16:11
and uh you could say the flexibilization

02:16:14
of the labor market it's still also

02:16:17
progressing okay

02:16:20
uh it will be different in different

02:16:22
kind of contexts but it's it's it's not

02:16:25
really going away uh migration as you

02:16:29
know

02:16:30
um and this is linked obviously to to

02:16:33
wider issues such as uh uh Global change

02:16:37
will simply be more people that will

02:16:40
have to rely on migration to still make

02:16:42
a living

02:16:44
uh which also means in a lot of cities

02:16:47
if you don't work on Social Security

02:16:48
minimum wage etc etc you will don't you

02:16:52
won't do anything about the uh the whole

02:16:54
discussion about the reserve Army of

02:16:56
Labor so these conditions for

02:16:58
exploitation

02:17:00
will remain in place

02:17:02
so that's kind of working at the at the

02:17:05
bottom end if you will

02:17:06
at the same time at the top end uh and

02:17:09
it's kind of returning a little bit to

02:17:11
the whole discussion about income

02:17:12
distribution at the very start

02:17:14
we see that there's some kind of Return

02:17:16
of the Gilded Age has

02:17:19
um Thomas picketti calls it so a period

02:17:22
in the in the 20th century where in the

02:17:25
19th century sorry uh where a lot of

02:17:30
um you could say personal protectories

02:17:32
were kind of shape there where you where

02:17:34
you already come from so it's a form of

02:17:36
patrimonial capitalism where it matters

02:17:39
more uh who your parents are than what

02:17:43
you do in terms of uh I choose this

02:17:46
profession or that profession I work

02:17:48
with choose to work hard etc etc

02:17:50
and that means that

02:17:52
um

02:17:53
an increasing uh part of of of wealth

02:17:59
is not based on on income but it's based

02:18:03
on other sources of return on assets so

02:18:06
you see that a lot of

02:18:08
a lot of groups that when you talk about

02:18:10
the one percent of the zero point one

02:18:12
percent their income is not

02:18:15
the remuneration of labor but holding

02:18:17
shares uh bonds etc etc

02:18:22
um so this kind of kind of explains why

02:18:26
people that depends on an income from

02:18:30
labor if there's no real wage increases

02:18:34
well you lose out on people that are

02:18:37
basically representing Capital that are

02:18:39
shareholders and that kind of runs away

02:18:41
and this kind of the research by by

02:18:44
picture looking at to the share of the

02:18:46
0.1 so not the one percent but the 0.1

02:18:50
percent

02:18:51
uh in the United States Britain Canada

02:18:53
and Australia

02:18:54
we're back in in the U.S at

02:18:58
um the 0.1 owning seven percent of

02:19:01
income right so 0.1 owns seven percent

02:19:06
of all income in in the US

02:19:09
so it's just just try to imagine what

02:19:11
that means so and it's it's and every

02:19:15
time you see uh economic growth and if

02:19:18
it's not automatic automatically

02:19:19
translated into an increase in wages

02:19:22
which is obviously a whole bargaining

02:19:24
process you see that the return on

02:19:27
Capital increases and but it runs away

02:19:29
from real income

02:19:32
um and I think that will be the main

02:19:34
discussion I think in the post-war era

02:19:36
what you had for instance the US is

02:19:39
extremely progressive taxation the

02:19:42
higher incomes were was taxation up to

02:19:44
70 it was considered normal

02:19:47
what you see now in in multiple

02:19:50
presidencies for instance in the US and

02:19:52
that has been relaxed there are now

02:19:54
counter Tendencies I would say corporate

02:19:57
taxation there's a whole debate about

02:19:59
that to what extent uh we need to kind

02:20:02
of increase that or standardize that it

02:20:05
is a kind of multi-level chess game

02:20:07
uh which will be hard to realize but at

02:20:10
least some things are going on that so I

02:20:12
think yeah at the top end I think I mean

02:20:16
if all goes normal there's no social

02:20:19
upheaval I think the strength will just

02:20:21
continue and the question is to what

02:20:23
extent to when is this socially feasible

02:20:27
to keep things together or will it

02:20:29
really pull apart and political and

02:20:30
other kind of terms when you think about

02:20:32
cities and then as the final point it

02:20:35
means that this function of cities is

02:20:37
becoming uh transformed as well and

02:20:39
maybe this links a little bit to what

02:20:41
Brett Christopher was talking about last

02:20:43
week is that cities become

02:20:45
basically safety deposit boxes for those

02:20:50
people that rely on wealth uh you can

02:20:52
think about absent renterism in London

02:20:55
there's all kinds of neighborhoods that

02:20:57
are owned for instance by people from uh

02:20:59
the Arab Persian Gulf that don't live in

02:21:02
London but just yeah and they don't even

02:21:05
bother to rent out parts of

02:21:07
Knightsbridge or Chelsea because they

02:21:10
don't care because they're the value of

02:21:12
these properties just increases so much

02:21:14
that

02:21:15
it's irrelevant whether you rent it out

02:21:17
another example is shell companies in

02:21:21
Manhattan the Time Warner Center

02:21:24
on average 30 million per Apartments I

02:21:27
think 80 percent of this case is bought

02:21:29
by shell companies which is basically

02:21:31
trusts within a trust within the trust

02:21:33
or whatever so it's somewhere in the

02:21:35
Cayman Islands or Bermuda trust that

02:21:38
boys these uh properties but you never

02:21:40
really know who's behind these shell

02:21:43
companies so it's a way to uh for which

02:21:46
individuals and corporations to buy into

02:21:48
the same profit property

02:21:52
to maintain the value of those assets to

02:21:55
store their wealth in places

02:21:58
and yeah to end on the final point it

02:22:03
means that the function of cities is

02:22:06
being transformed as

02:22:08
yeah as holders of value

02:22:11
uh primarily and according to Sasuke

02:22:14
assassin and the death I conclude

02:22:16
there's a real danger that a process of

02:22:19
deurbanization

02:22:21
is taking place in these leading world

02:22:24
and Global cities and the case of

02:22:27
abstinent terrorism is a good one

02:22:29
there's absolutely no life nobody is

02:22:32
living there it's a kind of pure

02:22:34
financial asset or it's an empty Tower

02:22:37
block where nobody lives

02:22:40
uh and it seems to be a very big

02:22:42
contradiction because when you think

02:22:44
about

02:22:44
bustling bustling world and Global

02:22:47
cities with a lot of innovation and

02:22:51
diversity etc etc

02:22:53
these are empty shells

02:22:55
there to store the value and the wealth

02:22:58
of a very very very very very very rich

02:23:00
people and I think it's a huge issue

02:23:04
that we should reflect on

02:23:06
okay thank you

02:23:10
[Music]

02:23:11
thank you uh I hope it was not too

02:23:15
depressing

02:23:17
um or maybe it that it is depressing and

02:23:20
that we do something about it

02:23:23
um



# 4 Urban segregation: patterns and causes
00:00:00
foreign

00:00:25
[Music]

00:00:29
I see some people with a laptop would

00:00:32
you mind to check whether the webcast is

00:00:34
working put your link on the link of the

00:00:37
link of the live stream

00:00:42
um I think it should be

00:00:44
it should be working I think

00:00:45
[Music]

00:01:10
um

00:01:22
because I think that uh some of you

00:01:26
might know me

00:01:28
and many others might not know me

00:01:31
I am experiments and I will teach this

00:01:35
class and the next one in urban

00:01:39
geography Urban social geography

00:01:42
and I consider myself to be an urban

00:01:44
social person that's a good a good kid I

00:01:47
think

00:01:47
and most of my research has dealt with

00:01:50
migration

00:01:52
newcomers in the city

00:01:54
segregation whiteness

00:01:58
and I've done a PhD with case studies in

00:02:02
kilometers and in South Africa about 70

00:02:04
years in Cape Town to study how white

00:02:07
middle class people moved to the city

00:02:11
and what kind of people they get to meet

00:02:15
uh in in the city

00:02:19
Etc

00:02:19
um so I've done some work on the

00:02:21
geographies of encounter the geographies

00:02:23
of migration

00:02:25
um and this year I have decided to work

00:02:27
less at the University and to spend more

00:02:30
time with my kids and more time on my

00:02:33
bike I like to cycle

00:02:36
um and so it means that I have reduced

00:02:38
my workload at the University and I

00:02:41
still have a 50 teaching assignment

00:02:45
um I teach social geography in the first

00:02:47
year Bachelor of geography I teach some

00:02:51
classes in urban geography I also take

00:02:53
the students on a field trip to Estonia

00:02:56
and this will be the geographers this

00:02:59
year and I've also done that for the

00:03:01
master in urban studies students and

00:03:05
two years ago was the last time I think

00:03:07
we did that

00:03:08
and I'm teaching a course on the city

00:03:11
and migration that's a title at the

00:03:14
University of Louisville so I have quite

00:03:15
some teaching assignments also

00:03:17
supervising some Master's thesis to PhD

00:03:20
thesis so that's what I'm what I'm doing

00:03:25
um I have written here in my presenters

00:03:27
notes who am I and I'm another white

00:03:30
male mid-aged middle class man

00:03:34
that you that you get to see here I

00:03:37
think this issue of positionality is

00:03:39
also an important one especially in the

00:03:41
kind of issues that I will discuss when

00:03:43
it comes to diversity when it comes to

00:03:46
migration what are my experiences in the

00:03:49
city

00:03:49
and so I think that's also something

00:03:51
important to point at and something that

00:03:54
we could discuss

00:03:55
um also

00:03:56
further in the semester like whether

00:03:58
this is something important or or not to

00:04:02
but there will be not so much time for

00:04:04
discussion today and there will be time

00:04:06
for discussion in the seminars and that

00:04:10
will come soon and there will also be

00:04:12
time for discussion on the field trips

00:04:13
I'm going to run through two field trips

00:04:17
for the students this is for the four

00:04:20
cities and the master of urban studies

00:04:22
students so not for all the other ones

00:04:25
and but we have one Excursion to Antwerp

00:04:29
and one Excursion to Shell next week

00:04:32
that I'm going to run and so I wanted to

00:04:35
share some practicalities and I don't

00:04:38
like the fact that I am somehow bound to

00:04:40
my laptop but this is for the live

00:04:42
stream and so it's I hope that it's that

00:04:45
it's uh is working now

00:04:48
um

00:04:48
but so first of all next week Tuesday I

00:04:52
think 40 of you have signed up to go to

00:04:54
Antwerp is that correct who will join me

00:04:57
to Antwerp

00:04:59
yeah

00:05:00
um I will hand out some

00:05:03
Excursion guides and printed them in

00:05:06
color by accident I don't know how happy

00:05:09
the department will be about that if you

00:05:12
get these paper copies in in full colors

00:05:15
so you can take one if you join me yeah

00:05:18
don't take one if you don't join me

00:05:20
because then I will not have enough

00:05:21
copies for everyone

00:05:23
and what is important and that's

00:05:25
something else that I want to hand out

00:05:29
I'm living in Antwerp and so I will meet

00:05:32
you in uh enter a railway station

00:05:38
um

00:05:40
to be in my wallet

00:05:42
who is joining to enter and is familiar

00:05:45
with this

00:05:49
Rail Pass OR Go pass

00:05:52
no one

00:05:54
yeah some people

00:05:56
um so I will give this uh to you and I

00:05:59
would like you for all the people that

00:06:02
join we need one line okay so it says

00:06:07
um this isn't French you can also fill

00:06:10
it in in Dutch or in English the day

00:06:12
Tuesday the date in the Belgian system

00:06:16
with day month year then the place for

00:06:20
American beef that will be Brussels and

00:06:22
then enter

00:06:23
yeah and you need lines for everyone

00:06:26
it's a bit complicated as

00:06:30
um you have tickets for those under 26

00:06:33
and other tickets for those over 26 a

00:06:36
bit more expensive

00:06:38
so I will give them to you

00:07:01
thank you

00:07:16
so good

00:07:18
so it's important that you meet on time

00:07:22
20 to 8 next week Tuesday we are leaving

00:07:25
rather early

00:07:28
um with a train that will have as a

00:07:31
destination

00:07:34
which is a small station to the north of

00:07:36
Antwerp but it's important that you get

00:07:39
off at Antwerpen Central

00:07:41
yeah so the group will meet 740 you take

00:07:46
you make sure that you get on the train

00:07:48

00:07:51
Elena and Louisa will make sure together

00:07:54
with all of you that you have a line for

00:07:56
each student you get on the train and it

00:08:00
will be platform five I guess if you're

00:08:03
late you pay for your own tickets and so

00:08:06
use let's use that as an incentive I

00:08:08
will not reimburse anyone who leaves

00:08:10
late you should travel with the group

00:08:12
and then you all arrive at the same time

00:08:15
according to the schedule at 8 35 and I

00:08:19
will meet you on the platform

00:08:22
yeah so that's what we do we will go

00:08:25
cycling I hope that everyone was aware

00:08:27
of that

00:08:28
it will it is November it will be cold

00:08:31
it will be wet so make sure that you

00:08:34
bring some gloves and some rain gear

00:08:36
because it might um it might be called

00:08:39
bring the Excursion guides especially

00:08:42
now that it has been printed in full

00:08:44
color because you will use that quite a

00:08:46
bit

00:08:47
and we are going to discuss basically

00:08:49
the topics of the this class and next

00:08:51
class so we will discuss segregation and

00:08:54
social mix in the field in Android

00:08:57
we will get to cycle about 25 kilometers

00:08:59
that's quite a bit

00:09:02
um but it has worked out every year

00:09:05
nicely so I trust that it will be the

00:09:08
same

00:09:10
um wear a mouth mask on the train

00:09:12
yeah I don't know what the regulations

00:09:14
will say how how we need to get around

00:09:17
in Antwerp we are quite a big group I

00:09:20
might split you up a couple of times

00:09:23
um bring a lunch or buy one in

00:09:26
Enterprises also I will give you an hour

00:09:28
to to have a lunch but we will be in

00:09:30
quite a fancy part of time so it might

00:09:32
be more complicated to find a cheap

00:09:34
place there but not impossible

00:09:37
yeah so

00:09:39
you will complete these rail passes and

00:09:42
go passes and then you will when you

00:09:44
arrive in anthrope you will give these

00:09:46
two to me

00:09:48
next week Friday I will take you to um

00:09:53
or some of you who will join me to

00:09:55
Charlotte

00:09:57
okay so a similar amount of people and

00:10:01
we will meet in the Brussels railway

00:10:03
station Central so that's important 10

00:10:06
minutes later but still quite early at

00:10:09
10 to 8. in order to be on the train at

00:10:13
seven past eight

00:10:15
yeah again the same system that say I

00:10:18
will be responsible for the rail passes

00:10:20
and the go passes if you're late you

00:10:23
will need to get in touch with a fellow

00:10:24
student to know where we are I'm not

00:10:26
going to wait for you at the train

00:10:27
station in but also you need to pay your

00:10:30
own ticket yeah

00:10:33
um we're going to hike first through the

00:10:35
city but we will also climb some of

00:10:38
these uh at least one Ash Heap in French

00:10:42
so this is a small mountain of yeah

00:10:45
like leftovers from the coal mining it

00:10:48
is quite steep it can be wet so you

00:10:50
should also have some good shoes that

00:10:53
allow you to to do that

00:10:56
bring a pen and paper and I will bring

00:10:58
you a similar kind of Excursion guide

00:11:00
probably in black and white

00:11:04
um for the shadow Excursion

00:11:06
and you can again bring a lunch or buy

00:11:09
one in Charlotte

00:11:11
do we have any practical questions about

00:11:13
these trips

00:11:18
that's a good question

00:11:20
um I think in Shelby I will end around

00:11:22
five meaning you can get back to

00:11:25
Brussels around six but I have a habit

00:11:28
to anti or to give you the possibility

00:11:30
either to get on a train back to

00:11:32
Brussels but I also suggest you to walk

00:11:35
back to Charlotte train station

00:11:38
and but if you want you can be back in

00:11:40
Brussels at six

00:11:42
um from Antwerp we will end at six the

00:11:45
very latest because that's the moment

00:11:46
when I need to give back the bikes to

00:11:49
the bike rental agency and so that means

00:11:51
that you should be able to be back in

00:11:53
Brussels at seven

00:11:56
some other practical questions

00:12:00
no and I'm looking yeah

00:12:04
no you will get a helmet you will get a

00:12:07
look

00:12:09
um if you're very eager to take your own

00:12:12
bike to Anthem it's you can do that on

00:12:14
the train and it's a bit of a hassle but

00:12:16
you will get a nice rental bike you will

00:12:18
get a helmet if you want and you will

00:12:19
get

00:12:21
um a lock for the bike as well

00:12:24
foreign

00:12:26
so I will see you next week I will see

00:12:28
40 of you next week Tuesday in uh in

00:12:33
Antwerp Central Railway Station

00:12:38
um I'm looking forward to that

00:12:40
so these are the practicalities about

00:12:42
the excursions I'm glad that I was able

00:12:44
to share that personally rather than

00:12:46
just another message in the canvas

00:12:50
um today you're not in session one

00:12:52
you're in session four you had an

00:12:54
introductory class you had two classes

00:12:58
on road City formation and polarization

00:13:00
in world global cities and basically

00:13:03
today we will continue a bit on the

00:13:06
theme of class three and I will we will

00:13:09
discuss segregation we will discuss

00:13:12
patterns of segregation and we will just

00:13:14
discuss causes of segregation and next

00:13:17
week I will discuss effects or

00:13:20
Consequences of sick yeah so these are

00:13:22
two classes that fit very well together

00:13:25
and there is a clear theme for each of

00:13:28
them patterns causes of segregation

00:13:30
today affects consequences of

00:13:33
segregation next week

00:13:37
I assume that all of you have read these

00:13:41
two texts

00:13:42
and have you maybe we can I can also

00:13:44
have a look who who has read these two

00:13:47
texts

00:13:49
you can be proud about it who has not

00:13:52
been able to read these two texts you

00:13:54
can also be proud about that okay so I

00:13:57
see that more people have not read it

00:13:59
not read them rather than read them

00:14:03
um for the discussion seminar I think

00:14:05
it's important that we have

00:14:07
like a shared knowledge and these two

00:14:10
texts for this week and the two texts

00:14:12
for next week will be the shared

00:14:14
knowledge together with what is being

00:14:16
shared in the class so I hope that all

00:14:19
of you will be able to read these two

00:14:20
texts and the two for next week by the

00:14:24
time we have the discussions

00:14:28
um

00:14:29
okay

00:14:30
today

00:14:32
I have basically three topics I will

00:14:35
discuss first these classical models of

00:14:37
urban form in the text by pachone which

00:14:40
was a textbook chapter there was a

00:14:42
reference to Burgess I'm going to talk

00:14:44
about Hoyt I'm going to talk about

00:14:46
Harrison Allman some classical models of

00:14:48
urban form that have been generated by

00:14:51
Chicago School Scholars in the beginning

00:14:53
of the 20th century

00:14:56
then secondly I'm going to discuss

00:14:58
patterns of segregation meaning that we

00:15:01
will discuss like how to measure

00:15:03
segregation and

00:15:04
how you can look at segregation from

00:15:07
different angles and then at the end of

00:15:10
the class I will discuss some causes of

00:15:12
segregation why is it that people lit

00:15:15
that poor and rich people live in

00:15:17
different neighborhoods of the city why

00:15:19
is it that you can find white people in

00:15:22
one part of town and people of like

00:15:24
African origin in another part of town

00:15:27
Etc

00:15:28
so this is the topic list for today and

00:15:32
I'm going to start with this classic

00:15:35
Land Use model by Burgess

00:15:38
so those of you who have read the

00:15:40
textbook chapter by pachome have been

00:15:45
reading about the burgers he was writing

00:15:48
from Chicago

00:15:51
1925. I think that's important I will

00:15:56
do the live stream like this I think

00:15:58
that might also still work is everyone

00:15:59
able to hear me at the back here yeah

00:16:02
okay so that's that's going around the

00:16:04
world so what was Burgers doing he was

00:16:07
trying to understand

00:16:09
how cities

00:16:11
were looking like and what kind of

00:16:13
groups groups of people you could find

00:16:15
in different parts of the city

00:16:18
they were stating that basically you had

00:16:21
five

00:16:22
concentric rings

00:16:24
in the Heart of the City there was the

00:16:26
loop

00:16:28
um the loop I will I will discuss that

00:16:30
later it's a term from Chicago basically

00:16:32
the central business district

00:16:34
yeah around that you have the zone of

00:16:37
transition that's how you found it then

00:16:39
around in the third zone of working

00:16:42
working methods the residential Zone

00:16:46
suburban and another uh residential Zone

00:16:49
with reaching out the commuters so five

00:16:52
rings around the city

00:16:55
and why was it that you have these five

00:16:57
rings well

00:16:59
because different functions in the city

00:17:02
in different groups of people were able

00:17:06
to pay different rents

00:17:10
so the theory was that in the center of

00:17:13
the city the central business district

00:17:16
you found

00:17:18
for example the headquarters of an

00:17:20
office

00:17:21
because they were able to pay the higher

00:17:24
rents that you had so close to the city

00:17:27
center

00:17:28
and further away from the city

00:17:31
was the theory you would find for

00:17:34
example

00:17:35
Suburban plots

00:17:38
um what's very intense because these

00:17:40
people were able to spend to pay less

00:17:43
rents

00:17:44
for their part of

00:17:47
so this is really Theory

00:17:52
um was basically underlying this model

00:17:56
of concentric things

00:17:58
yeah this term model can be a little bit

00:18:01
confusing

00:18:03
and because it could give you the

00:18:04
impression that this is an ideal type

00:18:06
like this is how it sit all through yeah

00:18:09
but Burgers was trying to do but

00:18:12
basically to

00:18:13
simplify reality and to understand how

00:18:16
cities were not necessarily how they

00:18:19
opened it how our cities and we try to

00:18:22
simplify it and that's how a simplified

00:18:25
version of Chicago of a western City

00:18:29
looks like

00:18:32
I told you already written in 1925

00:18:37
yeah that's very important why because

00:18:40
we are at a moment in time this is the

00:18:42
population of Chicago from 1840 to 2014

00:18:48
we are at a moment in time 1925 when

00:18:52
this population of Chicago has been

00:18:55
growing through an exponential growth

00:18:57
for many many years

00:18:59
yeah and that also explains why

00:19:03
Burgess was making a model of the growth

00:19:07
of the system

00:19:08
yeah it's not a model of any City it's

00:19:11
the model of a growing city and he tries

00:19:14
to understand how this growth of a City

00:19:16
Works

00:19:18
both in terms of a growing population

00:19:22
but also

00:19:23
a city that is characterized by an

00:19:26
expanding area that is built the

00:19:28
environment

00:19:29
is growing and so it's a level of the

00:19:32
growth of the city

00:19:34
and writing from Chicago in 1925 well

00:19:39
this is a very particular growing city

00:19:41
this is a city of immigration where a

00:19:44
lot of immigrants

00:19:46
are from all over the world but from

00:19:48
Europe in particularly initially arrived

00:19:52
and where they settle

00:19:54
and where you see that in

00:19:57
1900 you had less than 2 million people

00:20:00
and uh you need to go only 10 15 years

00:20:03
later to find another amazing into added

00:20:06
to the population and so this is a fast

00:20:09
growing City

00:20:13
um both in terms of population and in

00:20:15
terms of the area that is built up

00:20:17
that's also expanding that's also true

00:20:22
um it's also a city that is

00:20:25
characterized by heterogeneous

00:20:26
population so what you see here is the

00:20:29
result of a survey

00:20:32
going from house to house knocking on

00:20:35
people's door and then checking whether

00:20:36
there is someone English speaking in

00:20:40
White Irish in green German in purple

00:20:44
Dutch in dark purple Russian in red Etc

00:20:48
and so you see that the city was

00:20:51
characterized by a heterogeneous organic

00:20:53
all these people coming from different

00:20:56
countries of origin arriving in Chicago

00:20:59
at that time okay so it's a particular

00:21:01
City that Burgers is writing from and

00:21:05
I'm saying that because I want to argue

00:21:07
that this theory that Virgos made up and

00:21:11
which he thought was Universal for

00:21:14
growing cities was in in fact

00:21:17
a theory that was mostly applicable to

00:21:20
Chicago itself yeah and so here you see

00:21:24
a couple of assumptions which are also

00:21:26
mentioned

00:21:27
uh in the in the text that you've read

00:21:29
or that you're going to read

00:21:31
the assumptions and principles that were

00:21:34
underlying this theory of the model of

00:21:39
um the growing city of the growth so you

00:21:42
see that the assumption is that there is

00:21:45
this cultural and social approach

00:21:48
of the population

00:21:50
you could also think of other cities

00:21:52
yeah in countries which are less smart

00:21:55
by this kind of diversity

00:21:59
and the second assumption is that there

00:22:01
is a commercial industrial base to the

00:22:04
economy of the city

00:22:06
could you think of other

00:22:08
basis to the economy of the city

00:22:13
that kind of other places could you have

00:22:16
rather than commercial that's true

00:22:21
tourism yeah if you go to a city that is

00:22:25
marked by two resistance for example

00:22:27
each

00:22:28
distribute could be of any importance

00:22:31
please

00:22:32
yeah while in a commercial industrial

00:22:34
city it's a meteorological But Central

00:22:37
Business districts the center office

00:22:40
during the city is dominated by a

00:22:44
touristic cities well then you would get

00:22:46
different

00:22:47
I know also saw other characters

00:22:56
based yeah then you would hit the

00:22:58
Heritage I could also Imagine like

00:23:01
cities that draw a lot of pilgrims a

00:23:04
religious basis to the city of Temple or

00:23:07
a church would be Central places Etc so

00:23:10
you can think of other kinds of cities

00:23:13
yeah and then the the idea of burgers

00:23:16
would be that this model of urban growth

00:23:20
private ownership of property economic

00:23:22
competition for space you can imagine

00:23:25
other cities

00:23:26
in the Soviet Union for example plan the

00:23:28
economy different kind of systems

00:23:32
um for expanding area and population of

00:23:35
the city many cities in in Europe are

00:23:38
nowadays marked by shrinkage

00:23:41
yeah in Eastern Germany for example

00:23:46
um Genova in Italy city that has been

00:23:49
marked by shrinkage for a very long time

00:23:52
Detroit

00:23:53
a city in North America

00:23:55
that has gone through a similar

00:23:59
fifth essential transport is equally

00:24:01
easy easy rapid and key in every

00:24:05
direction within the city

00:24:07
it's hard to imagine how that would ever

00:24:09
be possible because you will always have

00:24:11
transport infrastructure that will allow

00:24:13
you to move from one end of the city

00:24:15
much more quickly to another end than to

00:24:18
another part of the city

00:24:20
okay number five the city center is the

00:24:23
main Center for employment and therefore

00:24:26
most credible

00:24:27
people also think to many other kinds of

00:24:30
city where for example the airport is an

00:24:32
important top and you have a big

00:24:35
um big development around this Airport

00:24:38
so these things are more attractive

00:24:40
because of differences in terrain I told

00:24:43
you I did my PhD on Cape Town you've got

00:24:45
the Atlantic Ocean you've got Table

00:24:47
Mountain you can imagine that these

00:24:49
differences in terrain are very

00:24:51
important to understand how this city is

00:24:54
owned

00:24:56
you have no concentrations of heavy

00:24:58
industry

00:24:59
yeah and you have no historic survival

00:25:02
of an earlier land use pattern in any

00:25:04
District

00:25:05
there is no Heritage do you have a 19th

00:25:09
century housing or a medieval argument

00:25:12
City yeah and so

00:25:15
um verbis himself already acknowledged

00:25:17
that it hardly needs to be added and I'm

00:25:20
quoting this that neither Chicago nor

00:25:23
any other City fits perfectly into this

00:25:27
ideal ski

00:25:28
complications in Chicago are introduced

00:25:32
by the lakefront the lake in Chicago

00:25:35
so there is a difference

00:25:38
the Chicago River another difference in

00:25:42
Korea railroad lines which mean that

00:25:45
which major transport is not equally

00:25:47
easy rapidly cheap in every direction

00:25:50
and historical factors in the location

00:25:53
of industry and which might mean that

00:25:55
you have concentrations of heavy

00:25:58
industry in some parts

00:26:01
um Etc

00:26:02
and so you see the acknowledgment that

00:26:04
well I'm trying to

00:26:06
formulate a universal model of urban

00:26:10
growth but well underlying my theory are

00:26:15
a lot of assumptions and principles

00:26:16
which mean that basically I'm writing

00:26:20
uh

00:26:22
I'm writing up a model of a specific

00:26:24
City in Chicago and basically my model

00:26:27
was composed for Chicago doesn't even

00:26:31
hold for Chicago itself because there

00:26:32
are many complicated factors okay

00:26:36
um I will I will discuss this further in

00:26:40
a bit like and we

00:26:42
in in urban studies we have been going

00:26:44
through a moment where we

00:26:46
um I started to realize well many of our

00:26:48
theories are provincial when we write

00:26:51
about gentrification and we make a

00:26:53
theory of gentrification then if we make

00:26:56
a case on Brussels then we write a very

00:26:59
Western kind of perspective

00:27:01
gentrification so it's necessary to

00:27:04
de-provincialize our theories I find it

00:27:07
interesting that already 100 years ago

00:27:09
there was this awareness that well me

00:27:12
burgers I'm writing from Chicago and

00:27:14
this is important to to understand

00:27:18
um

00:27:19
so how did this model look like I will

00:27:22
run through this Central Central most

00:27:26
Central concentric ring is the group you

00:27:29
have a wider group

00:27:30
and if you've ever been to Chicago

00:27:32
you've got this Metro lines that all

00:27:35
converge in the city and where basically

00:27:38
this whole Metro is making a loop and

00:27:40
then taking back the line from where

00:27:43
it's going so you have this elevated

00:27:46
metal track

00:27:48
but in a loop in the shape of a loop and

00:27:51
so that's why the essential business

00:27:53
that speak of Chicago is called

00:27:57
so this is the place where you have

00:27:59
shopping

00:28:01
uh where you have offices or you have

00:28:04
headquarters of companies where you

00:28:06
expect to find theaters

00:28:10
um Etc because these are the functions

00:28:12
that are able to pay the highest rent

00:28:16
the highest price for the central

00:28:18
voltage why do they want to be in the

00:28:20
central location well these are all

00:28:22
functions that need to draw

00:28:25
um office workers Shoppers theater goers

00:28:30
from all corners of the city and so for

00:28:33
them it is important to be in the

00:28:35
central location that is easy to reach

00:28:39
from everywhere in this and so they want

00:28:42
to be in

00:28:43
the loop

00:28:46
and Chicago 1925 a picture the video of

00:28:51
ID busy streets the first skyscrapers of

00:28:56
the world in the city earlier than New

00:28:59
York and so you have basically the first

00:29:01
city where you have this

00:29:04
um how to say that like this classical

00:29:07
uh Central Business districts from a

00:29:09
North American Town Syria it's all

00:29:12
skyscrapers

00:29:14
so Zone one the Central Business this

00:29:19
around this you have

00:29:21
The Zone in transition the zone of Truth

00:29:25
basically what you find there is factors

00:29:30
why do these factories want to be

00:29:32
located there they also rely on labor

00:29:36
that needs to come in by a trend by

00:29:39
Metro

00:29:40
Etc so they also want to be in a central

00:29:43
location that allows them to bring in

00:29:45
workers from all corners but they are

00:29:49
not able to pay these high prices for

00:29:52
lands but these functions on the

00:29:54
previous slides were able to offer them

00:29:56
and some of you find a second ring in

00:30:00
which you have these factors

00:30:03
not only factories you also find

00:30:06
neighborhoods there

00:30:08
yeah who wants to live close to these

00:30:11
factories nobody this is very polluted

00:30:15
this is very dirty these are very bad

00:30:17
living circumstances so who ends up here

00:30:21
the first generation of immigrants from

00:30:24
different countries of origin yeah and

00:30:27
as soon as these people are able to

00:30:29
perform a move to a better part of town

00:30:33
then they will do so

00:30:36
they have to do some of these names that

00:30:38
you find on these pictures

00:30:40
little hell tells quite a bit

00:30:43
but also the fact that for example here

00:30:46
we have Little Sicily so this is a part

00:30:49
of town where these Sicilians arrive but

00:30:52
that was formerly little Sweden

00:30:55
yeah so you see how one group of

00:30:59
newcomers moves out and is Then followed

00:31:02
by a new group of people from another

00:31:05
country of origin that was what Burgess

00:31:08
was noticing in 1925. and so this is the

00:31:12
part of the Chicago close to the central

00:31:16
business District close to the loop

00:31:19
in the middle of all these factories

00:31:22
where people who just landed off the

00:31:25
boat

00:31:26
from Europe arrived and so you have

00:31:29
subsequent

00:31:30
groups ethnicities of newcomers who

00:31:33
arrive

00:31:35
people who have been able to climb the

00:31:38
social leather they will move out of

00:31:41
these areas and they are able to afford

00:31:45
a better home

00:31:47
further away from these factories and

00:31:49
they are also able to afford the commute

00:31:52
between home and the world so there's

00:31:55
also a price

00:31:56
to be paid for this so the purpose is

00:31:59
writing there about the zone of

00:32:01
independent working man's hopes

00:32:05
and in his vocabulary which is the

00:32:08
respectable working class is working

00:32:11
it's living in the episode

00:32:14
and so I found it interesting that

00:32:17
um

00:32:18
like here six miles north west of the

00:32:22
loop

00:32:23
West yeah so we are moving in that

00:32:25
direction about 10 kilometers out of the

00:32:28
loop you also have an area of Chicago at

00:32:31
that time where you had quite some

00:32:32
belgians living yeah and Burgess was

00:32:35
also writing about the belgians many of

00:32:38
them were janitors so they also have

00:32:40
like a specific profession uh that many

00:32:43
of them were known

00:32:46
and they also had a clip so you see here

00:32:49
1921 all belgians are equal

00:32:52
oh the um to build a club for belgians

00:32:58
celebrating Belgium space and Belgian

00:33:01
Traditions you have the Saint John

00:33:03
bergman's Church Cynthia

00:33:06
in Chicago and so up to today you can

00:33:09
visit this neighborhood that was marked

00:33:12
by belgians and in the past

00:33:14
yeah but you also had neighborhoods

00:33:16
where you had many Germans or many

00:33:19
Russians or many Italians who had been

00:33:22
able to plan this social leather and who

00:33:24
had been able to out with further away

00:33:28
from this

00:33:31
I've also shown you this map of this

00:33:35
survey going door to door there was a

00:33:37
lot of heterogeneity even in streets but

00:33:40
some neighborhoods were also marked by

00:33:42
this ethnic groups

00:33:46
and then as you go further away from the

00:33:49
loop you get to more Suburban less dense

00:33:53
developments and here you see the

00:33:56
neighborhood of Mount prospects about 25

00:33:59
miles north west from the loop so we are

00:34:03
moving about 40 kilometers out of the

00:34:06
route now 30 to 60 Minutes commute to

00:34:10
the loop by train and so the moment that

00:34:12
these trains are being trained lines are

00:34:15
being built you see this kind of

00:34:17
suburban developments and then you see

00:34:20
and

00:34:21
find prospects 1917

00:34:24
this is a cape to commemorate the 50th

00:34:27
anniversary

00:34:29
but you also see who is living there

00:34:31
long twist Swedish families who have

00:34:35
arrived quite early and will be able to

00:34:37
find this social media that will arrived

00:34:40
a little Sweden but then we moved to the

00:34:42
Zone respectable working men's homes has

00:34:46
very discovered who have been able to as

00:34:49
they climbed the social level we have

00:34:51
also been able to

00:34:52
to this Suburban developments in between

00:34:55
four part

00:35:03
IES

00:35:07
I'm sorry further further red

00:35:11
part of it is becoming more expensive

00:35:14
yeah but you need to you need to see it

00:35:16
uh rent for like you need to pay dollars

00:35:20
per square meter

00:35:21
and so closer you get

00:35:24
to the city center the 10 service

00:35:27
development

00:35:28
and so for that reason it's not about

00:35:31
life what what you can afford but it's

00:35:33
how much you are willing to pay per

00:35:36
second

00:35:37
yeah and so these developments closer to

00:35:39
the sensor are much more dense

00:35:42
yeah so that explains why this picture

00:35:44
and curve is still going down

00:35:52
Burgers so the concentric zone model

00:35:57
and and a theory that has

00:36:00
is still being being being used but even

00:36:04
today if you read about newcomers and

00:36:06
cities and neighborhoods of arrival and

00:36:09
people still refer to Ferguson

00:36:12
conceptualized his arrival of newcomers

00:36:15
in Chicago and the kind of neighborhoods

00:36:18
that they were going through as they

00:36:20
climbed the social touch

00:36:24
yeah

00:36:26
um but you also have other models

00:36:29
um I'm still before the second World War

00:36:32
avoids another researcher who studied

00:36:36
142 American cities

00:36:39
and who stated in the beginning of his

00:36:42
paper that so far reaching are the

00:36:45
changes in our population pattern and

00:36:48
social structure that it can well be

00:36:51
asked whether theories of City growth

00:36:53
and structure formulated for the private

00:36:56
enterprise economy of the late 19th and

00:36:59
20th centuries is not referring to

00:37:01
Burgers but it could be will be

00:37:04
applicable in a future society that may

00:37:07
be of a fundamentally different nature

00:37:09
what happens between 1925 and 1939 in

00:37:14
America what kind of changes could be so

00:37:18
important that you that they have an

00:37:20
impact on the model of uh

00:37:26
yeah the depression so this is about

00:37:28
crisis a moment of economic crisis

00:37:32
yes and when you look at

00:37:34
I will go a couple of slides back

00:37:39
when you look at population growth

00:37:43
and in Chicago then you see that this

00:37:49
crisis 1929 the 1930s but this has a

00:37:53
clear impact also on the population of

00:37:57
as people are eager to immigrate to a

00:38:01
country in crisis the government is also

00:38:03
more strict on who can come

00:38:06
Etc and so

00:38:08
there is a big economic crisis that also

00:38:11
means that there is less migration

00:38:13
whether it's related to less migration

00:38:15
to the states

00:38:16
there are also other

00:38:18
phenomena

00:38:20
yeah so Boyd was writing himself a new

00:38:23
theory of Simply grade growth may be

00:38:25
necessary to fit the effects of a period

00:38:28
when cities grow more slowly

00:38:31
yeah that's what I told you already but

00:38:33
also when Automobiles and airplanes

00:38:36
remove dependency on fixed rails

00:38:39
the car becomes much more important if

00:38:43
you can imagine that a City built for

00:38:45
car drivers looks quite different from a

00:38:49
city that is built for people who take a

00:38:51
tram or a Metro or a train

00:38:54
and he also adds that what is also

00:38:56
different is that there's more

00:38:58
government control and Taxation for

00:39:00
fighting costs for the benefit of the

00:39:02
poor this is a graph that tells you

00:39:05
something about

00:39:06
taxation of the top internal rates in

00:39:10
the states and so you see that this has

00:39:11
been going through quite some changes

00:39:14
yeah and then as described as

00:39:17
when America was hit by crisis that

00:39:19
there was an urge to to have more

00:39:23
effects more income tax to this highest

00:39:27
now what that means is that government

00:39:29
can also intervene more in-house in

00:39:33
infrastructure

00:39:34
etc etc

00:39:37
um so a couple of changes that these

00:39:39
cities have been going through and so

00:39:41
art is saying well these models made for

00:39:44
cities of a particular kind remember

00:39:48
these assumptions of burgers do not hold

00:39:51
true in the cities that I am studying in

00:39:54
the 1930s it's 140. City speakers we see

00:39:59
a lot of different kind of processes

00:40:03
so voids came up with a sector

00:40:09
a sector theory saying that well you

00:40:12
still have this Central business

00:40:13
district in the city because around this

00:40:16
they do not have a couple of

00:40:19
drinks but you have sectors

00:40:22
yeah and the assumption is that when the

00:40:25
city grows

00:40:27
each of these sectors will grow and so

00:40:30
if you have to the now in this case to

00:40:34
the east

00:40:37
sector in which the richest people are

00:40:39
living and the assumption is that when

00:40:42
these group growth or the population of

00:40:44
the city grows that this sector will

00:40:47
also grow to the east

00:40:50
and so you have a couple of different

00:40:52
sectors high class medium

00:40:56
which are also organized by the

00:40:58
transportation

00:41:01
infrastructure and so you would have

00:41:04
industry factories concentrated along

00:41:08
rivers canals Rail lines on roads

00:41:12
immediately next to that you would have

00:41:14
low class residential areas just like

00:41:18
burgers assumed

00:41:20
but Burgers assumed that these factories

00:41:22
and the lowest

00:41:24
low-class areas would be located in a

00:41:27
concentric ring and boy it was saying

00:41:30
well if you look at cities in the 30s in

00:41:33
America and the sector model comes

00:41:36
closer to reality so this is a better

00:41:38
way to simplify how cities are looking

00:41:44
um so sectors rather than concentric

00:41:47
Rings what is also important is that

00:41:49
there's much more emphasis on Class A

00:41:53
medium class low class high class while

00:41:56
Burgers was often writing from these

00:41:58
ethnic groups Italians Sicilians uh

00:42:02
Germans Russians Swedish people arriving

00:42:06
in the city

00:42:10
um

00:42:13
okay a third model

00:42:16
is the one by Harris alone and this is a

00:42:19
graph

00:42:20
or a picture that comes from their paper

00:42:23
we moved on the 1945 and you see that in

00:42:27
their paper they make a reference

00:42:29
already which is concentric so novel by

00:42:32
Burgess they refer to the secret Theory

00:42:35
by Boyd and then they come up with their

00:42:38
own model which is called the multiple

00:42:40
nuclear model of a city

00:42:45
um and you see indeed that they have

00:42:47
this kind of jigsaw puzzle that

00:42:50
represents the city for them in which

00:42:52
you still find number one a central

00:42:54
business district and next to it and the

00:42:58
next with the district with wholesale

00:42:59
light manufacturing but you also see a

00:43:02
couple of other notes that are important

00:43:05
to understand the city for example seven

00:43:08
and outlying business

00:43:11
yeah so this is an important difference

00:43:14
between these two models and that one

00:43:16
there's not just one Central business

00:43:19
district which you also have important

00:43:21
business districts in other parts of the

00:43:24
city

00:43:25
for example in London even in in the

00:43:30
history

00:43:31
they have this economic heart

00:43:34
of the city of the city close to Tower

00:43:38
Bridge and you've got a political Heart

00:43:40
of the City close to Westminster epic

00:43:42
but there is a distance between while in

00:43:46
this traditional models you would expect

00:43:48
them to be concentrated and close to

00:43:50
each other in the central business

00:43:52
district

00:43:54
I also refer to Chicago I say there are

00:43:57
a couple of

00:43:58
Industries or universities which are in

00:44:03
very different parts of the city than

00:44:05
this Burgers model

00:44:07
and expected so they refer to area of

00:44:11
heavy industry and posted the

00:44:14
the river and the lake and then also

00:44:17
this University of Chicago to the South

00:44:19
which is then again like the hook of uh

00:44:24
like an area in which you find middle

00:44:27
class people University lecturers and

00:44:29
people working

00:44:31
in a part of time where you would not

00:44:33
expect them to and so they also look at

00:44:37
these kind of spikes in the big

00:44:39
difference saying that well normally

00:44:42
according to burgers this would always

00:44:44
go down

00:44:46
by the the further you get from the city

00:44:50
center the lower is bitter and curve

00:44:54
would be the lower the price per square

00:44:57
meter that people companies or other

00:45:00
functions are willing to fail but then

00:45:03
Arizona would say well you always find

00:45:06
this kind of local spikes for example

00:45:08
local shopping centers not all the

00:45:11
shopping is happening

00:45:13
the central business district and so

00:45:15
also you can find these local shopping

00:45:16
centers or a satellite City and around

00:45:21
which you find again like is a

00:45:23
decreasing can be transfers yeah so a

00:45:26
third model here is an omen where you

00:45:29
have multiple nuclei

00:45:32
more than one Center basically and you

00:45:36
get this kind of jigsaw puzzle to to

00:45:39
simplify an urban form

00:45:42
in this Theory they only consider those

00:45:46

00:45:48
or well or in that case in that City

00:45:53
yeah every city will have a different

00:45:56
kind of home but their main argument is

00:45:59
that these models are too simplistic

00:46:01
and not everything is radiating from one

00:46:04
Center but in practice you will always

00:46:06
find

00:46:07
it so that's why reality looks more

00:46:10
complex than in decimals

00:46:14
okay

00:46:16
um

00:46:20
why to go back to Chicago why to go back

00:46:23
to theories that have been written 100

00:46:25
years ago I think it's interesting to

00:46:27
make Urban geographers or people who do

00:46:30
Urban studies who made them think about

00:46:33
the form of a city and who is living

00:46:36
where

00:46:37
and so on the left you have here a map

00:46:40
of Chicago

00:46:42
nowadays and each dot basically

00:46:45
represents one person

00:46:47
lost Maps Detroit automatic Network

00:46:50
finds maps for other American cities

00:46:54
like this and so you you see here that

00:46:57
basically the different colors on the

00:46:59
map represent different people who

00:47:03
self-identified with different races

00:47:06
slash ethnicities

00:47:08
yeah so and I think you find people

00:47:11
self-identified as the white in the year

00:47:14
2010 in blue you find people who

00:47:17
self-identified as black in green people

00:47:21
who self-identify as Asian and in Orange

00:47:24
people who self-identify as Hispanic

00:47:29
in the American context uh race slash

00:47:33
ethnicity corresponds very much with

00:47:35
clocks

00:47:36
that's if you would have a map with

00:47:39
socioeconomic classes then you would

00:47:41
also find that most of these

00:47:42
neighborhoods which turn out to be

00:47:45
thinking

00:47:47
and you have a majority of

00:47:48
self-identified as why but this will

00:47:51
also be the better of any business

00:47:54
and that the neighborhoods with people

00:47:56
who self-identified black could be

00:47:59
underprivileged

00:48:02
so now my question for you is which of

00:48:05
these models of urban form the

00:48:08
concentric

00:48:09
remodel by Burgess

00:48:12
a sector model by voids for this

00:48:14
multiple nuclear model can you find on

00:48:17
the map

00:48:19
foreign

00:48:27
models on the map so when you look at

00:48:30
this

00:48:31
closely what what do you see who sees

00:48:45
you find this kind of sectors

00:48:49
yeah

00:48:51
and in heat I have the metro map of

00:48:54
Chicago this will be the center of

00:48:56
business districts you have like pieces

00:48:58
of pie

00:49:00
that starts from the central business so

00:49:03
indeed much of Chicago nowadays

00:49:06
is still looking like voids would have

00:49:08
predicted between these different

00:49:09
sectors

00:49:11
corresponding with different populations

00:49:13
groups different socio-economic classes

00:49:16
low-class high-class medium class to use

00:49:19
the vocabulary line at Five Points so in

00:49:22
this you can still find that yeah

00:49:26
Burgess

00:49:38
okay so what is representative

00:49:42
where it is considered to be relevant

00:49:44
100 years ago we still make maps like

00:49:47
this so for some reason we still find it

00:49:49
important please

00:49:52
but when you look at the pattern

00:49:55
yeah

00:49:56
pleasure

00:50:00
uh

00:50:08
okay so indeed it's very hard to see

00:50:14
concentric sense the ring one because

00:50:17
there will be very few residents of the

00:50:19
central business district

00:50:20
it's also hard to spot concentric Rim 2

00:50:23
it's also a large response concentric

00:50:25
ring three but then when you move

00:50:28
further away from the city center it's

00:50:30
ring number four and room number five

00:50:34
where Burgers would have expected the

00:50:36
better off

00:50:37
residents who have climbed a social

00:50:39
leather you can still see that even

00:50:41
today these are indeed the places where

00:50:44
you find almost exclusively white

00:50:47
dominated neighborhoods and so this this

00:50:50
is still the case

00:50:52
and so this ring number four and five

00:50:54
are still there

00:50:56
is an omen

00:50:58
multiple nucleus

00:51:01
clusters

00:51:08
yeah you can indeed find for example if

00:51:11
you see an example

00:51:13
like is there is

00:51:29
okay so indeed you have a cluster of

00:51:31
this Hispanic people who self-identify

00:51:34
as Islamic in the South and that's

00:51:36
around this uh calumet's River

00:51:41
industry area

00:51:43
yeah you also have a cluster of whites

00:51:48
in a sector that is

00:51:50
blue that is dominated by people who

00:51:52
self-identified as black and this is

00:51:57
this a University of Chicago premises

00:52:00
so up to today you can still see

00:52:04
uh remnants of this Harrison Omen model

00:52:08
and also the reasons why they wanted to

00:52:11
refine or give more detail to this

00:52:14
concentric green model and sector

00:52:17
so I hope that these models

00:52:21
make you think about how different

00:52:23
cities look like and that they also make

00:52:27
you aware of well in different types of

00:52:29
cities

00:52:30
you have different ethnic groups

00:52:33
different social economic classes

00:52:35
make taking out different parts and this

00:52:38
can be very different but Brussels for

00:52:40
example is a city where poverty is very

00:52:43
Central

00:52:46
we have the medieval city but then when

00:52:49
you go out of the vehicle you get to the

00:52:51
19th century development related to

00:52:54
industrialization this is where you find

00:52:56
the poorest neighborhood versus cattle

00:52:58
Beach

00:53:03
these are poor districts

00:53:06
very close to the medieval

00:53:09
you have other kinds of cities for

00:53:11
example Paris where you have much more

00:53:14
wealth close to the city center and

00:53:17
where you have much of the poverty and

00:53:19
very peripheral locations

00:53:21
and so it is interesting to compare

00:53:23
different cities and to understand where

00:53:26
is poverty located where do different

00:53:29
racial ethnic groups live in in the city

00:53:35
and so when you do that

00:53:37
you will also be able to make a a

00:53:40
simplified model of the city that you

00:53:42
are familiar with for the city that you

00:53:44
want to study and you will also come to

00:53:47
an understanding that these burgers and

00:53:48
poison Arizona bubbles are very

00:53:51
simplistic and that in different

00:53:53
countries in different cities you would

00:53:57
have very different models

00:53:59
and I have a couple of examples

00:54:01
this is one from Piercy that is also

00:54:04
used in the textbook where you have in

00:54:07
the British complex is Council Estates

00:54:11
yeah built on peripheral land and so in

00:54:14
a concentric ring where Alice harrisman

00:54:17
and Burgess would expect private

00:54:20
Suburban housing we also have these

00:54:23
Council Estates just like these born

00:54:25
years in the French context where much

00:54:28
of the poverty is peripheral

00:54:31
yeah while that contradicts Birds

00:54:37
the Chinese

00:54:39
city was ever a word of the change

00:54:42
my pronunciation will be very cool okay

00:54:52
nobody cities in China also fast growing

00:54:56
in China you basically have a new look

00:54:59
for an urban citizenship

00:55:04
foreign

00:55:06
and you have villages

00:55:09
which

00:55:11
were taken up by farmers

00:55:15
which are rural pieces of land where you

00:55:18
have people with this brutal citizenship

00:55:20
with the rural living when people from

00:55:23
the countryside migrate to the city they

00:55:26
are able to take up residence in these

00:55:30
old villages

00:55:33
their citizenship if I may say it like

00:55:36
that allows them to stay in this area

00:55:39
so you have in many Chinese cities parts

00:55:43
of the city that look like that where

00:55:45
you have a very formal part immediately

00:55:48
next to a part of the city that looks

00:55:51
much more informal much more dense and

00:55:54
that's because when the city grows over

00:55:56
this Countryside that these brutal

00:56:00
villages

00:56:01
from the past become these villages in

00:56:04
the city where you have a lot of

00:56:06
newcomers arrived and so these Chinese

00:56:09
cities the model of the Chinese City

00:56:11
would look very differently from Burgers

00:56:14
because you have these areas that

00:56:18
used to be Villages or centers of

00:56:21
religious and where you have people with

00:56:25
immigrating from Countryside from other

00:56:27
parts of China who arrived there uh

00:56:32
to this change I think it means

00:56:35
something like Village in the city

00:56:37
and these are foreign

00:56:42
the African City

00:56:45
at the flag of from 1962 very different

00:56:49
again because transport is much more

00:56:52
complicated

00:56:54
and so rich people prefer to live close

00:56:57
to the citizen and the poorest of the

00:56:59
food who arrive from the countryside

00:57:01
will arrive at the very ends of the city

00:57:04
a very peripheral locations where it

00:57:06
takes you two or three hours to get

00:57:09
so these cities look different again

00:57:14
Mike Davis

00:57:15
Los Angeles you might have heard of The

00:57:18
Chicago School burgers for example that

00:57:21
you might also have heard of those

00:57:22
angels group or of course modern

00:57:24
photographers writing from Los Angeles

00:57:27
and Mike Davis and who wrote an

00:57:30
interesting book in 1992 and trying to

00:57:32
make the 1998 UFC who made a model of

00:57:37
how that Los Angeles looked like in the

00:57:40
90s yeah and you might have heard of

00:57:44
Skid Row

00:57:45
it's a part of the city where you have

00:57:47
thousands of homeless people

00:57:50
and living on the streets just next to

00:57:52
the central business district of Los

00:57:54
Angeles say this is the zone of

00:57:56
transition and this is where the poorest

00:57:58
of the poor live

00:58:00
immediately next to the central business

00:58:03
district

00:58:04
but you also end up at that time these

00:58:06
gated to developments

00:58:08
at the periphery of the city where you

00:58:12
had the richest of the rich living in

00:58:15
these gated suburbs so you could also

00:58:17
see that basically this

00:58:20
borders between the different Rings were

00:58:23
being walled and fortified

00:58:25
enclaves

00:58:27
so he was trying to make a mobile

00:58:30
of Los Angeles in the 1990s

00:58:35
barred by this desperate poverty some

00:58:37
parts of the city and then also this

00:58:41
um

00:58:42
both in other parts

00:58:45
and in the end there are still a lot of

00:58:47
burgers in this model there's still the

00:58:49
Central Business districts that are

00:58:51
still core and there is still this

00:58:53
poorest of the poor Living Community

00:58:55
mixed not in the zone of transition

00:58:58
between which the factories and then

00:59:01
this little hell or Little Sicily that

00:59:03
people living on the streets

00:59:05
and then the the more you move out of

00:59:08
the city center the Richer this

00:59:10
neighborhoods get it's also very much

00:59:14
so try to make a model of Los Angeles in

00:59:18

00:59:24
yeah I I

00:59:27
one hour ago I took out a slide with a

00:59:29
bottle for talent and again trying to

00:59:32
understand for the post-socialist city

00:59:35
and look like but then also

00:59:38
using Talon as an example but also

00:59:40
trying to understand like what kind of

00:59:42
developments do we see in these

00:59:44
socialist cities and then in these

00:59:47
post-socials and how can we try to

00:59:49
generalize that simplify

00:59:52
and so the attempts to make a model is

00:59:55
an attempt to simplify reality and to

00:59:58
try and understand what is particular

01:00:00
about cities and what makes Los Angeles

01:00:04
different from Chicago in 1925

01:00:08
so you also have indeed bubbles for

01:00:11
European cities this was a British City

01:00:13
kearsely in this Council Estates but you

01:00:17
could also make a model for Stockholm

01:00:19
and try to think like what is specific

01:00:21
about Stockholm I'll just look forward

01:00:23
compared to other cities

01:00:37
not that I know because this this

01:00:39
attempt has been like it's very much

01:00:43
um and indeed you could think how these

01:00:44
assumptions that Burgers Sunday

01:00:48
or the diet stand up on the slide and

01:00:50
they finally the textbook whether some

01:00:52
of them are

01:00:55
at typically

01:00:57
like for example this idea that cannot

01:01:00
be an early invention so European cities

01:01:03
tend to have

01:01:04
a long history and so for that reason

01:01:06
there are always parts of the city

01:01:08
equipment is already something you have

01:01:11
a growing City

01:01:22
there's also much more State

01:01:23
intervention

01:01:25
so we could think like how the European

01:01:28
city would be different from uh these

01:01:31
assumptions of burgers and what that

01:01:32
would mean then for the model works

01:01:36
I have no bundled but it could be an

01:01:38
interesting it could be an interesting

01:01:40
exercise

01:01:47
and is it something like it

01:01:58
so

01:01:59
it might also

01:02:07
um

01:02:16
in different areas

01:02:18
um

01:02:30
but some was less strict and less

01:02:33
regulated and it is nowadays yeah when

01:02:36
you also when you have a city that's

01:02:38
growing that fast

01:02:39
that is having one million extra

01:02:41
inhabitants in the very short period of

01:02:45
time yeah then the city grows very

01:02:47
organically I guess and it's also very

01:02:49
hard as a planner to keep up with the

01:02:51
pace but the city is scrolling it

01:02:58
regulation

01:03:00
when exactly it was taken

01:03:02
States

01:03:09
um

01:03:10
[Music]

01:03:14
okay and can you read it

01:03:17
or not snow

01:03:21
well I will ever ever look whether I can

01:03:23
I can see

01:03:26
okay I see some comments yeah

01:03:30
in the example from China how does the

01:03:32
ownership of people with State work is

01:03:34
the city grows over these villages

01:03:37
[Music]

01:03:38
um

01:03:43
okay I will I will I will it's it's time

01:03:47
for a break

01:03:48
um I will have a look at I will have a

01:03:50
look at what I find it in public

01:03:52
that it's hard for me to check this live

01:03:56
stream that also I also need to get out

01:03:58
of PowerPoint to check that out I am

01:04:01
teaching mostly for the people here and

01:04:03
I hope that the live stream Works more

01:04:05
I'm at let's say five minutes break

01:04:09
um it's four past six on my clock here

01:04:12
so let's start again uh nine past six or

01:04:15
ten past six

01:04:20
let's see

01:04:47
what's up

01:04:52
tomorrow

01:04:58
[Music]

01:05:21
there's no difference

01:05:25
foreign

01:06:33
okay

01:07:08
thank you

01:07:37
I've jumped foreign

01:08:07
something

01:08:12
thank you

01:08:45
has heard

01:09:01
one day

01:09:49
myself

01:10:23
yes

01:10:33
[Music]

01:10:36
it is

01:10:53
let's talk

01:10:55
questions

01:11:03
let's continue

01:11:13
with the conclusion for the first uh

01:11:18
hour of the class

01:11:21
let's go through it it seems

01:11:25
that Urban differentiation the fact that

01:11:29
rich and poor little different

01:11:31
neighborhoods the fact that you have

01:11:32
people from different ethnicities

01:11:34
different generations of newcomers that

01:11:37
they live in different neighborhoods

01:11:40
somehow that seems to be some

01:11:42
characteristic of most if not all cities

01:11:45
I've been showing you models from Africa

01:11:49
Los Angeles Chicago

01:11:52
and United Kingdom

01:11:55
and I've been talking about this model

01:11:56
of the Socialist or both socialists it

01:12:00
seems that in each of these levels there

01:12:01
is this idea that different groups of

01:12:04
society whether you define them in

01:12:06
socioeconomic classes or different

01:12:08
ethnicities or

01:12:11
self-identify as a racist but these

01:12:14
different groups they have different

01:12:15
parts of a city

01:12:18
but it also seems the difference local

01:12:21
features impact upon perfect forum

01:12:24
for example this Lake in Chicago

01:12:28
and you could see that there are

01:12:29
references to the wind's Direction in

01:12:32
some of these models migration patterns

01:12:35
Etc and obviously also local policies

01:12:38
and a transport system

01:12:41
a snake intervention in housing this ID

01:12:43
for example is canceled Estates for the

01:12:46
following years

01:12:49
and restrictions of mobility in a in the

01:12:54
Chinese complex system determining where

01:12:58
uh to live or where you could set your

01:13:00
kids to school uh strategies to counter

01:13:03
policies so that also means that most of

01:13:07
these models of urban form even if they

01:13:09
say this is the model of the American

01:13:11
city that they somehow wear birthmarks

01:13:13
that they are situated in a specific

01:13:15
space

01:13:16
in a specific type of Chicago or 1920s

01:13:21
was a model of the growing city and the

01:13:24
place already 10 years later

01:13:27
and this American economy has been hit

01:13:29
by crisis this model did not fall true

01:13:32
anymore because the city was not growing

01:13:34
at that fast pace and so it's always

01:13:36
about situating these models in time and

01:13:40
space and so that also makes it

01:13:42
necessary to provincialize

01:13:45
theories so much

01:13:49
um I'd like to show you some exam

01:13:51
questions to make you think like how how

01:13:52
will I ever

01:13:55
make you

01:13:57
uh like what kind of questions could you

01:13:59
expect from this and this is a question

01:14:01
that I've asked in 2016.

01:14:04
and you have the model of the South

01:14:06
African post-apartheid City by a

01:14:09
particular author and you know how

01:14:10
familiar all of you are with this video

01:14:13
in South Africa repeal of this Advantage

01:14:16
loss

01:14:18
ES

01:14:22
and so you there are some references to

01:14:25
this Legend

01:14:26
and then I ask you which elements of

01:14:29
burgers voids and Harrison

01:14:32
do you recognize in this model boxes

01:14:38
yeah so there could be a way to check

01:14:40
whether you've understood what these

01:14:43
models are about whether you're able to

01:14:44
apply that and to another one

01:14:59
I found it in a book but I don't

01:15:01
remember

01:15:03
if you would have a look I know I do it

01:15:07
I can look it up now

01:15:12
both publicly

01:15:13
I can tell you also because

01:15:18
um

01:15:19
so first hour these classical models of

01:15:22
Earth but also some more recent

01:15:27
place with these World models

01:15:30
but I'm going to discuss now is patterns

01:15:33
of segregation

01:15:34
yeah

01:15:35
how can we look at segregation in cities

01:15:40
and I will use the definition by two

01:15:44
American Authors again Messi and mental

01:15:48
Douglas Messi and Nancy dancer to

01:15:51
American sociologists who wrote a book

01:15:54
called American apartment

01:15:56
so you see this reference to the South

01:15:58
African cities but in the thinking on

01:16:01
segregation this book has been quite

01:16:03
important

01:16:04
and so you see here what is the

01:16:06
definition

01:16:07
first of all they focus on the

01:16:09
residential segregation I could also

01:16:12
discuss segregation in Leisure spaces

01:16:15
how many people 's Force for the places

01:16:18
where people spend their Leisure Time

01:16:20
our desegregated or I could look at work

01:16:24
segregation to people of different

01:16:27
socio-economic classes meet each other

01:16:30
but most of the work on segregation

01:16:34
focuses on residential section what is

01:16:37
residential segregation it's a degree to

01:16:40
reach two or four groups however you

01:16:43
find it live separately from each other

01:16:46
in different parts of the urban

01:16:49
environment

01:16:50
adult Solutions and what you've seen in

01:16:54
these models that I've been showing you

01:16:56
in the previous hours is that in most

01:16:58
cities

01:16:59
different groups

01:17:02
whether you define them in a

01:17:06
socio-economic way

01:17:07
for in this ethnicity race

01:17:12
self-identifying

01:17:14
that indeed in all of these cities

01:17:17
different groups live in different parts

01:17:19
of the city and so in each of these

01:17:22
cities where this models are

01:17:24
right it would make sense to look at

01:17:27
residential circulation

01:17:30
but what is important is that messian

01:17:32
doesn't want to make this more complex

01:17:35
and they say most of the research on

01:17:36
segregation has been too simplistic

01:17:39
because it looked at segregation in one

01:17:41
particular way

01:17:43
and so what I'm going to do with you now

01:17:46
is to look at or discuss five dimensions

01:17:49
of segregation

01:17:51
a pharmacy and then these are called

01:17:53
evenness exposure concentration

01:17:56
centralization and clustering

01:17:59
and most of the research on segregation

01:18:01
is discussing evenness and so I will

01:18:05
also look at it what is evenness

01:18:09
evenness refers

01:18:11
and I'm just reading what you see on the

01:18:14
slide now refers to the differential

01:18:17
distribution of two social groups

01:18:20
among aerial units in a city

01:18:23
and so a minority group

01:18:26
is said to be segregated if it is

01:18:28
unevenly distributed over aerial units

01:18:32
evenness is not measured in any absolute

01:18:36
sense but is scaled relative to some

01:18:39
other group

01:18:40
so we are able to say and this city

01:18:44
this is the example that you see there

01:18:46
the lights are segregated from Plex

01:18:50
or the low socioeconomic classes if you

01:18:54
may call that same like this are

01:18:57
segregated from

01:19:00
rich is segregated from so you always

01:19:04
need these two

01:19:06
so you see here that you can have index

01:19:11
I will use this here

01:19:14
an index of this similarity can be

01:19:17
calculated and I will give you two

01:19:19
examples

01:19:22
some years this goes rather well and

01:19:24
sometimes

01:19:26
this goes rather wrong imagine that you

01:19:28
have a city that is made up of

01:19:31
four districts

01:19:32
and in each of these

01:19:35
you have 75

01:19:38
whites and 25 legs

01:19:44
what would be

01:19:46
the index

01:19:48
of this similarity when I use

01:19:52
the major layer

01:19:54
we need to paste

01:19:56
off of the sum yeah that is what this

01:20:00
great Sigma is mean and now we need to

01:20:03
for each of these neighborhoods we need

01:20:06
to say what is the black population in

01:20:08
an area

01:20:10
divided by the total black population 25

01:20:14
25 100 minus

01:20:18
75 the white population in area one

01:20:23
divided by the total white population

01:20:26
what do we have here for one

01:20:29
neighborhood

01:20:31
zero

01:20:34
I need to calculate the sum for of this

01:20:37
measure for each of these neighborhoods

01:20:39
so that will be zero plus zero plus zero

01:20:42
to zero one half of 0 is 0.

01:20:47
the index of this similarity would be

01:20:50
zero

01:20:51
or zero percent

01:20:54
this corresponds with the effect that

01:20:55
you need to move

01:20:57
zero percent

01:20:59
of the population in order to get an

01:21:01
even distribution of white and black

01:21:04
across the city because you have an even

01:21:07
distribution in each of these four

01:21:09
neighborhoods you have as many whites as

01:21:13
you have in other parts of the system

01:21:18
um you can also look at another exhaust

01:21:21
where you would have

01:21:23
100 Plex living in one neighborhood

01:21:27
100 whites in another

01:21:31
100 whites in another and another 100

01:21:33
white in another name

01:21:36
if you would make the calculation now

01:21:38
then you would get to one

01:21:41
not going to do that with you but for

01:21:43
those who

01:21:44
are able to do this this means the

01:21:46
absolute number of this so if you get to

01:21:49
a negative number here then it becomes

01:21:51
positive again when you calculate it it

01:21:54
will be

01:21:55
then the number will be one

01:21:58
yeah

01:22:01
um because you can I can still do that

01:22:03
with you there's a sum of 100 the number

01:22:07
of blacks in the first neighborhood

01:22:09
minus 100 the total number of legs minus

01:22:13
the number of whites

01:22:18
and for each node each of these

01:22:20
neighborhoods you will get uh to the

01:22:23
number

01:22:24
uh one and here you will get one third

01:22:28
one third one third total two uh half of

01:22:32
two so one meaning you need to move 100

01:22:34
of the population

01:22:36
in order to get an even distribution of

01:22:39
these population groups across the city

01:22:41
either you move

01:22:43
33 Flex

01:22:46
from this neighborhood to this

01:22:49
neighborhoods

01:22:50
yeah and then you can get if you move 33

01:22:52
to each of these then you get an even

01:22:55
distribution of blacks across the city

01:22:57
or you move all the white people through

01:22:59
that black neighborhood and then you

01:23:02
would also get to it even descriptions

01:23:03
of people across the city according to

01:23:06
this neighborhoods

01:23:07
yeah and so this index of this

01:23:09
singularity

01:23:11
ranges from zero even distribution to

01:23:15
one very uneven distinction

01:23:18
and basically it corresponds with the

01:23:20
percentage of people that you're with

01:23:22
oof in order to get an even distribution

01:23:25
of people across different neighborhoods

01:23:27
and so this may be complicated but you

01:23:30
can just look at the practice so how

01:23:33
does this look like you would get to a

01:23:35
number

01:23:36
this is this percentage

01:23:39
[Music]

01:23:40
um

01:23:41
and what you see here for example is

01:23:44
that

01:23:45
um so zero plus an even distribution

01:23:48
that was this example

01:23:51
150 uneven yeah so the more you move to

01:23:55
the right on this slide more uneven the

01:23:59
cities are so what is particular is that

01:24:02
you see that first of all American

01:24:03
cities tend to be much more penetrated

01:24:06
than European ones

01:24:09
yeah so segregation when you look at the

01:24:12
dimensions even this

01:24:15
then you find out that in American

01:24:17
cities the poor for example are living

01:24:21
much more in particular parts of the

01:24:24
city and in the European context they

01:24:26
are a bit more spread across different

01:24:29
parts of the city

01:24:30
yeah

01:24:32
and so you see here for different cities

01:24:36
for different population groups

01:24:39
you see how this has been

01:24:41
yeah and again you always need to

01:24:43
compare it with another population group

01:24:45
so what has done is the tour of ends

01:24:47
verb compared to it than the ones who

01:24:49
are not considered

01:24:52
okay and so it's also interesting for

01:24:55
those who join me to enter

01:24:57
to see that according to these

01:24:59
statistics poverty enhancer in 2005. was

01:25:04
also much more

01:25:08
unevenly spread across the city and so

01:25:11
you had particular neighborhoods where

01:25:12
you had uh

01:25:14
that were marked by poverty much more

01:25:17
than in other Europeans

01:25:19
this will also be a scale issue for

01:25:21
Belgium and we have very small

01:25:25
statistical sectors that will be part of

01:25:28
the explanation

01:25:29
scale is important when these sectors

01:25:32
grow they will mask some of the

01:25:34
concentrations of poverty of Health that

01:25:36
you've been getting the statistics are

01:25:39
defined

01:25:42
so this measure of evenness

01:25:47
some more numbers

01:25:51
again you see that

01:25:53
90 and so you get close to one

01:25:56
Birmingham Bangladesh I read there all

01:26:00
time Bangladesh

01:26:02
so apparently it is Bangladeshi in UK

01:26:06
cities

01:26:07
are living very much in particular

01:26:09
neighborhoods of the city and in these

01:26:12
neighborhoods

01:26:13
you would find almost exclusively

01:26:16
Bangladesh and that explains why you

01:26:19
would need to move almost all these

01:26:21
Bangladeshi to other neighborhoods if

01:26:23
you would like to get to an even

01:26:24
distribution of Bangladeshi in UK cities

01:26:28
and so you see how this measure is being

01:26:32
used in order to say something about

01:26:34
residential segregation in these

01:26:37
different cities

01:26:40
poverty in Copenhagen the first Quinta

01:26:45
quintile will be like the first 20 of

01:26:48
the people according to the income

01:26:51
income distribution is much less

01:26:54
segregated and it's spread much more

01:26:57
evenly across the city than it is in

01:27:00
only other cities that are listed there

01:27:04
so do you understand what this measure

01:27:06
of evenness unevenness means

01:27:12
okay I get now to these four other

01:27:14
dimensions so what messian are arguing

01:27:17
is that we have been looking at

01:27:19
segregation mostly through this lens of

01:27:21
evenness

01:27:23
there are also four other times

01:27:26
which are worthwhile looking at the

01:27:28
question I'm sorry for that example with

01:27:31
the 100 black presidents and one in this

01:27:35
record

01:27:36
I didn't think what does it

01:27:39
what does it mean for it to be one-third

01:27:42
for the for my residential conception

01:27:48
well I'm I'm just I am just for each of

01:27:52
these neighborhoods

01:27:54
I am calculating I didn't want to go too

01:27:59
much into this I am calculating this

01:28:03
and I start from the black neighborhoods

01:28:06
they're the measure or the number will

01:28:08
be 100 divided by 100 the total number

01:28:11
of likes minus net neighborhood in our

01:28:13
zero whites divided by total number of Y

01:28:16
is 300. that will be one

01:28:19
for the white neighborhoods

01:28:21
yeah and I have three of them

01:28:23
the measure will be there are zero

01:28:25
blacks and I have minus 100 the number

01:28:29
of Lights in that neighborhood divided

01:28:31
by the total number of bites 300.

01:28:34
yeah so I get here to 1 divided by three

01:28:38
so I get one plus one third one plus one

01:28:43
third plus one third two

01:28:46
two divided by two is one

01:28:50
but it doesn't say anything about its

01:28:53
neighborhoods I'm calculating something

01:28:54
at the scale of the city and for that

01:28:57
for that I need to calculate this

01:28:59
measure for these four neighborhoods

01:29:01
oh okay

01:29:04
and then I so I I think I kind of

01:29:07
realize

01:29:09
and then I need to make the Sun

01:29:13
of this number in each of these so that

01:29:16
will be some of

01:29:19
one plus

01:29:21
perspective

01:29:27
and I need to divide it

01:29:29
right

01:29:30
that's why

01:29:32
so the index of the similarity is one

01:29:35
in each this case 100 percent meaning

01:29:39
that

01:29:40
either 100 percent of flex or 100 of y's

01:29:44
need to move in order to get to an even

01:29:47
distribution of both whites and Bricks

01:29:49
across the city

01:29:54
okay

01:29:57
four other yeah

01:30:04
[Music]

01:30:21
yeah that's the percentage

01:30:24
so then this would be 100

01:30:26
and this would be zero and if the index

01:30:29
of this similarity would be 0.5

01:30:33
then you would have 50 percent

01:30:35
and that would be 50 years

01:30:38
so you move close to one and you are

01:30:41
close to

01:30:43
this is a measure that you would often

01:30:45
find

01:30:47
I could also be often

01:30:49
checked like our segregation

01:30:52
uh changing across time

01:30:55
that would be the index of the

01:30:57
similarity for first Handler has moved

01:31:00
from

01:31:01
0.40 to 0.50 meaning poor people got

01:31:05
more concentrated over time

01:31:08
for more cigarette sorry yeah

01:31:13
I got less evenly distributed across

01:31:16
five

01:31:18
okay four other

01:31:20
Dimensions I'm going to move through

01:31:23
them rather quickly

01:31:24
residential exposure reversively

01:31:28
sorry refers to the degree of potential

01:31:32
contacts

01:31:33
yeah or the possibility of interaction

01:31:37
in this case

01:31:39
in each of the neighborhoods there is a

01:31:42
similar degree of exposure here there is

01:31:45
when when these people limit their lives

01:31:47
to the neighborhood there will be no

01:31:49
exposures

01:31:51
yeah and so this degree is

01:31:53
pretty close to evenness but not

01:31:56
completely because for exposure and the

01:32:00
number will also be depending upon the

01:32:03
total size of these communities

01:32:06
if the total black population in the

01:32:09
city is very low

01:32:10
then the chances that you will get to

01:32:13
meet a black person are are lower

01:32:15
already yeah so the size of the group is

01:32:19
important if you would make a measure

01:32:20
for exposure

01:32:23
concentration Dimension number three

01:32:26
refers to the relative amount of

01:32:28
physical space occupied by a minority

01:32:31
group in the urban environment

01:32:33
this will be again be dependent upon the

01:32:36
size of this one

01:32:38
we have here Manhattan

01:32:40
and we have in these different colors

01:32:42
again these different ethnic or racial

01:32:45
groups or people self-identifying with a

01:32:48
particular group and so you see that in

01:32:52
shades of purple you have the Asian

01:32:55
population and so you have

01:32:58
China done and that's where most of

01:33:01
these Asians are concentrated they take

01:33:04
up a very small amount of space this is

01:33:08
a dense neighborhood and most Asians

01:33:11
living in Manhattan or living in that

01:33:13
particular part of an exit and so

01:33:16
concentration

01:33:18
the relative amount of physical space

01:33:20
occupied by a minority group

01:33:23
number four centralizing

01:33:28
it relates to the degree to which a

01:33:30
group is spatially located near the

01:33:33
center of an earth

01:33:35
I don't know what the center of New York

01:33:37
would be but if you say it's Wall Street

01:33:39
then these Asians are living very

01:33:43
centralized

01:33:45
and while black Africans

01:33:47
in the case of New York are not living

01:33:51
centralized

01:33:54
the same goes for this example of

01:33:56
poverty in Brussels poverty is very much

01:34:00
centralized

01:34:03
neighborhoods which are marked by

01:34:04
poverty are close to the city center

01:34:08
Parisian case poverty is very much

01:34:11
decentralized that's much more an issue

01:34:14
of this peripheral Bond years

01:34:19
and in the last Dimension is clustery

01:34:22
the degree to which is

01:34:25
um aerial units inhabited by minority

01:34:28
members and join one another or not

01:34:32
I don't know how familiar you are with

01:34:34
New York

01:34:35
but I remember walking out of the metro

01:34:38
station and Flushing close to Flushing

01:34:41
Meadows where you have the tennis

01:34:43
tournament and that was another

01:34:45
neighborhood and that was very much

01:34:48
marked by a presence of Chinese people

01:34:51
yeah so you have

01:34:54
um

01:34:54
clusters of

01:34:57
at least two clusters of Agents one in

01:35:01
this Chinatown Manhattan and then

01:35:03
another one somewhere here in Flushing

01:35:06
yeah and so is

01:35:09
um the presence of Asians is it cluster

01:35:12
no because there is two neighborhoods

01:35:16
um which are quite far away from each

01:35:18
other

01:35:22
evenness exposure

01:35:26
what was it centralization concentration

01:35:28
plus two and so I could also ask you

01:35:33
in the exam

01:35:35
to discuss

01:35:37
the three most relevant dimensions of

01:35:40
Messi and length are the ones that you

01:35:42
still remember

01:35:45
um out of these five to discuss

01:35:47
socio-economic segregation requests

01:35:51
is over the clustered or not

01:35:54
centralized

01:35:56
is it concentrated

01:35:59
or is there an evenness

01:36:01
yeah the data might allow you to say

01:36:03
something about it or not

01:36:08
um I already told you when I pointed at

01:36:11
this High numbers of unevenness in enter

01:36:15
But scale is very important

01:36:19
yeah if this is

01:36:21
a pattern of rich and poor

01:36:24
then you will only detect it as

01:36:27
segregation when you are able to study

01:36:30
it at the scale of these

01:36:33
specific neighborhoods and if your

01:36:36
statistical units are this big

01:36:39
then it would be then this would be a

01:36:41
very even when you're able to study it

01:36:44
at

01:36:45
this scale then this is a very uneven

01:36:49
and so the more refined these statistics

01:36:53
allow you to go the higher one would

01:36:56
assume these levels of segregation or

01:36:59
evenness and evenness will also be

01:37:02
so scale and the scale through which you

01:37:06
look so is something very uh important

01:37:09
as well

01:37:11
I saw a hand somewhere at the back I

01:37:13
don't know where the description is

01:37:14
still relevant yes

01:37:36
um

01:37:40
well I could imagine for example where

01:37:42
you have a CBD

01:37:45
and where do you have four neighborhoods

01:37:48
around the CBD parked by poverty

01:37:51
and you would say that poverty is

01:37:54
centralized

01:37:55
but it's not clustered

01:37:57
and it is also is it concentrated then

01:38:04
relative amount of space yeah

01:38:06
they are related to each other but

01:38:10
there's still something distinct about

01:38:12
it you could also have concentrations of

01:38:14
poverty which are very decentralized

01:38:17
I still put the poor take a very little

01:38:20
space but this is far away from the city

01:38:23
center

01:38:24
and then the question could still be

01:38:25
whether this poverty is clustered

01:38:28
whether you have in the east of the city

01:38:30
or

01:38:31
districts which are adjacents

01:38:35
to each other where is poverty is

01:38:37
concentrated or whether this poverty is

01:38:42
also decentralized

01:38:44
but also not clustered and not

01:38:47
conceptual and so you you could you

01:38:50
could imagine a

01:38:54
is centralized

01:38:57
and you would also expect it to be

01:38:59
somewhere close to it

01:39:04
or not about for for

01:39:07
groups of people in the city

01:39:18
like

01:39:19
um

01:39:24
and you would say poverty is centralized

01:39:27
in

01:39:29
the poor people are centralized in

01:39:32
Brussels rich people are not because

01:39:34
they live mostly on the periphery

01:39:55
something yeah

01:39:58
well then it will still be relevant to

01:40:00
say that

01:40:05
okay so five dimensions of segregation

01:40:07
which also allow you to speak

01:40:11
with a little bit more detail about the

01:40:13
social differentiation that you find

01:40:15
so it's not only about evenness

01:40:18
people living in different neighborhoods

01:40:21
of the city you can also discuss

01:40:23
concentration clustering centralization

01:40:26
exposure

01:40:28
you have another question sorry are you

01:40:31
starting with the confiscation

01:40:33
um does it like matter like the portion

01:40:36
like the size of the population like I

01:40:39
can imagine a city that they're just not

01:40:41
very many very few people are poor there

01:40:43
and then you could have a couple of

01:40:45
neighborhoods well and

01:40:48
it would be called concentrated but you

01:40:50
could also Imagine a situated

01:40:53
power of many people yeah I must admit

01:40:56
that I I don't know exactly how this

01:40:59
would be measured and how you would

01:41:01
operationalize such a measure but here

01:41:04
it will be about

01:41:06
like the size of the group

01:41:09
how how many Chinese do you have to be

01:41:12
about the density so they were talking

01:41:14
about the tower it will also be if they

01:41:16
take a less square meters if they live

01:41:22
um but I don't I don't know how you

01:41:23
would exactly operationalize that in

01:41:27
this kind of way

01:41:29
but for me the important thing is that

01:41:31
you understand that there are different

01:41:33
dimensions so that you can understand

01:41:34
this

01:41:35
uh spatial differentiation between rich

01:41:38
or between like

01:41:41
or between male and female or between

01:41:44
Global sexual

01:41:45
but

01:41:46
she can look at it in many different

01:41:48
ways that you would be able to study it

01:41:50
through these fine language

01:41:55
for me that's that's uh that's important

01:41:58
and I will not ask you how to measure

01:42:00
that's around to how to operationalize

01:42:02
that

01:42:03
I hope that you understand that it can

01:42:05
be meaningful

01:42:08
um to do this and that this is for

01:42:11
example uh

01:42:12
figure from the work of this festival's

01:42:15
photographer from Belgium who said well

01:42:17
you have different kinds of cities

01:42:19
topological and dramatic cities and it

01:42:22
matters whether the rich for example

01:42:24
still need to you could imagine cities

01:42:26
where rich

01:42:28
do not need to come who do not need to

01:42:31
speak to for example in the Brussels

01:42:34
case these poor neighborhoods are so

01:42:36
closely really so closely

01:42:40
um

01:42:41
located to these neighborhoods where

01:42:44
rich people work for example

01:42:46
that you will get a lot of conflicts

01:42:48
around around space but in other kinds

01:42:50
of city that would not necessarily be

01:42:52
the case yeah and so for that for that

01:42:55
reason these kind of Dimensions do

01:42:58
matter

01:43:01
and I could I could ask you to apply

01:43:03
that to a particular City

01:43:06
okay 17 minutes left to discuss the

01:43:09
causes of segregation so why is it

01:43:12
that different population groups take up

01:43:16
different parts of the city

01:43:19
I guess that all of you have

01:43:21
some kinds of ideas what could it be

01:43:24
about like what kind of explanations

01:43:27
with Uber why is it that rich and poor

01:43:30
black and white

01:43:32
Hispanic Asian people of

01:43:36
virgin people of a different class that

01:43:39
they live in a different part of the

01:43:41
city

01:43:42
why is that

01:43:44
example when it comes inspiration or

01:43:48
incoming

01:43:49
City they will often just choose the the

01:43:52
neighborhood

01:43:54
agency something that helps them find

01:43:57
work

01:44:02
system

01:44:05
around

01:44:08
for the country

01:44:15
same language

01:44:17
supermarkets or other services that are

01:44:22
created for the purpose of this

01:44:24
International

01:44:26
you have another explanation

01:44:29
I mean uh probably the difference in the

01:44:33
house and choices

01:44:36
for example infrastructure uh

01:44:43
okay so it could be about what you're

01:44:45
able to afford and the financial limits

01:44:48
that you have it could be about the

01:44:49
choice to live amongst people like you

01:44:54
as possible

01:45:05
they said that some agents don't

01:45:12
know okay

01:45:17
okay

01:45:20
um yeah

01:45:21
um there are many there are many

01:45:23
explanations and it is it is

01:45:26
uh what is important for me that I'm

01:45:29
going to try to do in a very short

01:45:31
period of time is to run through a

01:45:34
couple of typical explanations but I

01:45:36
find important is and that's why I'm

01:45:38
showing you this graph I think you've

01:45:40
seen it already in some of the previous

01:45:43
classes about Professor crosses

01:45:46
um so what is important for me is that

01:45:48
different geographers or

01:45:51
Urban thinkers or people working in the

01:45:54
domain of perfect Studies have been

01:45:56
coming up with different explanations

01:45:58
that have often it matters very much

01:46:01
from which sub-discipline

01:46:03
that you're looking at and so feminist

01:46:06
geographers have been

01:46:09
pointing at different explanations of

01:46:13
segregation then Marxist geographers

01:46:17
yeah so for that reason it is important

01:46:22
to situate these theories to explain

01:46:24
segregation

01:46:26
on this match and my take on it is that

01:46:29
one explanation is not better than the

01:46:31
other but in order to understand what is

01:46:33
happening we need to look at potential

01:46:36
limits of people and Marxist will have a

01:46:39
big theory about it and but also a

01:46:41
choice

01:46:42
and it will be mostly these

01:46:46
days

01:46:49
who are eager to explore the preferences

01:46:52
of people

01:46:53
and why people want to live in a

01:46:56
particular neighborhood and they will

01:46:57
also then

01:46:58
go to interview escape with people why

01:47:01
is it that you move

01:47:03
and so my point is I think it's

01:47:05
important that you

01:47:07
unravel these different theories made up

01:47:10
by these different thinkers from

01:47:11
different disciplines

01:47:15
um quantitative geographers in the 60s

01:47:19
were not so interested explanations of

01:47:21
segregation but they had a rich set of

01:47:24
mapping tools to understand these

01:47:27
spatial patterns

01:47:29
but they were not so interested in

01:47:31
explanations

01:47:33
ecological models Burgers she would go

01:47:37
and read Burgess 1925 concentric zone

01:47:40
model why do these different population

01:47:42
groups can look in different parts of

01:47:44
the city almost like you would have

01:47:47
these Pioneer of vegetations right

01:47:50
imagine a mute area of land first you

01:47:52
will find grass and then you would find

01:47:55
shrips and as the shrubs grow the grass

01:47:58
cannot survive anymore because there's

01:48:00
no lighting

01:48:02
for the for the grass and then you would

01:48:04
get these big trees and these shrubs can

01:48:06
also not survive so you would have

01:48:09
competition amongst different types of

01:48:13
vegetation you could have competition

01:48:14
amongst different populations

01:48:16
you would have Invasion the most desired

01:48:19
parts so we talk about ecological models

01:48:22
because when you read these

01:48:25
um 100 year old theories that often you

01:48:28
find these analogies with

01:48:31
um ecological models

01:48:33
for vegetation

01:48:35
or the survival the fittest

01:48:40
so ecological models they draw on

01:48:44
theories of expansion competition

01:48:46
Invasion succession of different

01:48:48
countries

01:48:50
technology to what you find in among

01:48:53
plants

01:48:55
for Marxist geographers different

01:48:57
neighborhoods different

01:49:01
build environments are parts of circuits

01:49:04
of capital

01:49:06
and so to understand why different

01:49:08
neighborhoods are produced for different

01:49:10
people we need to understand the flows

01:49:13
of capital David Harvey would would say

01:49:16
and

01:49:19
um the circuits in which this built

01:49:22
environment features

01:49:24
for instance I'm not going to discuss

01:49:26
this whole

01:49:28
this whole figure but for example to

01:49:31
understand

01:49:33
supervisation we also need to understand

01:49:37
the what they call from the accumulation

01:49:39
regime in which this supervisation came

01:49:43
about

01:49:44
and how for example after the second

01:49:47
world war in Belgium

01:49:48
supervisation was promoted by the state

01:49:51
also because it was a start of a

01:49:54
consumption spiral when you suburbanize

01:49:56
you need a car

01:49:58
so people will buy more cars you will

01:50:01
need a fridge because this local shop is

01:50:04
far away you will need a freezer yeah

01:50:06
and so there's a whole consumption

01:50:08
spiral that starts when people

01:50:10
suburbanize and so in order to

01:50:13
understand why supervisation of the

01:50:15
middle classes was promoted in Belgium

01:50:18
after the second world war we need to

01:50:20
understand the accumulations regime in

01:50:23
which this functions or

01:50:26
who understands why neighborhoods are

01:50:29
being gentrified to understand the

01:50:31
landscape because many of you have

01:50:33
pluses by material by clicking and as

01:50:35
well then he will explain you how this

01:50:37
rant Gap works

01:50:39
yeah so he tries to understand when you

01:50:42
when you look at gentrification through

01:50:44
a random perspective and say well the

01:50:46
fact that you have

01:50:48
an invasion now of gentrifiers to to

01:50:51
borrow this word from Burgers to

01:50:54
understand that you need to understand

01:50:56
the brand Gap and the fact that profits

01:50:58
can be made in this neighborhoods so

01:51:00
this is part of capital accumulation so

01:51:04
radical Marxist geographers will focus

01:51:06
on the fact that you have the rich in

01:51:09
the suburbs or that you have the rich in

01:51:12
this gentrifying neighborhoods they will

01:51:13
try to understand how that fits within

01:51:16
this process of capital accumulation

01:51:19
better explanation of segregation will

01:51:22
therefore be rooted in the circuits of

01:51:24
capital that's Harvey with strong

01:51:29
in the text by my campaign you will read

01:51:31
about the Neo Weber which there are more

01:51:34
constraints to people than only these

01:51:37
Financial constraints

01:51:39
it's also about discrimination it's

01:51:42
about the social capital when you have

01:51:43
how you hear about houses that

01:51:46
production etc etc and so you will read

01:51:49
about these different

01:51:51
um resources that might be important in

01:51:53
finding that way

01:51:55
and then also the constraints that link

01:51:58
to that

01:52:00
what you have there at the bottom is

01:52:03
discrimination by uh people in the real

01:52:06
estate business

01:52:07
for different population groups in

01:52:10
Belgium you see that there are some

01:52:13
significance

01:52:17
numbers

01:52:18
so it's not only about the financial

01:52:21
resources it's also about your last name

01:52:23
and whether that's Dutch or French or

01:52:26
whether that is an Arabic name that will

01:52:28
impact upon how easy it is for you to

01:52:31
find an apartment or a place to buy in

01:52:34
in Belgium

01:52:37
behavioral geographers they are

01:52:40
interested in the preferences

01:52:42
and the perceptions and the

01:52:44
decision-making of individual so for

01:52:48
them to explain

01:52:50
supervisations and the fact that these

01:52:52
middle class families move to the

01:52:54
suburbs they will think about push and

01:52:58
pull factors why do these people prefer

01:53:01
to leave the city

01:53:02
it is polluted

01:53:04
is overcrowded it's you have all the

01:53:07
grind them

01:53:09
now why are people attracted to the

01:53:13
Circuit so there are different reasons

01:53:14
for them

01:53:15
but in order to understand

01:53:18
segregation you also need to understand

01:53:20
the preferences of these different

01:53:22
populations it's not only about

01:53:25
restraints

01:53:28
it's not only about capital accumulation

01:53:30
it's also about different groups of

01:53:32
people preferring to live in different

01:53:35
kinds of environments as students will

01:53:37
also be segregated from non-students

01:53:39
because we have a certain many of you

01:53:41
will have a similar set of preferences

01:53:43
that make you not live in the suburbs I

01:53:46
guess but that will make you live closer

01:53:48
to the university and closer to places

01:53:51
where interesting things are happening

01:53:55
and then you also read in this text by

01:53:59
Ronald

01:54:01
and you also read about ethnic cultural

01:54:04
if you could also look at these

01:54:06
preferences through an ethnic lens and

01:54:08
for example

01:54:10
um to explain why

01:54:12
people of Moroccan Turkish origin in the

01:54:17
city of antwer why they live in

01:54:18
particular neighborhoods you will need

01:54:21
to understand better Financial

01:54:23
restraints many of them would be rather

01:54:26
poor and so they are forced to live in

01:54:29
in key parts of the city or cheaper

01:54:32
parts

01:54:33
but you also need to understand their

01:54:35
preferences and you can also look at

01:54:37
that through an ethnic lens and many of

01:54:39
these Moroccans will be eager to live

01:54:41
close to a mosque or to his opposed to

01:54:44
Turkish failure or close to a Halal

01:54:46
Butcher and that makes them

01:54:48
particles it could also look through

01:54:51
these preferences where you could look

01:54:54
at these preferences through an ethnic

01:54:56
list

01:54:58
use the same lens to understand why

01:55:01
more and more these Moroccan families or

01:55:04
people or families of origin also move

01:55:07
to the suburbs

01:55:08
there will might also be

01:55:10
a preference really to ethnicity for

01:55:14
example

01:55:16
um who studied this in the answer

01:55:19
context found out already quite some

01:55:22
time ago but

01:55:24
in these ethnic neighborhoods as there

01:55:26
are also being called you also have very

01:55:28
tight networks of social control

01:55:30
so to move out of these neighborhoods is

01:55:33
also too out of this to move away from

01:55:36
the social control in these areas so you

01:55:38
could have another preference that is

01:55:40
linked to this definition

01:55:45
um so the ethnic cultural approach where

01:55:47
you look at these preferences through an

01:55:49
ethnic lens and obviously it can also be

01:55:52
criticized

01:55:55
both modern geographers they will try to

01:55:57
understand how housing is important in

01:56:01
identity kind of ways in which you

01:56:04
conceptualize yourself and the meaning

01:56:07
that housing or living in a particular

01:56:09
part of the city gives to you so you see

01:56:12
here a book entitled the platform the

01:56:15
meaning of house

01:56:17
and housing is more than just a roof

01:56:20
above your head it's also about boom and

01:56:23
feeling at home

01:56:25
and so this post post-modern geographers

01:56:27
they try to understand segregation from

01:56:29
this lens and so they try to understand

01:56:32
what moving to the suburbs means or

01:56:36
these middle class people who did that

01:56:38
in this

01:56:40
was the thing to do if you had the money

01:56:42
you're reading the quote well let me

01:56:44
move to the suburbs and so this idea of

01:56:47
social Mobility

01:56:49
and showing off somehow was quite

01:56:53
important in understanding why this

01:56:56
group of people moved to the suburbs and

01:56:59
we can do the same for

01:57:02
um

01:57:03
for for why these gentrifiers

01:57:07
to move back is often set into the

01:57:09
cities it will also be about a certain

01:57:12
identity and

01:57:15
about how that gives meaning to to their

01:57:20
ideas and how they understand themselves

01:57:22
in comparison with others who then

01:57:25
living foreign

01:57:46
on these pictures

01:57:48
and to get them to live in the city

01:57:50
because it helps them

01:57:53
um to to have a tech space

01:57:55
yeah so if you want to have money to

01:57:58
spend in a city you will need in the

01:58:00
building system you will eat and

01:58:08
in the City

01:58:10
now the city council can

01:58:14
I I I'm not really making myself very

01:58:17
clear but the bottom line is that it's

01:58:19
postmodern geographers decided to

01:58:20
understand why people end up in

01:58:23
different parts of the city through the

01:58:25
lens of identity and how we identify as

01:58:29
people with the place where we live and

01:58:31
what that means for how we look at

01:58:33
ourselves and others looking in other

01:58:36
parts of the city foreign

01:59:10
[Music]

01:59:12
so I could give you another exam

01:59:15
question like look at this map here the

01:59:17
distribution of people of Turkish and

01:59:19
Moroccan origin and answer how would

01:59:22
these different geographers explain it

01:59:25
and many of the explanations that you've

01:59:27
given in the beginning of

01:59:30
when I started to talk about the course

01:59:32
of segregation have been studied by

01:59:35
these different

01:59:36
a geographers working in some

01:59:38
disciplines or people in different parts

01:59:41
of what extent called Urban studies

01:59:44
yeah of course why do we do that is

01:59:48
because we assume that this matters and

01:59:51
that segregation has effects and has

01:59:53
consequences

01:59:54
that many that people have been

01:59:58
eager to understand what does it mean

02:00:01
for a poor person to live in a

02:00:03
neighborhood that is smart Bible I mean

02:00:05
most of the other poor people living

02:00:08
around it does it matter whether you

02:00:10
live in that kind of neighborhoods or

02:00:11
whether you as a person you've been a

02:00:13
more mixtape and yet Miller classes

02:00:18
yeah or does it matter for a city

02:00:20
and when you have this segregation of

02:00:23
blacks living in a particular part of

02:00:25
the city and then why it's taking a

02:00:27
different Gap

02:00:29
or would it be better to strive for this

02:00:31
kind of more even distribution of uh of

02:00:34
blacks and whites in a particular City

02:00:36
or rich and poor or uh young people and

02:00:41
old people whatever social categories

02:00:46
so next week

02:00:49
I will not discuss patterns of

02:00:51
segregation causes of segregation but I

02:00:54
will discuss these effects

02:00:57
and also policies of social mixing that

02:01:00
are related so then we get to the heart

02:01:03
of why does it matter to to study this

02:01:06
um well is because we assume that

02:01:08
segregation of concentration

02:01:11
centralization that is at all ethics for

02:01:14
the people that we have been talking

02:01:16
about for these two hours

02:01:19
so in two weeks time

02:01:22
another class on the effects of

02:01:24
segregation next week

02:01:26
Tuesday

02:01:27
field trip to Antwerp where we will ask

02:01:29
us

02:01:30
on the field many of these issues as

02:01:33
well so I look forward to see many of

02:01:36
you in answer

02:01:38
Tuesday eight something in the in the

02:01:41
railway station

02:01:43
so see you soon

02:01:45
thank you

02:01:50
[Music]

02:01:52
thank you



# 5 Neighbourhood effects and living with diversity

00:00:03
yes

00:00:06
I've done my best now to restart the

00:00:10
stream

00:00:11
maybe you can ask whether it's it's

00:00:13
working it's difficult for me to check

00:00:17
I thought I had been doing what I've

00:00:18
been doing last week it seemed to work

00:00:20
then

00:00:21
but um also for those who use the

00:00:25
streams to to study

00:00:27
I think it makes more sense to use last

00:00:30
year's stream also for today's lecture

00:00:33
for those who are following now because

00:00:35
I I prefer to teach for the ones here

00:00:38
meaning that I will be in front of my

00:00:41
screen I should also put that on again

00:00:44
[Music]

00:00:45
um

00:00:46
or in between in the classroom and that

00:00:49
will not be recorded and last year I've

00:00:51
just been streaming from my office

00:00:53
because we were not

00:00:55
supposed to have lectures anymore so I

00:00:58
feel that it's better to

00:00:59
for all the last year's team and also

00:01:02
for the ones who can't be here today but

00:01:04
also in case you want to study the

00:01:07
slides are 1990 99 the same

00:01:11
so um I think it makes more sense to use

00:01:14
last year's live stream also for last

00:01:17
week's class

00:01:20
thank you

00:01:22
um

00:01:24
do you have any information about the

00:01:26
stream now

00:01:28
you think it's working

00:01:31
okay and I'll I'll do my best to

00:01:34
move it in that direction

00:01:38
um

00:01:39
okay so let's suppose that the stream is

00:01:41
working

00:01:42
if not everyone can rely on last year's

00:01:46
team

00:01:48
um

00:01:50
okay I think quite many of you are here

00:01:52
like I don't know how many students have

00:01:54
expected to have I think 70 or 80

00:01:56
percent this year

00:01:59
um could the ideal of social mix so I I

00:02:03
told you already I told you already that

00:02:06
in many cities across the world there

00:02:09
has been a concern with segregation it

00:02:11
has been supposed that segregation has

00:02:14
negative effects

00:02:16
on uh poor people for example and that

00:02:19
you're worse off when you're poor when

00:02:22
you're living in a neighborhood where

00:02:24
with a concentration of poverty

00:02:28
rather than in a mixed neighborhood

00:02:30
where you have both Working Class People

00:02:33
and another philosophy

00:02:37
um already in the 19th century in the

00:02:40
hey days of the Industrial Revolution

00:02:45
um you have very different groups

00:02:48
um the capitalistic bourgeoisie and the

00:02:50
utopian socialists yeah so both the

00:02:53
Bourgeois and the Socialists who were

00:02:56
afraid

00:02:58
or who were thinking that

00:03:01
um concentrations of laborers in

00:03:03
particular neighborhoods of the city for

00:03:06
example here in Brussels in modern Bay

00:03:08
at that time or an antwer in um and for

00:03:14
the good house but this would have

00:03:16
negative effects

00:03:18
and the bourgeoisie was afraid that

00:03:22
concentrations of laborers might lead to

00:03:24
Revolutions

00:03:26
that socialist thinking would become

00:03:29
dominant with these neighborhoods and

00:03:31
that you would never report that people

00:03:32
would get on the streets okay and the

00:03:36
utopian socialists they were scared that

00:03:40
um

00:03:40
this these concentrations of laborers

00:03:43
would

00:03:45
um make it more difficult to strive for

00:03:47
an egalitarian society

00:03:49
and so on both ends of the political

00:03:52
Spectrum you had people who were

00:03:54
thinking that in places such as

00:03:56
Manchester or ginto Brussels where you

00:03:58
have these new uh working class

00:04:01
neighborhoods that this was something

00:04:04
bad to be counteracted

00:04:07
this ideal is still very dominant

00:04:09
nowadays

00:04:11
and here you see a quote

00:04:13
from

00:04:15
[Music]

00:04:16
well the Brussels Capital Region quite

00:04:19
an old one but I think current policy

00:04:22
documents you would find similar quotes

00:04:24
stating that contrary to the American

00:04:27
city the ideal type for the European

00:04:30
city is based on a mix of functions and

00:04:33
people

00:04:34
I think it's important to make a

00:04:36
distinction between these two things on

00:04:38
the one hand they refer to a functional

00:04:40
mix meaning that they would like to

00:04:44
strive for neighborhoods where you have

00:04:46
a mix of the residential function

00:04:48
apartments and houses

00:04:51
and for example offices

00:04:56
or shops saying that well it's not good

00:04:59
to have neighborhoods where you only

00:05:02
have

00:05:03
a residential friction and other

00:05:05
neighborhoods where you only have

00:05:07
offices

00:05:08
and so we strive for

00:05:11
Brussels with neighborhoods where you

00:05:13
have a functional mix

00:05:15
yeah but then the other thing this is

00:05:18
what we are interested in today is

00:05:20
saying well we also want Brussels like

00:05:24
other European cities to have

00:05:27
neighborhoods with a mix of people poor

00:05:30
people and rich people

00:05:33
and in Brussels there have been many

00:05:35
different moments where this

00:05:39
this topic of social mix has been

00:05:41
agenda

00:05:43
I think those of you

00:05:45
have not arrive to vessels only a month

00:05:48
ago I might have heard of these

00:05:51
discussions around Creator books the

00:05:53
social housing Estates on my list

00:05:57
so in the periphery of the Brussels

00:06:00
Capital Region and therefore yeah quite

00:06:03
some media reports about crime

00:06:06
yeah and then the issue of well you have

00:06:09
all these

00:06:10
to be

00:06:12
accommodated on the social housing

00:06:14
estate in uh in Brussels and in Belgium

00:06:17
more generally you need to fall below a

00:06:20
certain income

00:06:22
stressful yeah meaning that it's mainly

00:06:26
the poorest of the poor that you will

00:06:28
concentrate on these social housing

00:06:30
instance

00:06:32
and so then you had discussions well is

00:06:35
that a good thing is this not leading to

00:06:37
this culture where crime is uh or common

00:06:42
and conservative politicians would raise

00:06:45
this kind of dog service

00:06:47
Progressive politicians would wonder

00:06:49
well is that then a neighborhood where

00:06:52
it is easy for poor people to climb the

00:06:55
social network wouldn't it be easier to

00:06:58
be socially mobile when you are not only

00:07:01
surrounded by other poor people but when

00:07:04
you are living between poor and rich

00:07:07
people alive

00:07:12
a neighborhood in underlift and

00:07:16
obviously also in the wake of these

00:07:19
terrorist attacks in 2015 there were a

00:07:23
lot of concerns also in the

00:07:26
international league

00:07:27
about more of me and there were reports

00:07:30
about more than make as difficult as a

00:07:33
ghetto

00:07:34
it's been looking at the statistics

00:07:37
I think

00:07:39
is the municipality most

00:07:42
people of Moroccan and origin the

00:07:46
boost followers of Islam but it's still

00:07:49
less than half

00:07:51
so in the in international media it was

00:07:54
often reported as this model made was a

00:07:57
municipality with only

00:08:00
uh

00:08:02
Moroccan

00:08:03
people and people of Moroccan Origins

00:08:06
and when you look at the statistics that

00:08:08
was not the case nonetheless

00:08:10
they were concerns hopefully but also

00:08:14
conditionally

00:08:16
um about mobile Bank being a safe haven

00:08:20
for terrorists and breeding graph or

00:08:22
there

00:08:23
are affected you have this concentration

00:08:26
of people of the same origin was

00:08:31
then the reason to be to be concerned

00:08:36
so both when it comes social Mobility

00:08:40
and when it comes to

00:08:42
cultural integration and newcomers there

00:08:46
are concerns in a city such as Brussels

00:08:50
about the concentration of either people

00:08:53
or people of foreign origin these are

00:08:56
two different issues social mobility and

00:09:00
social cultural integration and so I

00:09:03
hint was there a question

00:09:07
um

00:09:13
no I am I'm trying to explain you

00:09:16
I'm not saying that there is that these

00:09:18
are examples one is the social picks but

00:09:21
I'm trying to explain you that in many

00:09:23
cities across the roads and I will start

00:09:25
from a couple of religion examples this

00:09:27
ideal or social mix is high on the

00:09:30
political object and I'm referring to

00:09:32
this paper boss issue and modern-day

00:09:35
after the pillars the text has two

00:09:37
moments where social mixtures highly

00:09:40
debated local media and in the case of

00:09:43
these terrorist attacks also is

00:09:44
international

00:09:49
um Brussels we moved to Ghent

00:09:52
and a former colleague of mine

00:09:54
has written a nice book about

00:09:56
gentrification

00:09:58
his name is

00:10:01
so for those who know the Dutch who are

00:10:03
interested in a piece of things they

00:10:06
they find some interesting literature

00:10:08
there

00:10:08
and you see a quote from an elder man of

00:10:11
the City of Kent

00:10:13
uh talking about for those who know

00:10:16
neighborhoods such as Bridge support

00:10:20
neighborhoods that have a similar

00:10:22
history

00:10:23
as modern big in Brussels or

00:10:27
um

00:10:27
in Antwerp neighborhoods that have

00:10:31
developed in this 19th century

00:10:33
industrial industrialization

00:10:37
and

00:10:39
um so neighborhoods with

00:10:42
um

00:10:43
higher than average percentage of

00:10:46
unemployment higher than average

00:10:48
percentage of people also a higher than

00:10:51
average percentage of people of foreign

00:10:55
what was this elder man saying well when

00:10:58
I attract young families

00:11:01
preferably with a job preferably double

00:11:04
income families that will improve my

00:11:08
social tissue

00:11:09
my textbooks and my neighborhood life

00:11:15
I think these are different concerns the

00:11:17
tech space

00:11:18
is something something important I'm

00:11:21
sorry I'm in Belgium about 40 to 50

00:11:24
percent of the municipal budget comes

00:11:27
from local Texas most of it is a

00:11:30
percentage on the local income tax and

00:11:33
percentage on the

00:11:35
um on the income tax meaning that if you

00:11:38
have more rich people in your

00:11:40
municipality that you will have a higher

00:11:43
Municipal budget

00:11:46
and the other part comes from lent and

00:11:49
house value

00:11:51
um but so why does this elder man again

00:11:54
find or that attract young families

00:11:57
preferably with a joke

00:11:59
middle class of the white families is to

00:12:02
improve this local Tech space to have

00:12:05
more budget for the city of cats but on

00:12:10
top of that

00:12:11
he's saying it's also important to

00:12:13
improve my social tissue and I will go

00:12:17
further into that but often there the

00:12:20
underlying thought is that for example

00:12:24
when you have rich and poor people then

00:12:27
you have

00:12:28
families with the job and families

00:12:30
without a job that you will get diverse

00:12:32
social networks for example and then in

00:12:35
these networks jobs can be found or

00:12:38
people can be helped with homework Etc

00:12:41
and so this

00:12:43
ID for the importance to attract young

00:12:47
families prefer preferably connections

00:12:50
it's not only for to improved Tech space

00:12:54
of the city but also to improve the

00:12:57
social tissue and neighborhood life

00:13:01
in very much a similar way and we moved

00:13:04
to the city of Antwerp and we have been

00:13:07
visiting this undcredible port

00:13:10
neighborhoods the neighborhood where I

00:13:13
think 25 of the newcomers in Antwerp

00:13:16
passed through before moving to other

00:13:19
parts of the city and neighborhood that

00:13:21
is quite similar to this transition zone

00:13:23
that Burgess was describing in 19th

00:13:26
century Chicago

00:13:28
and I've been talking there about a lot

00:13:30
of regulations

00:13:31
and then affected shopkeepers in the

00:13:35
neighborhood but also

00:13:38
regulations that concern the subdivision

00:13:42
of houses

00:13:43
and you see there that in the previous

00:13:46
governance agreement in Antwerp it was

00:13:50
stated that the city wants a larger

00:13:53
share of single-family dwellings in this

00:13:57
particular neighborhood in the housing

00:13:59
Supply in order to attract families I

00:14:03
always find it interesting to see this

00:14:05
kind of words often youngsters means

00:14:08
young people or foreigners what you see

00:14:11
here is that families is used to call

00:14:13
this mantis

00:14:15
double income families often wide

00:14:19
structures so that is why the

00:14:21
transformation of single-family

00:14:23
dwellings into smaller housing entities

00:14:26
is not desirable and for those who join

00:14:29
to enter we have been discussing how

00:14:31
could you support the arrival function

00:14:33
in this neighborhood well when people

00:14:36
are looking for a very cheap place to

00:14:38
live and they will rent a room for even

00:14:41
just a mattress

00:14:43
and that's what they look for the

00:14:45
cheapest roof above their heads what you

00:14:48
see here is that the city of Antwerp is

00:14:50
not supporting the Bible version but

00:14:53
finds it important to bring another kind

00:14:57
of people uh to this neighborhood namely

00:15:00
richer families

00:15:03
so again you see efforts here

00:15:06
to

00:15:07
um

00:15:08
to earn this unto elephant North into a

00:15:11
socially mixed neighborhood where you

00:15:13
have newcomers next to uh white families

00:15:18
who can afford

00:15:21
to buy such a big house

00:15:25
just for for the use of one of one

00:15:28
family

00:15:30
in the art in the article by Tom Slater

00:15:33
and you've also seen references to

00:15:36
the situation in the UK

00:15:39
and the United States and and he refers

00:15:42
to this housing market renewal projects

00:15:46
where

00:15:48
um different in different parts of the

00:15:51
country

00:15:52
neighborhoods which were mainly

00:15:55
inhabited by poor people often poor

00:15:59
people of foreign origin you had

00:16:01
demolition projects and you had the

00:16:04
creation of new dwellings that tried to

00:16:07
cater for different audiences

00:16:11
and again you see the

00:16:14
this is a quote from the artist later

00:16:18
you see that the ID was that

00:16:21
um in these neighborhoods that have been

00:16:24
transformed uh that the inhabitants the

00:16:29
people who used to live there were

00:16:31
seriously disadvantaged by where they

00:16:34
lived and the idea was that living in

00:16:37
such a neighborhood being poor in such a

00:16:40
neighborhood

00:16:41
accessor based poverty makes it worse

00:16:46
about basically living in such a

00:16:48
neighborhood is worse than living in

00:16:50
another name

00:16:51
and that it will be more difficult to

00:16:53
find out of poverty in such a

00:16:56
neighborhood other parts of the city so

00:16:59
for this reason I was a big problem and

00:17:03
project to basically demolish much of

00:17:07
the housing in these neighborhoods and

00:17:09
to build new houses that catered for

00:17:12
different audiences

00:17:17
um Slater also refers to this hope six

00:17:20
program in the UK and the U.S sorry

00:17:23
for example Cabrini Green a neighborhood

00:17:27
a couple of miles to the north of the

00:17:29
loop in Chicago last week I've been

00:17:32
talking quite a bit about Chicago a

00:17:35
neighborhood with a very bad reputation

00:17:37
for drug use

00:17:39
and many crime and many other things

00:17:43
and again what has been done there is

00:17:45
that many of these

00:17:47
apartment books have been torn down have

00:17:50
been demolished and that

00:17:53
you houses have been built again trying

00:17:57
to cater for another kind of it's trying

00:17:59
to bring the middle class to a

00:18:02
neighborhood that was previously mainly

00:18:04
inhabited

00:18:07
and then in the separation of the PS you

00:18:10
might have heard of this function system

00:18:12
where many of the original residents of

00:18:15
the neighborhood such as that brother

00:18:17
voucher and basically to give them a

00:18:20
discount on

00:18:22
their parents price in other parts of

00:18:25
the city trying to encourage them to

00:18:28
move to better off

00:18:30
neighborhoods in other parts of Chicago

00:18:35
so again you see attempts to mix

00:18:38
neighborhoods

00:18:40
in the conviction that the concentration

00:18:43
of poverty is bad that it leads to crime

00:18:47
and it leads to drug use and that it is

00:18:51
bad for these inhabitants

00:18:54
South Africa

00:18:56
yeah

00:19:02
well I think the outcome

00:19:04
um

00:19:05
there are many many papers about this

00:19:07
and many scholars are looking at

00:19:09
different sites of this metal

00:19:12
but

00:19:13
um

00:19:14
I think in the article by Tom Slater and

00:19:17
page

00:19:18
369 I see here it is stated that No

00:19:23
Effects have been reported for a number

00:19:25
of outcomes

00:19:27
and that adverse effects on the delete

00:19:30
delinquency

00:19:32
and physical health of

00:19:34
um adolescent males in particular have

00:19:37
been reported

00:19:39
um but positive effects on adult mental

00:19:41
health and education and health of young

00:19:43
women so it depends very much

00:19:46
what you're looking at

00:19:48
but in any case

00:19:49
studies who tried and to find out like

00:19:52
what happened to the people who moved to

00:19:54
middle class neighborhoods and found

00:19:57
fairly adverse effects and in any case

00:20:00
one good question whether such a

00:20:04
well because the

00:20:06
project

00:20:08
was the best one to try and improve the

00:20:12
situation of poor people in Chicago

00:20:15
yeah

00:20:17
I will discuss the the effects of such

00:20:19
programs in more detail but before doing

00:20:22
that I wanted to highlight that in many

00:20:24
countries across the world us UK many

00:20:27
Belgian cities

00:20:28
and basically all over Western Europe in

00:20:31
South Africa

00:20:33
attends have been made to create

00:20:36
socially mixed neighborhoods in the

00:20:38
conviction that's a segregation as a

00:20:41
concentration of poverty is bad for

00:20:44
people living in uh

00:20:46
foreign

00:21:14
[Music]

00:21:16
of projects that you see here are about

00:21:19
bringing the middle class to

00:21:22
neighborhoods which used to be uh

00:21:25
predominantly predominantly

00:21:27
dysfunction program that I was just

00:21:30
talking about is also doing the other

00:21:33
way in doing it the other way around

00:21:34
because it tries to bring poor people

00:21:37
um to middle class neighborhoods so this

00:21:40
is also a project where

00:21:43
middle class neighborhoods are also

00:21:45
becoming more more mixed

00:21:47
because by giving these rent subsidies

00:21:49
through this voucher system it allows

00:21:53
people

00:21:54
underprivileged people to move to a

00:21:57
better of parts of the city as well

00:22:00
but I will I will come back to that

00:22:03
um

00:22:03
for now

00:22:05
well

00:22:06
we it's good that you already started

00:22:09
wondering about every

00:22:11
ethical difference

00:22:12
but as I said for now it's it's

00:22:14
important that you see that

00:22:16
in many parts in many corners of the

00:22:19
world this

00:22:20
um ideal of socially mixed socially

00:22:24
mixed neighborhoods seems to be a very

00:22:28
stable kind of idea

00:22:30
and it's very predominant among policy

00:22:34
makers both on the left and on the right

00:22:38
so on both ends of the political

00:22:40
Spectrum you find this pretty poor

00:22:44
neighborhoods that house people of

00:22:47
different origins or people of different

00:22:50
socio-economic efforts

00:22:53
two questions we need to ask about this

00:22:56
is it possible then to create social

00:22:59
indexed mixed neighborhoods and then

00:23:02
third and is it or second the second

00:23:05
question is it a desirable to do that

00:23:11
and

00:23:13
the article white illustrator gives or

00:23:16
turns later gives in this article a very

00:23:19
clear answer

00:23:20
referring to this whole six

00:23:24
program in the United States and housing

00:23:27
markets renewal in the UK is stating

00:23:31
that what have they done they have

00:23:32
basically just shifted over the

00:23:34
elsewhere this has not been a remedy to

00:23:37
Poverty this has just made poor people

00:23:40
elsewhere in the city

00:23:43
the mode of production that shapes Urban

00:23:46
environments which we live

00:23:49
it's referring to the capitalistic

00:23:51
system there the system of the the mode

00:23:55
of production of capitalism

00:23:57
produces concentrations of poverty that

00:24:01
many

00:24:02
policy makers as we have seen rejoice in

00:24:06
breaking up yet that same mode of

00:24:09
production churning intact produces

00:24:13
further concentrations just down the

00:24:16
street

00:24:17
I still remember one of my former

00:24:21
professors saying that well many of

00:24:23
these attempts to create socially mixed

00:24:26
neighborhoods by attracting middle class

00:24:29
people

00:24:30
to

00:24:32
for example poor neighborhoods

00:24:35
in Brussels has just shifted this

00:24:37
poverty elsewhere and for that reason he

00:24:41
um

00:24:42
he made this comparison with moving

00:24:45
chairs on the deck of the Titanic people

00:24:48
remain poor that you just make them move

00:24:51
somewhere else but this does not

00:24:54
improve their socio-economic position

00:24:56
this does not help them to climb to

00:24:59
social media in in the text 5 and again

00:25:02
all you've also also seen this reference

00:25:05
to water but

00:25:07
oops

00:25:10
so when you look at that

00:25:12
um it it seems to be very hard to create

00:25:15
a social mix

00:25:17
yeah the same goes for Brussels I've

00:25:20
been referring to this article by

00:25:23
material by clicking already in chapter

00:25:26
one

00:25:28
um and basically what mature has been

00:25:31
doing is to study people moving out of

00:25:35
gentrifying neighborhoods in bristles

00:25:37
what happens to people who move out of

00:25:41
neighborhoods in Brussels that are

00:25:44
gentrified

00:25:45
and basically he made a distinction

00:25:48
between different clusters of people and

00:25:51
if I'm correct then cluster one

00:25:54
consisted mainly of Highly Educated

00:25:57
young professionals where do they move

00:26:00
as neighborhoods in Brussels gentrified

00:26:02
they move to Antwerp and Yash and also

00:26:07
some of the municipalities of rabba one

00:26:10
law and these are municipalities

00:26:13
these people find a joke in another city

00:26:16
in another part of Belgium they move out

00:26:18
of this gentrifying neighborhoods and

00:26:20
they

00:26:21
move to a place closer to the place

00:26:23
where they cook and that's where it is

00:26:26
cluster two

00:26:28
consisted of more working philosophy

00:26:32
last people with a lower than average

00:26:34
income where do they move

00:26:37
first of all to

00:26:40
um

00:26:42
well municipalities along the canal

00:26:46
and such as Holland and hillford

00:26:49
I don't know how familiar all of you are

00:26:52
with the geography of Belgium already

00:26:54
but these are also municipalities small

00:26:57
towns that have gone through a process

00:26:59
of industrialization and where you will

00:27:01
find small houses that will be cheaper

00:27:03
than the houses you would find in these

00:27:06
gentrified team records in Brussels yeah

00:27:09
so what you see here is that

00:27:11
gentrification comes with displacement

00:27:14
for example through a municipality such

00:27:17
as Villanova

00:27:19
but as you see these clusters you can

00:27:22
find rather far from Brussels

00:27:30
many

00:27:32
towns cities in this 19th century built

00:27:37
of industrialization in person in

00:27:40
Belgium so these are municipalities

00:27:42
where you would find housing or a rather

00:27:46
cheap price

00:27:48
yeah so if you follow material by

00:27:51
clicking his arguments then you would

00:27:53
see well what happens here is that by

00:27:56
trying to improve

00:28:00
the lives of poor people in Brussels

00:28:03
through creating the social mix

00:28:06
attracting the middle class to these

00:28:09
neighborhoods what you see is that these

00:28:11
people move

00:28:14
are displaced to other municipalities

00:28:17
they also have concentrations of poor

00:28:22
people that but they are located in much

00:28:26
worse situations locations when it comes

00:28:29
to finding a job

00:28:32
and so what is happening here this is

00:28:35
Shifting the chairs on the deck of the

00:28:37
Titanic poverty still exists but by

00:28:41
attracting the middle class to some

00:28:43
neighborhoods or Brussels you move

00:28:45
poverty elsewhere

00:28:47
to places where people can afford to

00:28:50
live

00:28:51
and these are

00:28:53
neighborhoods that we have been visiting

00:28:55
in inshallah for example

00:28:58
where buying a house or renting an

00:29:01
apartment will be much cheaper than at

00:29:04
least in in section or some of the other

00:29:08
gentrifying parts of Brussels

00:29:12
this map shows something very similar

00:29:15
for Android

00:29:17
those who join to antler might recognize

00:29:20
its first ring the medieval answer the

00:29:24
second ring

00:29:26
19th century industrial antler

00:29:30
um and what it what is not

00:29:33
um

00:29:35
visualizes is a synthesis index of this

00:29:39
advantage and you see that in some

00:29:41
neighborhoods there are no big changes

00:29:44
uh in the last years in this index they

00:29:47
are yellow

00:29:48
for example Louis ball

00:29:50
social housing Estates that we have

00:29:53
visited remains yellow situation there

00:29:55
does not really change

00:29:57
you also see other parts of the city

00:30:00
for example a luncheon

00:30:03
at the area around the museum that we

00:30:06
have been growing up

00:30:08
you see that this is blue yeah and many

00:30:11
of the inner city neighborhoods in

00:30:15
entrepreneurs for example are also blue

00:30:18
yeah

00:30:20
at the same time you see that other

00:30:22
parts of the city for example medicine

00:30:27
outside of this 19th century well that

00:30:30
you see a worsening of the synthesis

00:30:33
that's also here through this map you

00:30:37
could see that well some neighborhoods

00:30:40
are attracting or middle class people

00:30:42
but poverty is shifted elsewhere in the

00:30:46
city is moving to other parts of the

00:30:49
urban region and this map is just uh

00:30:52
giving you the situation for the

00:30:54
municipality of the city of Antwerp but

00:30:57
if you would include the whole province

00:30:59
of that or you might see that for

00:31:02
example

00:31:03
for people who know culture

00:31:06
um

00:31:08
the Drupal region

00:31:11
we have display factories factors in the

00:31:14
past that you would see a worsening of

00:31:16
the situation

00:31:18
so we can try to attract middle class

00:31:21
people that's what the city of Ventura

00:31:23
Pacific building you can try to attract

00:31:25
the middle classes back to the city

00:31:28
but this displaces

00:31:32
people from these neighborhoods who

00:31:34
cannot afford to live there anymore so

00:31:36
this moves over the elsewhere

00:31:40
Russian

00:31:48
well I I'm a submitted I don't know all

00:31:51
the applications in this in the specific

00:31:53
index but I guess it will be about

00:31:56
average income

00:31:58
unemployment and maybe some other

00:32:01
complicators that say something about

00:32:03
this thing

00:32:07
um but I should have I should have put

00:32:11
so much of what we see here

00:32:14
confirms this ID of Slater when clicking

00:32:17
in that well trying to create a social

00:32:19
mix in some parts of the city will

00:32:24
shift poverty will make poverty move

00:32:27
elsewhere I will create

00:32:30
that's what Slater said will create

00:32:33
other concentrations

00:32:35
of poverty this is just down the street

00:32:39
inshallahua for the case of this

00:32:42
gentrifying neighborhoods Over Us in

00:32:44
bone for This Ginger flying so that's

00:32:47
verb in medicine in government in other

00:32:50
parts of these Urban regions

00:32:55
there are examples in the world where

00:32:59
mixed neighborhoods are being created

00:33:02
but that is only possible

00:33:04
when City councils or governments can

00:33:09
have a serious impact

00:33:11
open

00:33:14
upon who's living in in specific

00:33:17
neighborhoods

00:33:19
um in some parts of the world

00:33:23
um Scholars write about inclusionary

00:33:26
housing or inclusionary zoning

00:33:30
forcing for example real estate

00:33:32
developers who develop a high tower full

00:33:36
of apartments

00:33:37
to

00:33:39
um

00:33:40
dedicates a certain percentage of these

00:33:43
residents residential units to people

00:33:47
who fall below a certain income

00:33:49
threshold

00:33:50
and so you can create

00:33:53
a socially mixed neighborhood

00:33:56
if you force

00:33:59
real estate Developers

00:34:01
to

00:34:03
um

00:34:04
well in in newly built projects

00:34:07
to have a certain percentage of

00:34:11
Apartments of for people of a certain if

00:34:16
they fall below a certain inconsistent

00:34:19
in Antwerp I've been talking about this

00:34:21
caltex neighborhood

00:34:23
this was the length of the port in

00:34:26
public hands and so the city council

00:34:30
could also sell this land to Developers

00:34:34
with a lot of conditions and so

00:34:37
developers could buy this lens under the

00:34:41
condition that's that they built 25 of

00:34:46
the residential units for social housing

00:34:48
15 rent 10 to buy and that they

00:34:55
reserved 50 of the units at affordable

00:34:59
prices

00:35:00
and that was not fairly affordable but

00:35:03
at least you could not ask whatever you

00:35:05
wanted these prices could not Skyrocket

00:35:08
could not ask whatever you wanted for

00:35:11
these residential units and so you could

00:35:14
argue a socially mixed neighborhood has

00:35:16
been developed here almost from scratch

00:35:20
there's all these white blocks that you

00:35:23
see here are new and only the brown ones

00:35:25
existed but that was possible because

00:35:28
the lens was publicly owned and could be

00:35:31
sold to developers under the condition

00:35:33
that they reserved this kind of uh

00:35:38
units for certain categories of people

00:35:41
and then we could look who is able to

00:35:44
rent or buy these units well in the belt

00:35:48
in case you need to fall below a certain

00:35:50
income at thresholds in order to be able

00:35:53
to eligible to be eligible for a social

00:35:57
housing

00:35:58
yeah the same goes for this

00:36:01
affordability

00:36:04
um criteria

00:36:06
um I don't know what how what was the

00:36:07
price exactly but I see here that um you

00:36:11
could earn up to 58 000 Euro of family

00:36:14
uh almost 4 000 Euro added for each

00:36:18
additional person so these are quite

00:36:20
uh quite High I think already but the

00:36:24
bottom line is that these developers

00:36:26
could not just build whatever they

00:36:28
wanted

00:36:30
that they needed to meet certain

00:36:31
criteria and that they also needed to

00:36:33
reserve quite a bit of number of units

00:36:36
for people

00:36:38
belong to different income computers

00:36:41
at the lowest income categories social

00:36:44
housing

00:36:48
so associately mixed neighborhoods when

00:36:52
it comes to Green goals yeah when it

00:36:54
comes to poverty and wealth could be

00:36:56
created but that was only possible

00:36:59
because there was a serious intervention

00:37:02
of the city council

00:37:04
in in this in Belgium

00:37:09
the the government or public authorities

00:37:12
are not really able to intervene that

00:37:14
much in terms because it's only laser

00:37:18
flop there's six percent of the units

00:37:21
which are social housing in Brussels are

00:37:24
10 and all the rest

00:37:28
um with a couple of exceptions minor

00:37:30
exceptions all the risk is the market

00:37:32
it's either people's own house or people

00:37:36
who rent a house from another office

00:37:40
but there are cities across the world

00:37:42
where you have 50 social housing okay

00:37:45
enough for example or Amsterdam is

00:37:49
another city a high percentage

00:37:52
it also means that as a council you can

00:37:55
intervene quite a bit the rule is where

00:37:58
in the Belgian case where

00:38:00
about 90 of the people need to find a

00:38:03
house or accommodation on the market you

00:38:07
will see that attempts to create a

00:38:09
social mix quickly lead to displacement

00:38:12
and quickly lead to concentrations of

00:38:14
poverty elsewhere in uh

00:38:22
particular house mix looks like and how

00:38:25
much facility councils can intervene in

00:38:28
in the house

00:38:31
um

00:38:44
there has been a time when the social

00:38:47
Housing Association sold kind of quite

00:38:50
some units

00:38:55
in any case there's a little bit of

00:38:56
Courage

00:38:59
and this type of models are attractive

00:39:03
for the developers right this question

00:39:05
about like I would think developers are

00:39:08
thinking about profits yeah as long as

00:39:11
they as long as they can still make

00:39:12
profits this is possible

00:39:15
and the same goes for this inclusionary

00:39:18
housing as long as a developer is able

00:39:21
to

00:39:21
make profits then this is awesome

00:39:26
in this case I don't think that the

00:39:29
developer said to pay a lot of money for

00:39:31
the city to get this piece of

00:39:34
them and because they were also asked to

00:39:39
because they had to develop the parts

00:39:41
and the streets

00:39:43
and they had to take there to develop

00:39:46
this social housing

00:39:48
so the city could have earned much more

00:39:51
money by selling this piece of land for

00:39:53
the highest price to a developer who

00:39:55
wanted to build a Sparkles for the

00:39:57
wealthiest of people that shows to do

00:40:00
things different

00:40:01
and there are many parts of the world

00:40:03
where we have these kind of schemes

00:40:21
hello

00:40:27
um

00:40:31
okay is social mix feasible the answer

00:40:35
is yes

00:40:36
it is feasible it is possible to create

00:40:39
socially mixed neighborhoods but it is

00:40:42
very hard to do that in a situation

00:40:44
where the market rings

00:40:47
because then

00:40:49
trying to attract middle class families

00:40:51
to a poor neighborhood will lead to

00:40:54
displacement of poor families to other

00:40:56
parts of the urban region in this case

00:40:59
that will not happen because you reserve

00:41:02
25 of the neighborhood to people who

00:41:07
fall below the certificate

00:41:10
and as long as these units are social

00:41:13
housing is 25 will remain there for this

00:41:18
population

00:41:19
and so you

00:41:21
allow

00:41:22
for people to live

00:41:25
in a neighborhood

00:41:27
where

00:41:29

00:41:30
belongs to middle class for the upper

00:41:33
middle class at 25 percent

00:41:37
um hope these units goes to very rich

00:41:39
people who can afford to spend one

00:41:41
million euros

00:41:44
another question

00:41:48
and like this could be like

00:41:51
social takes early in this one

00:41:53
particularly

00:41:54
radius area in the city but then

00:41:58
wouldn't this be like our classic

00:42:00
example actually should wear like um

00:42:02
capital is being

00:42:04
for illness because even I mean just

00:42:06
from experiences your housing I don't

00:42:09
know

00:42:10
example usually these are like very

00:42:13
up-to-date luxury buildings and um there

00:42:17
are so affordable and social housing

00:42:20
however this then changes

00:42:26
so it might there might be different

00:42:31
but then the general effect would

00:42:34
actually

00:42:35
benefit

00:42:37
development

00:42:41
found it not like actually the people

00:42:44
who are living there beforehand and

00:42:46
maybe have to preserve it

00:42:49
um

00:42:54
but I think in this case you talk about

00:42:56
people who lived there we're just

00:42:58
understand already that was not so much

00:43:01
the case here because you only had a

00:43:02
couple of hundreds people you developed

00:43:04
a neighborhood for thousands of people

00:43:07
um it was a neighborhood that was uh

00:43:09
more to related I was not so much

00:43:15
put in this

00:43:17
wouldn't this just be another example of

00:43:20
gentrification

00:43:22
and not really attempting to solve

00:43:28
or trying to

00:43:31
purchases

00:43:40
but like is it it depends how you how

00:43:42
you define it

00:43:44
also you would say gentrification comes

00:43:46
with displacement and displacement would

00:43:49
be an essential part of gentrification

00:43:52
in this case

00:43:54
there might be a displacement of the

00:43:57
people who lived in these brown houses

00:44:01
and will live there already

00:44:03
before the rest of the neighborhood

00:44:05
before the white parts of the main route

00:44:07
were being constructed

00:44:10
but there will not be a displacement in

00:44:14
this 25 units which are either rented

00:44:18
out or sold as social house because you

00:44:21
will need to fall below a certain

00:44:23
incompatible in order to buy or rent

00:44:26
these places and no matter what happens

00:44:29
in the rest of the neighborhood as

00:44:31
humans will still remain

00:44:35
reserved for people probably not

00:44:38
income threshold so this is a way to

00:44:41
make sure that this place

00:44:44
even if you buy this kind of

00:44:46
so you will not be able to sell them

00:44:49
and if you rent them out

00:44:52
then this is also under the condition

00:44:54
that fall below the circle

00:45:05
everything else

00:45:08
as this whole area has been gentrified

00:45:11
there has been urban renewal in this

00:45:12
whole area so it's only in this very

00:45:15
small part where you they were able to

00:45:17
create the social studies

00:45:21
yeah yeah one important thing is the

00:45:25
scale the scale at which we discuss

00:45:27
things that we are talking about a very

00:45:29
small scale the neighborhood of a couple

00:45:32
of thousand people but indeed if you

00:45:34
discuss it at a scale of Antwerp then

00:45:37
you would see that this whole area

00:45:39
around this red square that we've just

00:45:43
been talking about has been going

00:45:45
through an improvement of this

00:45:48
disadvantaged index and has been going

00:45:51
through a very very

00:45:53
strong gentrification sorry that's

00:45:57
you're completely just a very fair

00:45:59
cooler I'm sorry but then I'm just

00:46:03
curious how it works here like

00:46:05
um

00:46:07
developers can get

00:46:08
tactics or like benefits from the garden

00:46:10
for providing sir

00:46:12
called public housing because that's how

00:46:13
it works

00:46:15
well I don't know about these these tax

00:46:17
rebates but for sure the lens price for

00:46:20
which they were able to acquire this

00:46:23
well the price for which they were able

00:46:25
to

00:46:26
buy this piece of land from city council

00:46:29
was much lower than it would have been

00:46:33
just a market with a gate

00:46:37
okay is it is it

00:46:40
yeah yeah more questions

00:46:52
but um I know

00:47:05
okay now we move to the next question is

00:47:08
it then good or bad is it desirable to

00:47:12
create such a neighbor now what you say

00:47:14
is that well the kind of shops that you

00:47:17
find

00:47:18
the most dictators for the meats and the

00:47:22
desires of this 75 percent of residents

00:47:26
and a lot of tourists and visitors who

00:47:29
like to visit that part of the city

00:47:32
and so that could be a reason to say

00:47:34
well it's not desirable to do this

00:47:37
because these people will not find cheap

00:47:39
food in the area or the kind of

00:47:43
a product statement like they would like

00:47:45
to buy but that shows that we are moving

00:47:48
to uh the next question

00:47:50
is social mix uh

00:47:54
and I guess it would be time for a break

00:47:57
I'm running a bit behind schedule

00:48:00
I'm wondering there is a three-hour

00:48:03
and three hours are dedicated to

00:48:07
urban geography last week I've been

00:48:10
limiting my last two hours would it be a

00:48:13
big problem if I would go if it's over

00:48:15
these two hours of course

00:48:20
okay I'll I'll just go through the

00:48:23
slides and

00:48:24
we'll see we'll see uh what time what

00:48:27
time but I think it's better to have a

00:48:29
break now before moving to this next

00:48:31
question is it desirable create this uh

00:48:36
five minutes and then we continue

00:48:52
[Music]

00:49:12
thank you

00:49:13
[Music]

00:49:22
very random questions

00:49:50
thank you

00:50:14
yes

00:50:25
thank you

00:50:50
uh

00:50:52
questions

00:51:21
anyways

00:51:27
there is

00:51:29
Paris

00:52:06
thank you

00:52:26
thank you

00:52:31
thank you

00:52:49
um

00:53:02
[Music]

00:53:12
thank you

00:53:41
questions

00:54:11
thank you

00:54:24
thank you

00:54:36
is it

00:54:40
maybe I should have known this earlier

00:54:47
so let's continue with this uh in the

00:54:51
next question my social mixed desire

00:54:59
I think I might need to skip question

00:55:03
number four

00:55:05
um or part number four and in any case I

00:55:08
believe it's time to uh

00:55:10
to go into the arguments here

00:55:15
um

00:55:15
sure the overarching Assumption amongst

00:55:20
policy makers

00:55:21
and also the dominant hypothesis amongst

00:55:25
researchers

00:55:27
seems to be that where you live

00:55:30
affects your life chances

00:55:33
yeah whether you live in Antwerp

00:55:37
in this line blocking

00:55:40
this social housing estate believe

00:55:44
or whether you live as a poor person in

00:55:48
alternate North where you have all these

00:55:51
shops

00:55:53
and ethnic bars and you have

00:55:57
employment close by Etc

00:56:00
that makes a difference

00:56:02
yeah so the basic question

00:56:05
of researchers has been can impoverished

00:56:08
neighborhoods neighborhoods with a

00:56:11
concentration of poverty can they make

00:56:14
their residents worse

00:56:20
because

00:56:21
maybe two observations before our look

00:56:24
into the different arguments the

00:56:27
different

00:56:28
ways in which this question has been

00:56:31
answered

00:56:32
observation number one is that

00:56:34
researchers

00:56:36
working in different sub-disciplines

00:56:39
I've been showing you this diagram last

00:56:42
week already

00:56:43
research is working in different

00:56:45
sub-disciplines of human geography or

00:56:48
Urban studies more broadly have been

00:56:51
answering this question differently

00:56:54
and where would you position translator

00:56:56
on the map

00:56:58
what kind of Joker is he

00:57:02
do you have an ID

00:57:04
Marxist geographer writing about the

00:57:07
capitalistic moment of production

00:57:09
and he's a Marxist geographer

00:57:12
and he's mainly interested in

00:57:16
socio-economic

00:57:19
issues

00:57:20
yeah

00:57:21
what happens to poor people when they

00:57:24
live in a poor neighborhood

00:57:25
other geographers have been asking

00:57:28
different researchers for example

00:57:30
relating to ethnicultural

00:57:33
segregation as of all article wide by

00:57:37
for example deals with

00:57:40
ethnic segregation

00:57:42
and not with social economic signage

00:57:46
a Marxist geographer such as Tom Slater

00:57:48
will be interested in

00:57:51
socio-economic segregation where the

00:57:54
poor and rich people live and is that

00:57:56
meaningful

00:57:58
in the eradication of poverty for

00:58:00
example

00:58:00
so you see the different geographers

00:58:03
have been asking different research

00:58:06
questions when it comes to these effects

00:58:09
of segregation

00:58:10
they have also been using different

00:58:12
research methodologies

00:58:14
we use large service they have a survey

00:58:19
of 1 000 people in order to answer these

00:58:23
questions or do you have qualitative

00:58:25
research where you interviewed 30

00:58:27
families

00:58:29
number 13 30 people living in a

00:58:32
neighborhood or displaced from looking

00:58:34
so different research methodologies and

00:58:37
then you've also been reading

00:58:41
that there might also be different

00:58:44
ideological underpinnings

00:58:47
uh underlying the work of these

00:58:49
different so I think it is important for

00:58:52
you to understand that just like I

00:58:54
argued last week for the causes of

00:58:57
segregation and the different arguments

00:59:00
that have been

00:59:01
even for why people live

00:59:04
in segregated neighborhoods but also

00:59:07
when it comes to these effects of

00:59:09
segregation and the broad literature

00:59:11
around it the people working in

00:59:14
different positions and different

00:59:15
sub-disciplines of human geography

00:59:18
geography have been giving different

00:59:21
answers to these questions

00:59:26
another remark

00:59:28
that I want to give before going to the

00:59:31
answers to that question is that it is

00:59:34
important

00:59:36
to see that studies on neighborhood

00:59:39
affects their birth marks what do I mean

00:59:44
with it is that it matters rare a study

00:59:48
takes place and often for example

00:59:51
literature of the effects of segregation

00:59:55
studies conducted in the United States

00:59:58
that the conclusions of these studies

01:00:01
have been used for example to influence

01:00:03
policy in Western Europe

01:00:06
and while it is

01:00:08
quite important to see the differences

01:00:11
between these different contexts last

01:00:13
week I have been highlighting for

01:00:15
example that and when it comes to

01:00:18
desegregation in dishes and it turns out

01:00:21
that segregation in the United States is

01:00:24
much stronger more prevalent than it is

01:00:27
in Europe

01:00:28
yeah so that's an important difference

01:00:30
when you take the conclusions from one

01:00:33
country to the other

01:00:35
the welfare states in Western Europe has

01:00:38
been much more developed than in the

01:00:41
United States so when it comes to

01:00:43
poverty and the eradication of poverty

01:00:45
this is a completely different issue in

01:00:48
a western European context than a disc

01:00:50
major Latin America

01:00:53
so it's important

01:00:56
that you contextualize studies on

01:01:00
segregation in the United States for

01:01:02
example and then you just do not

01:01:04
transfer these conclusions to

01:01:08
to Europe

01:01:10
many of the

01:01:13
um

01:01:15
studies on neighborhood effects and the

01:01:18
effects of segregation have been

01:01:20
conducted in the Netherlands and also

01:01:23
this Dutch context is a very peculiar

01:01:25
way

01:01:27
and where for example concerns about the

01:01:31
bailiff that's what you see there a

01:01:33
particular neighborhood in Amsterdam

01:01:36
have been quite important in stimulating

01:01:39
This research field

01:01:41
I'm doing for time

01:01:47
but this far right politicians in the

01:01:50
Netherlands have always been brother but

01:01:51
for two decades already have been a very

01:01:54
vulgar yeah and that's also important to

01:01:57
understand why and this research field

01:02:00
has been sort of developed in the

01:02:02
Netherlands so important to

01:02:05
provincialize distance and to understand

01:02:07
that a study in Vienna or in Antwerp or

01:02:11
in Brussels or in the United States that

01:02:14
it's important to contextualize and to

01:02:17
understand the specificities of this

01:02:19
particular context

01:02:22
I have seven answers to this question I

01:02:27
remember the question can impoverished

01:02:30
neighborhoods make their residence worse

01:02:32
off or when I'm interested in ethnic

01:02:35
cultural segregation and neighborhoods

01:02:38
with the concentration of uh people for

01:02:41
origin make integration more difficult

01:02:46
yeah

01:02:48
um

01:02:50
seven different arguments the first one

01:02:53
The Social Network archives I think many

01:02:57
of you might have heard of the work of

01:02:59
Robert Putnam

01:03:00
focusing on social capital or the social

01:03:03
capital the connections among

01:03:05
individuals the social networks the

01:03:08
Norms of reciprocity reciprocity and

01:03:11
trustworthiness that arise from

01:03:14
making a distinction between owning

01:03:17
Capital what is bombing Capital these

01:03:20
are social networks connections Norms of

01:03:23
reciprocity between socially homogeneous

01:03:26
people for example people of the same

01:03:29
ethnicity are people of the same social

01:03:32
and economic group

01:03:34
distinction between bonding and

01:03:36
breaching and approaching Capital being

01:03:39
actions networks launch of reciprocity

01:03:42
and trustworthiness during socially

01:03:45
heterogeneous

01:03:46
for example people of different

01:03:48
ethnicities

01:03:49
are people of different social economics

01:03:53
and the argument is often that reaching

01:03:56
capital is important for social Mobility

01:04:00
yeah for example if you're poor

01:04:03
from your middle class neighbor you will

01:04:08
get to hear about jobs

01:04:10
and it is a person who's working I mean

01:04:13
there is a job opportunity in the office

01:04:15
where this person learns he might share

01:04:17
this knowledge that she might share it

01:04:19
with is for her name

01:04:22
to work and when you do not speak Dutch

01:04:26
it might be good to have this white

01:04:28
middle class family this Empire City

01:04:31
Council was so interested in living next

01:04:33
to you because you maybe they can help

01:04:36
yourself or daughter with homework

01:04:40
um as they Stitch and so these are the

01:04:42
IDS behind this argument saying that

01:04:46
well it's good

01:04:48
to have mixed neighborhoods because

01:04:50
these mixed neighborhoods will lead to

01:04:54
heterogeneous networks they will lead to

01:04:56
breaching capital and that will be

01:04:59
important that will be to the benefits

01:05:01
of poor people living in such a

01:05:04
neighborhood

01:05:05
and so one reason why you would want to

01:05:08
create a socialist neighborhood is

01:05:11
because you want to create heterogeneous

01:05:13
social networks because you assume that

01:05:16
bridging Capital will help poor people

01:05:20
to be socially mobile and to join them

01:05:23
to for example through education or true

01:05:27
choice

01:05:28
and so this is one of the seven

01:05:30
arguments

01:05:32
that underpins this ideal of social mix

01:05:37
but when we study how people live

01:05:41
it turns out that

01:05:44
people are rather Mobile in a city do

01:05:47
not limit their lives to a particular

01:05:49
neighborhood

01:05:50
and that many of the social networks

01:05:53
that develop in a neighborhood spend

01:05:55
different neighborhood borders and this

01:05:58
is a study from

01:06:00
in China looking at the social networks

01:06:03
of people living in four different types

01:06:06
of neighborhoods and in each of these

01:06:09
neighborhoods the conclusion is that

01:06:11
most people get to know people through

01:06:14
work

01:06:16
yeah and spent time with colleagues also

01:06:23
um after after working hours

01:06:26
and many people also get to know people

01:06:29
through kinship

01:06:31
from a childhood through the schools of

01:06:34
their children

01:06:36
and they are actually quite a small

01:06:39
amount of social networks in each of

01:06:44
these neighborhoods less than that

01:06:45
percent

01:06:47
[Music]

01:06:47
um

01:06:48
what um when you look at the social

01:06:51
connections of these people there is a

01:06:52
quite a small amount that helps in these

01:06:55
neighborhoods and no matter in which of

01:06:57
the four types of neighborhoods they

01:06:59
look

01:07:00
people seem to develop mostly

01:07:03
bones

01:07:05
connections networks with people from

01:07:09
outside the snake

01:07:11
and so this idea that by bringing the

01:07:14
middle class for example to the middle

01:07:16
class to a cool neighborhood that this

01:07:19
would be a way to create these social

01:07:21
networks and when you look at this then

01:07:24
these social networks also develop

01:07:27
outside the neighborhood so why to focus

01:07:29
so much on that neighborhood where

01:07:31
people live

01:07:33
very culturally kind of like

01:07:37
culture e

01:07:40
ffort

01:07:44
in other countries you mean yeah the

01:07:46
situation would be different

01:07:52
donations

01:07:54
well I told you it's important to

01:07:56
understand the context of this of this

01:07:58
study

01:07:59
but in any case also for for Western

01:08:01
European cities if you if you would

01:08:03
study this process over time I think you

01:08:06
would find out that connections are less

01:08:10
neighborhood based than they used to I

01:08:12
can imagine that this neighborhood will

01:08:14
still be important

01:08:16
and people still get to know a lot of

01:08:20
um

01:08:21
other families for example through their

01:08:24
children through the school in many

01:08:26
countries of the world we have a school

01:08:28
pitching system where living in a

01:08:30
neighborhood me sending your kids to the

01:08:32
same school and so for sure there are

01:08:34
many reasons why this would be different

01:08:36
in other countries but overall I think

01:08:41
this argument

01:08:42
truth that there are also many social

01:08:44
networks that the total outsides the

01:08:47
neighborhood of course there are also

01:08:49
studies that focus on burning produce

01:08:51
and say well these people are less

01:08:52
mobile than rich people and so it's

01:08:54
exactly for these poor people that this

01:08:56
neighborhood is an important

01:08:58
uh

01:09:00
ground of network population

01:09:04
much more than it is for rich people

01:09:07
and if you do not have a job if you do

01:09:09
not have the money to buy a bus ticket

01:09:11
now that's neighborhood context will be

01:09:13
an important one for social networks to

01:09:16
be develop that's also for different

01:09:19
categories of people this might be

01:09:20
different

01:09:22
but still I think it's important to see

01:09:25
that networks do not only develop inside

01:09:27
a neighborhood that there are also

01:09:29
networks in other parts of other parts

01:09:33
of the city

01:09:34
or with people living in other parts of

01:09:37
this

01:09:40
um

01:09:41
drawing

01:09:42
white double income families

01:09:47
to a neighborhood such as model make and

01:09:52
if it's possible will that then make

01:09:54
these networks diverse a study by Sabina

01:09:58
Rick and Mike

01:10:01
in a German cities I think it was Marx

01:10:05
law in the old area

01:10:08
and they have been interviewing uh the

01:10:11
white

01:10:12
uh middle class people in this example

01:10:15
two women

01:10:17
about their social meds and there is

01:10:19
quite a lot on this diagram I might need

01:10:21
to explain it so you see the women in

01:10:24
the middle and then you have different

01:10:26
scales

01:10:28
you know the neighborhoods you have the

01:10:30
city you have Germany and you have

01:10:33
outside of Germany and so people

01:10:36
who are the important people in your

01:10:39
life ask that and we put them on this

01:10:43
diagram saying well there are people

01:10:45
inside the neighborhoods people living

01:10:47
in the same city but you also know

01:10:49
people in the same country and people

01:10:51
also living roles and for different

01:10:53
people you would get to different

01:10:55
diagrams and what they also did is to

01:10:59
map a contact frequency

01:11:01
so if you have frequent contacts this

01:11:04
error will be more bold than it is for

01:11:07
people so you can have a rare complex

01:11:10
and then they also met the level of

01:11:14
Education an indicator for a class

01:11:20
room saying well are these people that

01:11:22
you frequent are they people of with the

01:11:27
same educational background

01:11:29
middle class people high education

01:11:32
Highly Educated or are these people who

01:11:35
do not have Universal qualifications

01:11:38
now the other thing that you see here is

01:11:41
the type of relation between frequent

01:11:43
these people or do they provide you with

01:11:45
emotional support or instrumentals

01:11:48
materials or a good talk for example on

01:11:52
the issues so it's quite a complex not

01:11:55
but what you see is that first of all

01:11:58
just like in the Chinese example many

01:12:02
people have social networks that are

01:12:05
part of a social network with people

01:12:07
living outside the neighborhoods and

01:12:09
what you also see there is that most of

01:12:12
the connections that these middle class

01:12:14
women in these underprivileged

01:12:16
neighborhoods develop are with other

01:12:19
people with the same educational

01:12:22
qualification so the idea that's

01:12:25
bringing middle class people to another

01:12:27
privileged neighborhood will create

01:12:30
heterogeneous social networks in which

01:12:33
you find poor and rich people people

01:12:34
does not seem to hold true here because

01:12:37
the middle class people that you attract

01:12:39
to these neighborhoods create mostly

01:12:42
social bonds with people like them with

01:12:44
other middle thoughts

01:12:47
the episode is bridging capital

01:12:50
that was the reason why you wanted to

01:12:52
make this neighborhood there's not

01:12:54
really developed

01:12:58
another argument is that

01:13:01
creating a mixed neighborhood

01:13:03
might disrupt the strong ties that exist

01:13:07
there already the only Capital that

01:13:10
exists and the strong forms of social

01:13:13
economic emotional support that people

01:13:17
of the same ethnicity for example

01:13:19
provide when they live in a neighborhood

01:13:22
part of the city

01:13:25
so residents living in this interested

01:13:28
parts of cities Slater argued fall back

01:13:32
on what they know and what they have

01:13:34
each other is bonding capital is crucial

01:13:38
in the lives of poor people in the lives

01:13:42
of newcomers who have just arrived to

01:13:44
the city they will look for core ethics

01:13:46
first

01:13:47
and if you create a mix if you want to

01:13:50
create a mixed neighborhood in these

01:13:52
parts of cloud for example by attracting

01:13:54
another class they will displace some

01:13:57
people and that will disrupt this

01:13:59
bonding Capital Network system

01:14:01
yeah so

01:14:03
what I'm trying to do

01:14:06
is to say well there is an argument

01:14:09
there why you would create a mixed

01:14:11
neighborhood but you also have

01:14:14
a couple of counter arguments as to why

01:14:18
argument might not work or the whole

01:14:21
reason underlying that argument might

01:14:23
not work

01:14:24
social networks

01:14:26
yeah Social Capital owning and bridging

01:14:29
capital

01:14:30
I guess you you got the point there

01:14:34
a second argument is called underclass

01:14:37
Art

01:14:40
and this is an argument that has

01:14:41
developed in the United States in the

01:14:44
1980s

01:14:46
and at that time there was a big

01:14:48
discussion

01:14:49
between structuralists

01:14:52
who look at the causes of poverty in the

01:14:55
declining economic base

01:14:57
and for example Marxist geographers

01:15:00
saying well there is a shift from a

01:15:02
fullness to a post for this capitalism

01:15:05
and this makes it harder for these

01:15:08
people to quiet job

01:15:10
or the arguments that you've heard in

01:15:12
the classes by that Apostles about

01:15:13
polarization

01:15:15
is there a declining job markets

01:15:19
so you're looking for structural causes

01:15:21
of poverty and on the other hand you had

01:15:24
cultures except poverty is dead because

01:15:27
you have a culture of poverty

01:15:31
poor people have certain attitudes have

01:15:34
a certain behavior and this keeps them

01:15:37
in poverty so that was an important

01:15:40
discussion between these two

01:15:42
and this underclass argument

01:15:45
is part of this cultural history of

01:15:47
looking at poverty yeah who is this

01:15:51
underclass

01:15:53
they're not talking about all poor

01:15:56
people in the case of the United States

01:15:58
in the 1980s 33 million people were

01:16:01
consistent who was this underclass that

01:16:04
was a minority in this minority five

01:16:08
million people yeah people who followed

01:16:11
below the

01:16:12
income threshold for which they are

01:16:14
considered to be poor disproportionately

01:16:18
Black and Hispanic minority in this poor

01:16:22
minority but what defines them it's not

01:16:24
so much the poverty or their base but

01:16:27
their behavior

01:16:28
okay there's probably lawlessness drug

01:16:32
use out of Redwood Birds lack of

01:16:35
employment welfare dependency and school

01:16:38
faith

01:16:39
and also these culturalists blame the

01:16:42
poor

01:16:43
to be poor because of their own behavior

01:16:45
and

01:16:46
the way they look different

01:16:49
and so this is this underclass argument

01:16:52
so what is the argument exactly that in

01:16:55
ketos or in neighborhoods where you find

01:16:58
the concentration of poor people that

01:17:02
you find more unemployment more welfare

01:17:04
dependency more early School Leaving

01:17:07
more truancy or criminality more

01:17:10
gambling more direct abuse more alcohol

01:17:13
abuse more out of Bedford Sports teenage

01:17:17
pregnancy more dysfunctional values

01:17:20
whatever that may aim due to

01:17:23
okay

01:17:24
socialization affects within these

01:17:27
things

01:17:28
if you grow up in a neighborhood like

01:17:30
that

01:17:31
and your peers

01:17:34
the people of your age the people that

01:17:36
you frequent

01:17:39
will have a higher chance to be

01:17:43
criminals or gamblers or drug users or

01:17:46
alcohol abusers Etc

01:17:48
and that is why in such neighborhood you

01:17:51
find more of this

01:17:54
we also find a lack of role models with

01:17:57
a job without a drug addiction without

01:18:00
an alcohol

01:18:01
IC and who were not teenage mothers Etc

01:18:05
so there's a lack of

01:18:07
positive role models

01:18:09
and you also have this peer group effect

01:18:11
and so why are you worse of living as a

01:18:16
poor person in a poor neighborhood the

01:18:19
argument of this culture this was that

01:18:21
is because you have these Norms you have

01:18:25
a lack of these role models and you have

01:18:27
these peer group effects which made it

01:18:30
well that's why it's your worst of

01:18:32
living

01:18:34
they also refer to physical

01:18:36
infrastructure institutional networks

01:18:38
the argument was

01:18:40
that but this has been quite an

01:18:42
important argument many policy makers

01:18:45
have been facing

01:18:47
or helping arguing for socialists

01:18:50
because of this

01:18:53
because they were convinced that living

01:18:56
in a poor neighborhood increased the

01:19:00
chances that you found a job less

01:19:03
important than you leave school early

01:19:06
and because of of your friends doing the

01:19:09
saying that you don't go to school

01:19:11
because your friends would do so as well

01:19:13
that you would turn into a criminal

01:19:15
because this is the example that you

01:19:17
have seen mostly

01:19:22
okay now even when there would be a link

01:19:26
between what is on the left and these

01:19:28
poor neighborhoods then it can still be

01:19:30
wonders whether what is the causal

01:19:33
relationship

01:19:34
between these two

01:19:36
here on the map you have Chicago again a

01:19:38
city that we are getting quite familiar

01:19:41
with you see the poverty level

01:19:44
in these neighborhoods that the darker

01:19:46
the red the poorer the neighborhoods are

01:19:49
and you see

01:19:51
people arrested

01:19:56
for a drug use or

01:20:00
something like this the possession of of

01:20:03
Turks

01:20:05
and what you see there is that uh

01:20:08
there is a correlation

01:20:11
between

01:20:13
poverty and the concentration of poverty

01:20:16
this neighborhood and the use of quality

01:20:19
correct and coping is much scattered

01:20:22
much more scattered and but you also see

01:20:25
that in the other neighborhoods where

01:20:29
you have a concentration of poverty that

01:20:32
is much less the case

01:20:35
now I can also wonder to what extent

01:20:38
this graph

01:20:40
is the result of real drug use or the

01:20:46
policing of these Neighbors

01:20:48
if you have a police force that is much

01:20:50
more

01:20:51
on the outlook for drug use in certain

01:20:54
neighborhoods well that it's logical

01:20:55
that this will show up in English

01:20:58
statistics

01:20:59
so there are many reasons why one could

01:21:02
raise concerns about the causal

01:21:04
relationship in this case between drug

01:21:07
use on the one hand and the

01:21:09
concentration of poverty on public so it

01:21:11
could start to criticize like how these

01:21:14
statistics came about one can also see

01:21:16
that for certain drugs there seems to be

01:21:19
a correlation for other circles one can

01:21:22
also see that you have concentrated

01:21:24
poverty that corresponds with a lot of

01:21:28
arrests for drug use but that you also

01:21:30
have neighborhoods with concentration

01:21:31
concentrated poverty organ specialists

01:21:34
so there are many reasons why we would

01:21:37
start to question whether there is a

01:21:39
real cause of relation relationship

01:21:42
concentration of poverty on the one hand

01:21:44
and all these other indicators here on

01:21:47
the slide on the other hand

01:21:51
and another another argument against

01:21:54
this underclass argument would be well

01:21:57
again socialization

01:22:00
be disappears to not only live in these

01:22:04
neighborhoods

01:22:05
these Role Models do not only live in

01:22:08
the neighborhood and Barack Obama could

01:22:10
also be around

01:22:12
yeah engine can can get these Role

01:22:14
Models through TV or the the music that

01:22:17
you're missing so why this focus on the

01:22:21
neighborhood again

01:22:23
third argument for social cohesion

01:22:26
arguments

01:22:28
and here you see

01:22:30
um the basic line of thought

01:22:33
of this of this argument where the

01:22:37
ethnic minorities live isolated from

01:22:40
native touch they have less contact with

01:22:43
Native touch consequently they do not

01:22:45
acquire an adequate command of the Dutch

01:22:49
language are not likely to adopt such

01:22:51
Norms values and will not succeed in

01:22:55
socioeconomic terms

01:22:57
so here you see a mixing of arguments

01:23:00
about ethnic segregation

01:23:03
and socio-economic Mobility

01:23:06
saying that well if you live

01:23:08
in a neighborhood with a high

01:23:10
concentration of people of foreign

01:23:13
background

01:23:14
who speak their mother tongue and who

01:23:16
are less good in speaking Dutch

01:23:20
and if you have less contact with

01:23:24
native Dutch people then you will not

01:23:26
acquire an adequate comment language you

01:23:30
are not likely to evoke Dutch morals and

01:23:33
values and therefore

01:23:36
succeeds another argument that has been

01:23:40
quite an important

01:23:43
in the kind of rhetorics and the kind of

01:23:46
discourse of policy makers advocating a

01:23:49
social mix

01:23:50
saying for example it's not good that in

01:23:53
modern Bank you have a high

01:23:54
concentration of foreign

01:23:58
why is that not good well these people

01:24:01
will not get to speak Dutch and they

01:24:04
will not integrate to use that word they

01:24:08
will not adults touch notes and values

01:24:11
and that will make it harder for them to

01:24:14
climb to social media

01:24:17
again one can Wonder yeah is it only in

01:24:21
the neighborhood that people could get a

01:24:24
chance to develop this kind of

01:24:26
relationships with Native touch even

01:24:29
arguments true you could look at what is

01:24:33
researchers do I will not go into the

01:24:35
into all the details that they say about

01:24:37
as own that's a place where people

01:24:40
develop social networks you've got

01:24:43
leisure activities through which people

01:24:44
can develop

01:24:46
you've got work and you've got the

01:24:49
transport between these three different

01:24:51
so it's important to look at all these

01:24:54
domains and to see what happens between

01:24:56
people

01:24:57
and then you might see that this

01:24:59
neighborhood in which these people live

01:25:01
is less important

01:25:03
another counter argument with focus on

01:25:06
the importance of local culture it's

01:25:08
only because you have a concentration of

01:25:11
people of a certain ethnic background

01:25:13
for example that you can support

01:25:17
the shop that sells

01:25:19
ethnic products that sell the food that

01:25:22
sells the food from the home group where

01:25:24
it allows you to have a church or an

01:25:27
association by focusing on a particular

01:25:30
ethnic group and these kind of places

01:25:33
might be very important they will act as

01:25:36
a protective space they will act as a

01:25:38
safe space in which these people feel

01:25:40
like they've gone and this feeling of

01:25:43
belonging might be very important for

01:25:45
them to and to find a life in this new

01:25:50
country where they are living

01:25:53
the social cohesion argument

01:25:57
a fourth argument will focus on local

01:26:00
services

01:26:02
yeah and it will say that for example in

01:26:06
in

01:26:09
neighborhoods with the concentration of

01:26:12
poverty that you will have less public

01:26:15
and private Services there will be less

01:26:17
shops there will be less Banks and you

01:26:21
might also have less Public Service

01:26:23
these are examples from lootball social

01:26:27
housing estate that I've been talking

01:26:29
about today already and the closure of a

01:26:33
bank and there is no ATM anymore in our

01:26:36
paper

01:26:37
the argument could go well if there

01:26:39
would be more middle class people then

01:26:41
there would be higher interest from

01:26:44
Banks to have an ATM

01:26:48
or other other ships

01:26:53
Chicago

01:26:56
food deserts I don't know whether you've

01:26:58
ever heard about this term but if you

01:27:01
look at healthy foods

01:27:04
grocery shops where can you find them if

01:27:08
you see a map with these different

01:27:12
racial groups I remember it is this

01:27:16
self-identification in the case of

01:27:18
America that is a survey for which

01:27:20
racial group to itself identifiably

01:27:22
identified you see neighborhoods

01:27:24
predominantly white black Hispanic Asian

01:27:27
diverse and you see that in many of

01:27:31
these black neighborhoods which are also

01:27:33
the tourist neighborhoods you find that

01:27:36
it's very hard to find healthy food it's

01:27:39
very hard to find fresh vegetables like

01:27:40
fruit because the shops are so far

01:27:43
yeah so the argument would be that it's

01:27:46
better to create mixed neighborhoods

01:27:48
because that will attract a diverse set

01:27:50
of

01:27:52
um shops and services to these

01:27:55
neighborhoods

01:27:57
we've already been talking about this

01:27:59
that the question of course is what kind

01:28:02
of shops and what kind of services do

01:28:04
you get in the case of this Mentor

01:28:06
eyelasher District one person said well

01:28:09
but this people will not feel

01:28:10
comfortable shops and they will also not

01:28:13
find the products they would like to

01:28:15
find

01:28:16
that's also in gentrifying neighborhoods

01:28:20
and what kind of

01:28:22
shops do you find there

01:28:24
is a shops catering for

01:28:27
people who look for the cheapest food

01:28:29
possible because they have only five

01:28:32
euro to spend in in the last three days

01:28:36
of the month

01:28:37
or is it cafes or restaurants who try to

01:28:42
cater for these

01:28:44
incoming Gentry Fighters

01:28:46
so it's important to look at the

01:28:49
different shaded demands that will

01:28:51
result from creating a mixed and so the

01:28:55
question is if you've mixed name routes

01:28:56
will these shops and services cater for

01:29:00
these poor people

01:29:02
because if that's not the case then it

01:29:04
will displace the shops that existed

01:29:07
there already ended catered For This

01:29:10
audience

01:29:11
in answer we've also been talking about

01:29:13
a lot of these

01:29:15
specialized services that you might get

01:29:18
in neighborhoods

01:29:19
and at least

01:29:21
money transfer short steps or Food Shops

01:29:26
like some African vegetables or

01:29:30
Thai ingredients

01:29:33
and the question is if you try to mix

01:29:35
these neighborhoods to these kind of

01:29:37
shops and these kind of services still

01:29:39
be able to to be to remain or will they

01:29:44
also be displaced because this place

01:29:46
will be involved by a fancy coffee shop

01:29:50
that is mainly catered for these Gentry

01:29:54
farmers so questions around shops

01:29:57
Services catering for different

01:29:59
audiences

01:30:03
argument that you find in the literature

01:30:06
is a political one

01:30:08
starting from the observation that many

01:30:11
neighborhood associations for example

01:30:13
are well mainly run by middle class

01:30:19
and that middle class people are are

01:30:21
much more focal in expressing their

01:30:24
concerns about the people

01:30:26
and so one could say that well by

01:30:28
attracting the middle class to a poor

01:30:31
neighborhood this neighborhood will be

01:30:33
higher on the political agenda

01:30:37
um and I I have this quote there from

01:30:40
that I read at the end of the Excursion

01:30:42
inshallah in my channel for people

01:30:45
stating well there are also taxpayers

01:30:47
why don't you listen to us

01:30:50
yeah so the idea is that by mixing

01:30:53
neighborhoods you will put these

01:30:56
neighborhoods higher Jim

01:30:59
I'm in Belgium people from outside the

01:31:02
EU without a built-in passport we are

01:31:05
able to vote

01:31:07
but this will not be the case in every

01:31:09
country and so you can have a

01:31:11
neighborhood with a lot of people from

01:31:13
outside the room who do not have a say

01:31:16
in vocal politics and why would this

01:31:19
local mayor address the concerns of

01:31:23
people living

01:31:24
any of these people are not able to

01:31:27
Express their needs and to put a stamp

01:31:31
on the political agenda then why would

01:31:33
you do so the argument is well middle

01:31:35
class people are

01:31:37
able they have these connections with

01:31:40
politicians or at least they will be

01:31:42
listened to

01:31:45
um

01:31:48
well in I'm not going to go into into

01:31:51
that into that example

01:31:54
um but it dealt with the Emperor of

01:31:56
Highway

01:31:57
and that issue of air pollution to the

01:32:00
observation that most of the

01:32:01
neighborhoods lying next to that Highway

01:32:04
are rather so one good question what

01:32:07
would happen with this whole issue of

01:32:09
the whole debate around the highway if

01:32:12
these neighborhoods could not be your

01:32:15
neighborhoods bogus income but rather

01:32:17
than they were the highest activities

01:32:23
so the political arguments

01:32:25
by mixing neighborhoods we will put them

01:32:28
higher on the political agent

01:32:30
of course the issue isn't my report

01:32:32
she's not listened to poor people

01:32:38
political agenda without these middle

01:32:41
class residents

01:32:44
the sixth argument is a bit different

01:32:46
the spatial mismatch does not focus so

01:32:49
much on the issue of segregation but if

01:32:53
you follow these five dimensions of

01:32:57
um

01:32:57
Messi and London it focuses on

01:33:00
concentration clustering where do poor

01:33:03
people live in which part of the city

01:33:05
are these neighborhoods with the

01:33:07
concentration of poverty and this is a

01:33:11
diagram from Cape Town quite an old one

01:33:13
but it's still very much the game the

01:33:16
case where do you have job opportunities

01:33:19
in light and where do you have

01:33:22
population where do people live and

01:33:25
where do they where where could they

01:33:28
and most of the job opportunities are

01:33:31
still in the previously white

01:33:32
neighborhoods particularly in essential

01:33:35
business district of Cape Town but most

01:33:38
of the poor people in Cape Town are

01:33:41
living quite far away from these places

01:33:44
so there is a mismatch between the

01:33:46
places where it's good lift and the

01:33:49
places where the good potential work and

01:33:51
so it's not just important to focus on

01:33:53
segregation and the fact that poverty is

01:33:56
concentrated

01:33:58
in these more peripheral neighborhoods

01:34:00
in the case

01:34:01
but you need to focus then also on the

01:34:04
distance between various neighborhoods

01:34:06
are and the places where these people

01:34:08
could work so there's this the spatial

01:34:10
mismatch argument focusing on the

01:34:13
mismatch between place of residence and

01:34:16
potential places of the world

01:34:21
Western European cities tend to have a

01:34:24
better public transport than North

01:34:27
American for southern

01:34:29
so one could argue this argument will

01:34:32
hold less true in the case of Brussels

01:34:34
for example because even if you live in

01:34:37
Philadelphia there are good training

01:34:40
connections to Apple short places

01:34:44
um this is a map

01:34:46
for Brussels

01:34:49
job density you see two clusters the

01:34:52
inner city

01:34:53
and all these offices and the area

01:34:56
around the airport

01:35:00
um where the poor people in Brussels

01:35:01
live mostly in this 19th century belt

01:35:05
around beginners meaning that there's

01:35:09
not so much of a spatial mismatch if you

01:35:11
live in Mozambique you can walk to many

01:35:14
job opportunities of course the question

01:35:16
like this where do you have both skilled

01:35:19
job properties

01:35:21
so if you don't need a lot of Education

01:35:24
when you see that more or less the same

01:35:25
clusters

01:35:27
their scores as Jobs shift

01:35:30
towards the airport the issue is what

01:35:34
are the transport connections between

01:35:36
Golden Bank St

01:35:39
Josephs and these areas where you find

01:35:44
the growth of most new or most new jobs

01:35:48
and in the case of Brussels the issue

01:35:50
will also be

01:35:51
what are the language requirements for

01:35:53
these jobs because these are jobs

01:35:55
flounders what kind of touch proficiency

01:36:00
do you need and often for these jobs

01:36:03
that will be touched and French maybe

01:36:05
also English so just language wise these

01:36:09
jobs are already quite difficult

01:36:14
so the spatial mismatch argument

01:36:16
focusing on the location of these poor

01:36:19
neighborhoods so it's not just

01:36:21
how mixed these neighborhoods are

01:36:23
whether poor and richness side by side

01:36:25
but where do these concentrations of

01:36:27
poverty occur

01:36:30
last argument stigmatism

01:36:33
and this is an argument that Slater has

01:36:36
been writing about it is important to

01:36:38
look what happens outside of these

01:36:41
neighborhoods understood

01:36:43
you know why is it harder to climb the

01:36:46
social leather to embroider out for all

01:36:49
of the equivalents because teachers who

01:36:51
live outside this neighborhood come with

01:36:54
a set of stereotypes about pupils in

01:36:57
these schools and that will not give

01:37:00
them the same

01:37:01
educational chances as people going to a

01:37:04
school in other games

01:37:06
or if your postcode is I don't know what

01:37:09
is the postcode if you apply for a job

01:37:12
and you okay

01:37:16
if you apply for a joke and this is your

01:37:19
address is there

01:37:20
debt and potential employers might

01:37:22
already come the set of stereotypes why

01:37:25
not too high

01:37:26
so why would it be good then to create a

01:37:31
social mix well one could create or what

01:37:34
could argue for a social mix because

01:37:36
that will reduce the stigma located or

01:37:40
the stigma attached to these things

01:37:44
and of course there might also be other

01:37:47
ways to work on that stigma you don't

01:37:49
need a mix to do that you also can make

01:37:52
people living outside this neighborhood

01:37:53
which you can make them aware of

01:37:55
and what has really happened inside

01:38:00
and so but this stigmatization my

01:38:03
potential employers or teachers or

01:38:06
policemen who work in these

01:38:08
neighborhoods but who do not live there

01:38:10
could be another argument as to why a

01:38:14
social mix is necessary

01:38:17
yes

01:38:19
so are people living in impoverished is

01:38:22
it well does it make does it matter

01:38:23
whether you are poor enough

01:38:26
mostly poor neighborhood surrounded by

01:38:29
people like you or whether you live as a

01:38:32
poor person in a mixed neighborhood does

01:38:34
that matter there are seven arguments

01:38:37
that I have given now as to why that

01:38:40
could matter

01:38:42
okay for each of these seven I've also

01:38:45
given a couple of counter arguments

01:38:48
as to why creating a mix could actually

01:38:52
be a bad thing to distract the ties that

01:38:56
exist already yeah or is not necessary

01:38:59
because people find peers and Role

01:39:02
Models outside the neighborhood

01:39:04
or people will middle class people

01:39:08
arrive in these neighborhoods will not

01:39:10
create uh social networks with the

01:39:14
people

01:39:16
Etc so for each of these arguments I've

01:39:19
given a couple of counter arguments

01:39:24
what about the privileged

01:39:26
I will skip that

01:39:29
in Tom Slater's paper you will find many

01:39:31
arguments for that

01:39:34
um I will get to a small conclusion

01:39:39
okay so when we discuss this ideal

01:39:42
social mix and we discuss the question

01:39:45
is social mix feasible is social Mis

01:39:48
desirable then what is my take on it I

01:39:52
think Avis romaville

01:39:54
who has been doing a lot of work on

01:39:56
housing here in Brussels has summarized

01:40:00
this quite well

01:40:01
the concept of social mixed you rights

01:40:04
which now legitimizes a good part of the

01:40:09
regional interventions in the area of

01:40:12
housing here in Brussels she's talking

01:40:14
about the Brussels capital region and

01:40:17
how the ideal of social mix for the

01:40:20
concept of social mix has legitimized a

01:40:23
good part of this intervention

01:40:25
is according to her not very convinced

01:40:28
convinced

01:40:29
the gentrification which is underway in

01:40:34
the central neighborhoods

01:40:35
in those neighborhoods where

01:40:38
these authorities are doing making a big

01:40:41
effort to attract military

01:40:44
indicates that when there is a mix

01:40:47
it is only a Prelude to the eviction of

01:40:51
the most disadvantaged via the

01:40:54
mechanisms of a completely deregulated

01:40:57
real estate markets we live in a city

01:41:01
but only ten percent of the total

01:41:05
residential units our social housing

01:41:09
yeah there is almost no control over the

01:41:12
remaining 90 percent

01:41:15
and so if you try to attract

01:41:17
middle class residents

01:41:20
to this 19th century

01:41:23
an industrial neighborhoods around

01:41:25
Brussels if you do that then it will

01:41:28
push out over the elsewhere you've seen

01:41:30
it in the snap of I clicking where do

01:41:32
these poor people moving out of a

01:41:35
gentrifying neighborhood so that they

01:41:36
move to build world

01:41:39
to ask to dedicate to however

01:41:44
you move poverty elsewhere

01:41:48
so when there is a mix it can exist for

01:41:51
a while but then it's only a produced to

01:41:54
the eviction of the most disadvantages

01:41:55
because rents will go up eventually

01:41:59
and these poor people that live there

01:42:01
are not able to afford these rents I

01:42:03
will need to move elsewhere to find a

01:42:06
place

01:42:07
so this social makes feasible

01:42:10
in the case of Brussels with very little

01:42:12
uh controlled of authorities on the

01:42:16
housing markets no this is not feasible

01:42:19
she said

01:42:20
is it desirable a second question that I

01:42:23
asked even if this eviction could be

01:42:26
avoided even if you think of a situation

01:42:30
25 social housing every 50 percent and

01:42:35
you will not evict this poor people from

01:42:38
these neighborhoods then she argues

01:42:40
there is nothing to indicate that these

01:42:43
disadvantaged populations would

01:42:46
eventually benefit in any way from this

01:42:49
mix

01:42:51
and why because the attraction of this

01:42:54
building of families would change the

01:42:57
shops will not lead to this

01:43:01
heterogeneous networks that these policy

01:43:04
makers dream

01:43:07
that will not lead to the kind of social

01:43:10
cohesion that underlies this

01:43:14
social cognition

01:43:17
does not

01:43:19
um make the kind of role models

01:43:22
with people who believed in this

01:43:24
underclass argument

01:43:26
and we're hoping for Etc

01:43:29
and so she's arguing in the case of

01:43:31
Brussels again it's important to

01:43:34
provincialize these studies and to

01:43:36
understand the complexity of the

01:43:38
Brussels case only 10 social housing

01:43:41
poverty at this moment concentrated in

01:43:45
neighborhoods with quite a good voltage

01:43:47
very close to these jobs and so there

01:43:50
are many particularities that we need to

01:43:53
understand but what she is arguing is

01:43:55
that the kind of social mix that this

01:43:58
Brussels Capital feature tries to tries

01:44:00
to create leads to the displacement of

01:44:02
people to neighborhoods to parts of the

01:44:06
city which are much much less connected

01:44:08
through job opportunities

01:44:10
where you find much less shops and

01:44:13
services

01:44:15
Etc so too much

01:44:17
worst locations actually and even if

01:44:21
this kind of mix could be realized she

01:44:23
argues then this is not desirable and

01:44:27
disadvantaged population will not

01:44:29
benefit from this this will not help

01:44:31
them to climb the social benefit and she

01:44:34
will draw on all the seven counter

01:44:37
arguments that I've given uh to uh

01:44:42
substantiate this claim

01:44:47
so

01:44:49
well I think when you

01:44:51
I remember that I once asked an exam

01:44:55
question such as put yourself the shoes

01:44:57
of the man of Antwerp you are now the

01:45:00
mayor of network but you

01:45:03
um

01:45:04
promulgate social mixed policies or not

01:45:06
the question was a bit more complicated

01:45:08
but summary I think it's important that

01:45:12
when you have such a question when you

01:45:13
ever work for a city or when you need to

01:45:17
discuss this from an academic point of

01:45:19
view I think there are a couple of

01:45:21
questions that you need to ask

01:45:23
yeah the first one is whom are we

01:45:27
talking about

01:45:29
why do we treat why do we want to create

01:45:32
a social mix

01:45:34
is it because we say well this is the

01:45:36
interest under privilege or I've skipped

01:45:40
now most of this

01:45:41
a part of the class could it also be in

01:45:43
interest of the privilege I remember we

01:45:46
were in Prescott one of the Richard

01:45:49
richer richest municipalities of Belgium

01:45:53
and some of you said well it'd be good

01:45:55
to have some uh more diverse details

01:45:59
because people might for example change

01:46:02
the way they think about poor people if

01:46:04
they have some of them living books by

01:46:07
you see that all of the arguments

01:46:10
so far have been dealing with the under

01:46:13
privilege so for that reason I think

01:46:15
it's important to ask

01:46:17
what about the crystals

01:46:20
and in the discussion

01:46:22
seminars that we have next week there

01:46:24
will be one paper that I've written

01:46:27
together

01:46:29
that deals with it so we have a chance

01:46:32
to come back to this true I think I'll

01:46:34
discussions

01:46:36
do we only focus on

01:46:40
socioeconomic segregation are also are

01:46:42
we also interested in this ethnic

01:46:44
arguments have you seen for example in

01:46:47
the social cohesion argument the two

01:46:50
were conflated and so do we want to

01:46:52
create a social mix in the interest of

01:46:56
ethnic minorities or does the ethnic

01:46:59
majority

01:47:00
if that still exists because more and

01:47:02
more cities in Belgium do not have an

01:47:05
ethnic majority

01:47:07
but we also

01:47:10
think about this group and we want to

01:47:12
promulgate search boxes

01:47:15
are we interested in the second

01:47:18
residence who are there already or are

01:47:22
we mainly thinking about newcomers or

01:47:25
arrivals

01:47:26
and so I think this question for whom do

01:47:29
we want to create a social effects in

01:47:31
whose interests is the first one that

01:47:35
you should ask

01:47:36
a second one is the issue of scale

01:47:41
I told you last week already scheduled

01:47:44
is the Crux of the matter if you want to

01:47:46
calculate segregation in dishes it

01:47:49
matters at which scale you do so in

01:47:52
Belgium we have this very small

01:47:53
statistical units and for that reason we

01:47:56
find that there's

01:47:58
high levels of segregation but if you

01:48:01
would make the statistical units bigger

01:48:04
then there would be less signage

01:48:07
your comments about the Reds Square

01:48:10
relates to this we can create a social

01:48:13
mix in this very small neighborhood and

01:48:16
if you would look at the bigger picture

01:48:19
if you would look at this I mentioned

01:48:21
area as a whole then you would find out

01:48:24
that there is no social business mostly

01:48:27
wealthy people who have settled there

01:48:29
and so I think scale

01:48:31
is a very important issue as well as the

01:48:34
question where do we want to create

01:48:37
assumptions

01:48:38
I think that most of

01:48:40
the social mix literature is concerned

01:48:44
with this disadvantaged neighborhoods

01:48:46
the focus is on these neighborhoods and

01:48:49
the need to create Associates

01:48:52
if you would look at more than make you

01:48:54
would look at socio-economic position of

01:48:56
people and if you would look at the

01:48:58
ethnic maker of this neighborhood you

01:49:01
will find out that modern day is maybe

01:49:03
the most socially mixed neighborhoods or

01:49:06
Brussels if not Belgium

01:49:08
and most of the homogeneous

01:49:11
neighborhoods are white Suburban

01:49:14
municipalities so why are we only

01:49:16
concerned with this disadvantaged

01:49:19
neighborhoods Hawaii are we not

01:49:22
concerned with the homogeneity of many

01:49:25
of these Suburban groups

01:49:27
which are better off is there a need to

01:49:30
create a social mix as well or not and

01:49:34
I've inverse cards for those who joined

01:49:36
to enter by talking about the way they

01:49:38
protested against the trend against the

01:49:41
local Asylum Center against any attempt

01:49:44
to uh well to to make this

01:49:47
municipality

01:49:50
I could even argue that most of the

01:49:53
literature and most of the concerns of

01:49:56
policy makers Target only those

01:50:00
disadvantaged neighborhoods which are

01:50:03
centrifiable which have the potential to

01:50:06
attract middle class newcomers because

01:50:09
that's good for the next but then the

01:50:12
question becomes rare is this possible

01:50:15
and then enter we have been on this

01:50:19
triangular Square Bowling plane well if

01:50:22
you look at the houses there there are

01:50:24
many fancy

01:50:26
um houses

01:50:27
which are

01:50:29
potential homes for rich uh families

01:50:35
but if you move more to the north you

01:50:37
only find very small houses which will

01:50:40
never attract this kind of

01:50:42
where do you have debates about social

01:50:45
mix about the need to gentrify

01:50:48
neighborhoods well only in certain

01:50:51
in a limited amount is disadvantages

01:50:56
so I think this rare question is an

01:50:59
important one where are we interested to

01:51:02
create the solutions

01:51:04
you will notice that these discussions

01:51:06
focus on a very limited number of paper

01:51:08
you know the issue is never discussed in

01:51:11
other parts of the city

01:51:15
it's also important to look at the issue

01:51:18
of scaling I already discussed that but

01:51:21
here again many of our Maps only focus

01:51:24
on Antwerp or the Brussels capital

01:51:26
region while I've told you that many of

01:51:29
these quarterback effects

01:51:31
have consequences in other parts of the

01:51:34
urban region or even other parts of the

01:51:36
country if housing prices in Brussels go

01:51:39
out business effects inshallahua this

01:51:43
makes us walking around in Machinery to

01:51:46
see the property there

01:51:48
okay or we go to Chrome search

01:51:51
in French quite far away from Brussels

01:51:54
effect

01:51:55
s or Nino over leading it yeah all these

01:51:58
municipalities are affected by this

01:52:01
gentrification of

01:52:03
us and so it's important that we discuss

01:52:05
this issue at the scale of

01:52:08
at least the urban region

01:52:12
so for whom in whose interest do we want

01:52:15
to create social mix where

01:52:18
so you want to do that which

01:52:20
neighborhoods are we actually talking

01:52:22
about

01:52:23
and then I think it's also important to

01:52:25
focus on this why question

01:52:28
if you want to create a social gifts to

01:52:30
counter poverty

01:52:32
or even to stimulate this cultural

01:52:35
integration and I think that there might

01:52:37
be many policy Alternatives which are

01:52:41
less

01:52:42
costly and which may have much bigger

01:52:46
effects

01:52:48
yeah I'm not going to go too much into

01:52:50
this but you can imagine that you can

01:52:53
try to combat poverty not through the

01:52:57
spatial intervention

01:52:59
but through other accounts social

01:53:03
welfare Etc

01:53:07
is it to improve the local Tech space

01:53:10
we've seen this quote from this elder

01:53:12
man of cats and I think for many Belgian

01:53:15
cities this will be an important one why

01:53:17
do we find gentrification importance

01:53:21
yeah and why do we want to attract the

01:53:24
middle class to the city it is because

01:53:27
that is good for our Municipal budget

01:53:30
yeah but then even then I will always

01:53:33
eat this rhetoric of this is in the

01:53:35
interest of the people that included and

01:53:38
this will eventually help them to find

01:53:40
the social media

01:53:43
create social mix to counter racist or

01:53:46
classes stereotypes what would that mean

01:53:50
I guess that would mean that we would

01:53:53
rethink where and for whom we try to

01:53:57
create a social mix and you see that in

01:54:00
most of the policy discourse this is

01:54:02
quite absent

01:54:05
however if stigmatization is one of the

01:54:09
reasons why living in modern day

01:54:15
makes your life more difficult than

01:54:17
other parts of the city but it is about

01:54:20
stigmatization and discrimination and

01:54:23
what kind of spatial interventions that

01:54:25
would be needed to counter these

01:54:27
stereotypes I think you would create

01:54:29
social media completely and different

01:54:33
way

01:54:34
so this is a bit of an open-ended

01:54:38
um

01:54:39
conclusion with a lot of questions but I

01:54:43
hope that

01:54:44
by giving you Arguments for social mix

01:54:47
and counter arguments guests

01:54:50
and by encouraging you to think about

01:54:53
the context

01:54:55
in which you want to create a social mix

01:54:58
or not that you are able to think

01:55:00
critically about the effects of

01:55:03
segregation and the needs to create a

01:55:07
social mix or launch

01:55:09
yeah

01:55:11
um five plus seven I propose that

01:55:15
um we almost leave it here for now we

01:55:19
still have time to discuss all these

01:55:21
issues next week in the seminar all

01:55:25
these texts will deal again with

01:55:27
patterns of segregation and the effects

01:55:30
of saying so I think it's good that we

01:55:32
have time to discuss this

01:55:35
next week Monday for the geographers

01:55:39
and the people from planning and have

01:55:42
awesome students is this information

01:55:45
correct

01:55:46
next week Monday we have eight

01:55:49
papers eight presentations to discuss

01:55:53
I don't see any

01:55:55
comments so I suppose that this is the

01:55:57
schedule as it is and then next week

01:56:00
Tuesday and Thursday we have two other

01:56:04
seminars for students from moose

01:56:08
and Thursday students from four cities

01:56:13
yeah is that correct

01:56:16
yes all your presentations are there you

01:56:19
find your names

01:56:23
this is the information

01:56:27
10 minutes

01:56:30
and we will I will need to be rather

01:56:33
um strict which is 10 minutes

01:56:36
maximum

01:56:38
especially having AIDS presentations in

01:56:42
the first seminar but also in the other

01:56:45
seminars I prefer to uh keep the time

01:56:51
and to limit these presentations to 10

01:56:55
minutes because otherwise there's not

01:56:56
enough time for discussion these are

01:56:58
discussion seminars not presentations

01:57:01
so limit your presentations to 10

01:57:03
minutes include a slide with title names

01:57:07
email I don't know all of you so it's

01:57:09
important that I'm able to mark the

01:57:12
presentations to connect this with the

01:57:14
right students remember that I need a

01:57:16
core court or arguments a link with the

01:57:19
required readings

01:57:21
remember that we also expect all

01:57:24
students who have read all the papers of

01:57:27
the required readings

01:57:29
so I'm supposed that Slater has been

01:57:31
read by Kevin Olsen and preserve and the

01:57:35
textbook a chapter like what's your name

01:57:38
and then important

01:57:40
in order to not to lose too much time

01:57:44
with technical issues I would like all

01:57:48
of you to send your PowerPoints or ETF

01:57:51
or whatever you're going to use to

01:57:53
support your presentation at least 30

01:57:56
minutes before the seminar to my email

01:57:59
address

01:58:00
whether we transfer link if necessary

01:58:03
and if you want me to check with the

01:58:06
presentation works on my computer

01:58:10
then I suggest you to do that maybe

01:58:13
already the evening before and then ask

01:58:16
me maybe check whether the PowerPoint

01:58:19
approach or do it in a PDF so that's the

01:58:22
different PowerPoint versions things may

01:58:24
change

01:58:27
but please send them before the

01:58:29
presentation so that I have the time

01:58:32
so let me know whose time with swapping

01:58:37
laptops and

01:58:40
laptops that can't make the connection

01:58:42
with the screen Etc

01:58:46
just to make sure that we are all able

01:58:49
to present and that we have time to

01:58:51
receivers and that will also allow us to

01:58:53
discuss everything that has been said

01:58:57
and last decision

01:59:01
okay then I would look forward to see

01:59:03
you next week

01:59:05
[Music]

01:59:29
all right

01:59:49
this is so stupid

01:59:58
not talking about questions

02:00:03
foreign

02:00:35
thank you

02:01:11
thank you

02:01:26
again

02:01:40
yes I

02:01:42
like bye

02:01:53
yes and yes

02:01:58
[Music]

02:02:02
when the first version

02:02:05
yes and then these people have been

02:02:07
added to the list yes

02:02:24
maybe there could be a way

02:02:26
that yeah

02:02:30
if not for next week then for

02:02:34
what would you prefer to do it

02:02:37
but

02:02:46
yeah because now it's hard for me

02:02:56
okay yeah

02:02:58
[Music]

02:03:10
yeah

02:03:14
I've done it next week so it's

02:03:17
foreign

02:03:43
[Music]

02:03:52
sure

02:04:08
so the first thing is can we call like

02:04:12
any project that things to attract

02:04:14
investment or hence the apology of life

02:04:18
in a neighborhood like this uh doing a

02:04:22
taxi and this kind of products can we

02:04:25
call they are social mix projects

02:04:28
because

02:04:32
that's 100

02:04:40
you still have a project

02:04:44
improve

02:04:46
public spaces

02:04:58
so like do they say that they are social

02:05:01
based projects like openly

02:05:04
so in some of these I've shown you some

02:05:07
some parts from policy games

02:05:14
okay

02:05:17
in order to attract another kind of

02:05:20
presence

02:05:21
yes

02:05:32
do you have any other if you have

02:05:34
already used some references that talk

02:05:37
about Brussels

02:05:39
in the presentation I haven't shown that

02:05:42
but

02:05:43
there is quite a rich people Geography

02:05:45
okay so it finally shows papers I will

02:05:48
find something well I think you will

02:05:50
find a lot of women who benefits from

02:05:52
home ownership support policies in

02:05:54
Brussels that's where this this quote

02:05:55
comes from

02:05:58
clicking and moving in out of Brussels

02:06:00
much of his work is on gentrification

02:06:03
but you will also see that some of his

02:06:05
papers deal with

02:06:06
social mix in relation to uh

02:06:09
gentrification specifically so there's a

02:06:12
lot of work

02:06:14
yeah from here

02:06:17
uh and the other thing that I don't know

02:06:19
if I'm mistaken but I have the

02:06:21
impression that there is not actually

02:06:23
evidence that social actually works like

02:06:27
you presented some arguments

02:06:30
but they're not

02:06:32
recorded life is

02:06:34
more like suppositions and

02:06:38
well I think the infamous

02:06:43
trying to find out the

02:06:46
effects and and showing that there are

02:06:48
some cases where

02:06:51
people might benefit from such things

02:06:53
but even any questions

02:06:58
mixed neighborhood so it's quite costly

02:07:01
yes what would happen

02:07:04
the structural problems if you reduce

02:07:07
all this money to

02:07:09
try and comment over

02:07:13
again so even

02:07:14
turns out social response

02:07:21
just yeah so so even even if you could

02:07:26
turn out that by creating social mix you

02:07:29
improve

02:07:31
the situation

02:07:33
any questions that is what would happen

02:07:36
so

02:07:37
it should try and attack it

02:07:40
it's not through spatial

02:07:44
we're trying to okay

02:07:47
yes

02:07:52
thank you

02:07:54
improving schools

02:08:05
we have also time to discuss next next

02:08:07
yes

02:08:16

# 6 Cultures of urban research

00:00:02
thank you

00:00:14
oh my God

00:00:20
um

00:00:28
thank you

00:00:33
services

00:00:36
welcome everyone

00:00:40
good evening this certainly is my

00:00:43
favorite time of the day to teach teach

00:00:45
a course at 5 PM after every start at 8

00:00:48
A.M so anyways uh welcome to Urban

00:00:50
social geography or urban geography

00:00:52
depending on your exact type of

00:00:54
enrollment I am boss van Hur for those

00:00:57
who don't know me yet and I'll be your

00:00:59
let's say your lecturer for today's

00:01:01
session and next week's session

00:01:04
um for some reason because I was I had

00:01:06
started a web stream on panopto but for

00:01:08
some reason I was I'm receiving emails

00:01:10
from Individual students asking for

00:01:13
permission to gain access to the panopto

00:01:15
webstream I gave everyone

00:01:17
access access until a minute ago now

00:01:19
I'll stop so because I have to teach at

00:01:22
some point

00:01:23
um so if you receive let's say messages

00:01:24
from your fellow students who cannot

00:01:26
attend the reason is that they arrived

00:01:27
after five past five and I need to get

00:01:30
started but if all goes well the

00:01:32
recording will be recorded and uploaded

00:01:34
it went wrong in the previous lecture

00:01:36
today because I've been up to technical

00:01:37
difficulties but hopefully we'll manage

00:01:40
to day I might close the window at some

00:01:43
point but it might help to get some

00:01:46
oxygen in here so feel free to also open

00:01:48
windows at the end if you prefer

00:01:52
um welcome so two sessions

00:01:55
um as with some other course we run

00:01:57
especially the big introductory Master

00:01:59
Level courses

00:02:01
um Urban social geography urban

00:02:03
geography is a thematic course so it

00:02:05
tries to give you an insight into

00:02:07
different let's say teams around let's

00:02:09
say concerning let's say different takes

00:02:11
on Urban Geography I would personally

00:02:14
prefer to call this course Urban Theory

00:02:16
yeah because I think we do more than

00:02:18
just geography but the basic idea is to

00:02:20
give different conceptual analytical

00:02:22
perspectives on how to how to study or

00:02:25
how we can study Europe

00:02:27
my role

00:02:28
in this in this course and I guess also

00:02:31
in my own research specialty is I'm the

00:02:34
cultural guy so I I tend to focus on

00:02:36
more cultural issues uh so I'll be

00:02:38
talking you through

00:02:39
both today and next week Monday July say

00:02:42
cultural approaches to studying the

00:02:44
urban

00:02:45
um today's session oops here we are

00:02:47
today's session is really you see a

00:02:49
historical overview

00:02:51
um in the sense that I want to go

00:02:53
through some discussions which you might

00:02:55
know uh or either let's say in generic

00:02:59
terms or relatively specifically around

00:03:02
let's see how let's say uh thinking

00:03:05
about let's say cultural approach

00:03:06
towards the urban has been informed

00:03:08
let's say historically speaking so I'm

00:03:09
going to go through a number of let's

00:03:11
say historical steps mainly focusing on

00:03:13
let's say the impact that sort of the

00:03:15
thinking about the post-modern Assad

00:03:16
this seems like old hats seems like old

00:03:19
information it's it's certainly a debate

00:03:20
that is not used with this kind of

00:03:23
terminology except maybe unless a

00:03:25
journalistic media but certainly not

00:03:26
academically asking speaks in the last

00:03:29
10 years I wouldn't say that people's

00:03:31
modern has been the main Obsession for

00:03:32
for let's say for research but I would

00:03:35
argue that much of what has been

00:03:36
discussed from the 1980s onwards more or

00:03:39
less around the postmodern as already is

00:03:42
still being let's say dealt with

00:03:44
although using a different vocabulary

00:03:46
yeah this is what you will often see is

00:03:48
that the terminology terminologies might

00:03:50
change but if you open adapt in more

00:03:53
historical lands you will see the summit

00:03:54
even though the terminologies have

00:03:56
changed then let's see the underlying on

00:03:58
uh let's say content or the substance

00:04:01
that's behind terminology as we made the

00:04:03
same over many many years so not

00:04:05
everything is new even though you use a

00:04:07
new terminology so today is a more

00:04:09
historical session you can see on

00:04:10
historical historic sized approach

00:04:13
next week it's I mean rather generically

00:04:16
called Urban cultures but there I want

00:04:18
to sort of give you a number of

00:04:19
perspectives let's say on or let's say

00:04:21
what could temporary approaches towards

00:04:22
studying uh the urban from a cultural

00:04:25
perspective

00:04:27
um I will not give a definition of

00:04:29
culture I mean I'm not I mean so it does

00:04:32
that's it's a lost it's a lost task it's

00:04:34
not going to work I'm also not going to

00:04:36
give a definition let's say media

00:04:38
Scholars are not going to give a

00:04:40
definition on what media is still they

00:04:43
do interesting research but please keep

00:04:45
in mind that one of my aims here is also

00:04:47
to if you decide to adopt a cultural

00:04:50
approach please be very clear and

00:04:52
specify and unpacking and

00:04:54
operationalizing your use of terminology

00:04:56
because it can mean so many different

00:04:58
things yeah so you have to be quite

00:04:59
specific and hopefully my lessons will

00:05:02
help with bits to give you let's say an

00:05:04
insight into the different layers or

00:05:06
different let's say let's say lines of

00:05:08
research that exist and that all use the

00:05:10
terminology around around culture so

00:05:12
that's what I'm going to try let's say

00:05:13
to bring across uh today

00:05:17
so this is basically the structure of

00:05:19
today's session let's see how far we get

00:05:21
it's always unpredictable with slides

00:05:24
and then mood of the day and questions

00:05:26
of students Etc

00:05:27
but first I want to start with a very

00:05:30
let's see setting the scene focusing on

00:05:32
the cultural turn the humanities and the

00:05:34
social sciences I assume most of you

00:05:37
will more or less know what the cultural

00:05:39
Authority Humanity social sciences is so

00:05:42
we'll not discuss this in depth yeah

00:05:43
there are many many books written on

00:05:45
this again it's a debate I think that is

00:05:47
more or less

00:05:48
not finished but it has been let's say

00:05:50
many of the debates we've had when

00:05:52
discussing the cultural term Humanity

00:05:54
social sciences have now and we've been

00:05:56
internalized in everyday research so in

00:05:58
that sense it has become well

00:06:00
naturalized in in in very literal sense

00:06:03
so that's the first part very much

00:06:05
setting to see second part I want to

00:06:07
talk to you about post-modernism and the

00:06:10
city there I will mainly focus on the

00:06:13
work of Frederick Jameson not because I

00:06:15
think that he's the only one who has

00:06:16
written on postmodernism in the city

00:06:18
he's not even an urban scholar per se he

00:06:20
actually comes from literary studies and

00:06:22
philosophy but his work is thinking

00:06:24
about this has been very influential

00:06:26
especially because it has been picked up

00:06:28
by Urban Scholars at a later stage

00:06:31
among which the Los Angeles School of

00:06:33
urbanism which is the third section the

00:06:35
third part of today's lecture because

00:06:38
they really have worked you could say

00:06:40
with this with this idea of the

00:06:41
postmodern and the city and have

00:06:43
proposed new ways of studying this city

00:06:45
as we will see not everything that you

00:06:48
have proposed uh was as new as they have

00:06:50
claimed but still that it has been quite

00:06:52
a foundational moment for for the study

00:06:55
of the urban for urban studies at large

00:06:57
to close sorry now not too close then

00:06:59
there's a fourth section which adopts

00:07:02
was it continues partially underwater

00:07:04
School of urbanism did but really sort

00:07:07
of broadens and broadens the debate and

00:07:09
has perhaps been more influential also

00:07:11
and this is literature that's usually

00:07:13
summarized or with terminologies around

00:07:15
Urban Landscapes or the symbolic economy

00:07:18
yeah these are terms that you see

00:07:20
popping up especially from the mid 90s

00:07:22
90s early 2000s onwards and that is

00:07:25
still very influential in in our

00:07:28
thinking on on the city and culture

00:07:30
today

00:07:31
um very last part I will discuss this

00:07:33
today or I'll pick this up tomorrow uh

00:07:36
it's what I call meeting halfway uh

00:07:39
Urban anthropology cultural studies and

00:07:41
the spatial turn my entry point in

00:07:43
discussing the urban that's in and the

00:07:45
cultural culture is trulicity spatial

00:07:48
and geography as a discipline whatever

00:07:50
discipline it might be but let's say

00:07:52
parallel debates going on and what we've

00:07:54
seen from the May 1980s 1990s onwards is

00:07:58
that let's say some of the concerns that

00:08:01
are geography or economic geography or

00:08:03
Human Geography at large has had really

00:08:06
started influencing other debates at the

00:08:08
same time as human geographies started

00:08:10
engaging more or let's say actively more

00:08:12
assertively with other disciplines there

00:08:15
are many many disciplines that could be

00:08:16
that could be let's say

00:08:18
mentioned here but for me some of the

00:08:20
more influential ones are anthropology

00:08:22
Urban anthropology and cultural studies

00:08:25
yeah so where geography start engaging

00:08:28
more with questions around and let's see

00:08:30
questions traditionally uh discussed in

00:08:34
anthropology or in cultural studies

00:08:35
cultural studies then topology also

00:08:37
started engaging more with less of the

00:08:39
spatial concerns of geography so this is

00:08:41
something that I will close to this

00:08:43
lecture it or open next week lecture and

00:08:46
now I'm going to close the window

00:08:47
because

00:09:03
hear the difference

00:09:07
is one reminder I have a habit of

00:09:09
talking fast so if I talk too fast just

00:09:13
raise your hands yeah this is I have the

00:09:16
very strange habit of talking faster in

00:09:18
English than I do in Dutch which would

00:09:20
be my mother tongue

00:09:22
um don't ask me why if you ask me to

00:09:23
speak German I'll still slow down but

00:09:25
that wouldn't help for let's say General

00:09:27
comprehension in this class I think okay

00:09:31
first part cultural turn or cultural

00:09:34
turns

00:09:35
um

00:09:36
the slides are all uploaded so in that

00:09:38
sense you don't have to sort of type

00:09:40
like crazy just try to focus on the main

00:09:43
uh the main elements and try to go the

00:09:45
flow of the argument and trying to

00:09:46
develop

00:09:48
some of you will notice some of you will

00:09:49
not it really depends a bit I think on

00:09:51
your on your educational background yeah

00:09:53
I would assume that those were the

00:09:55
social sciences especially Humanity

00:09:56
backgrounds will be more familiar with

00:09:58
this debate than those let's say coming

00:10:00
from an engineering background but it

00:10:02
much depends a bit on the specificities

00:10:04
also which countries you have studied

00:10:06
so some take-home messages what is the

00:10:09
cultural term the cultural terms it's

00:10:10
part of a wider shift since I would

00:10:12
argue the late 1970s at least since this

00:10:16
period that it was phrased as such in

00:10:18
research practices in Humanities and

00:10:20
social sciences yeah so there are

00:10:22
various interrelated claims so that's

00:10:24
why I talk about cultural turns in a way

00:10:26
because it's not that easy to identify

00:10:28
one single shift in research practices

00:10:31
one is empirical and that simply argues

00:10:35
well simply argues culture is becoming

00:10:37
increasingly important in advanced

00:10:39
societies Advanced societies being a

00:10:42
code word for Western Europe and North

00:10:43
America basically yeah so

00:10:45
knowledge-based sites Advanced societies

00:10:47
post-industrial societies whatever term

00:10:49
you prefer so this is the first claim

00:10:52
being made as to why there is and or

00:10:54
should be a cultural term yeah culture

00:10:57
is simply becoming more important

00:10:59
um and you've opened the question what

00:11:01
Dan is culture about let's just assume

00:11:03
that it refers to the arts film media

00:11:06
whatever right so adult should become

00:11:08
more important

00:11:09
this relates to a second's plane which

00:11:12
is theoretical

00:11:14
we need better theories to grasp better

00:11:18
cultural dimensions of the social yeah

00:11:20
referring usually to symbols effects

00:11:23
meaning making practices yeah

00:11:26
the one that doesn't necessarily relate

00:11:28
to the second principle you could have

00:11:30
no change let's say an empirical

00:11:32
phenomena but simply saying well but you

00:11:34
really understand these old phenomena

00:11:35
better we need theories that capture

00:11:38
this the culturals let's say dimensions

00:11:41
of this phenomena better yeah but

00:11:44
obviously when we talk about the

00:11:45
cultural turn often this comes together

00:11:46
we say Okay culture is becoming more

00:11:49
important empirically and in order to

00:11:51
really understand this better we also

00:11:52
need other theories because the theories

00:11:54
we have don't really capture this quite

00:11:55
well you know so that's the tech

00:11:57
influence the third Point again of

00:12:00
course related with methodological

00:12:02
if this is the case or also respective

00:12:04
of this we need new methods to better

00:12:06
interpret different empirical data and

00:12:09
or to interpret data differently yeah so

00:12:13
either the old data in a different way

00:12:15
or to interpret it better or to

00:12:17
interpret data differently so it's a

00:12:19
time to interpret new data uh that we

00:12:21
need different methods for this yeah

00:12:22
maybe the simplest example in the

00:12:24
current setting would be if you look at

00:12:26
the rise of social media and let's say

00:12:28
data data skills for example and let's

00:12:31
say the last 10 years it's obviously a

00:12:33
new methods have also Arisen in order to

00:12:35
be able to investigate these phenomena

00:12:37
so there's a Classics as a

00:12:38
straightforward example of how a new

00:12:40
phenomena has emerged as a society-wide

00:12:43
and we're not always able to capture it

00:12:47
with the same methods that we had before

00:12:48
so you might need different skills

00:12:50
different methods yeah I mean again

00:12:52
question mark not saying this is the

00:12:54
case but this is let's say the argument

00:12:56
is put forward because obviously with

00:12:58
let's see existing methods you can still

00:12:59
do quite quite a lot or maybe they're

00:13:02
tweaking them so that's um important key

00:13:05
in mind so that's the clay but it also

00:13:07
means you have to be let's say

00:13:08
self-reflex appear because a lot of this

00:13:10
involves let's see claims about the

00:13:13
cultural turn does things better yeah

00:13:15
but then of course you always have to

00:13:16
ask yourself okay but better compared to

00:13:18
what right there's often a kind of

00:13:20
simplification of disciplinary histories

00:13:22
because that we say let's say within

00:13:23
urban geography it's a Well we need to

00:13:26
cultural turn because we need more

00:13:28
qualitative matters before all these old

00:13:30
guys just did quantitative methods yeah

00:13:32
it's just the data crunching this is not

00:13:34
what we need we need to do new matters

00:13:36
and there's like yeah if you look

00:13:38
superficially at that history that might

00:13:40
be the case but if you look more closely

00:13:42
you will see all kinds of different

00:13:43
strands in let's say the 100 or more

00:13:46
than 100 Years of urban studies research

00:13:48
that actually come very close to some of

00:13:51
the claims here made here yeah so that's

00:13:53
the ethnographic research for example

00:13:55
took place before but it's the same so

00:13:57
it really leads to a simplification of

00:13:59
often that's a disciplinary histories

00:14:01
and you need to be quite quite careful

00:14:04
the same arguments around let's say the

00:14:05
industrial and the post-industrial the

00:14:07
post-industrial is not completely new no

00:14:08
but it tends to actually foreground

00:14:10
different trends that might have existed

00:14:13
at a previous phase also but in a last

00:14:16
not in a sense of dominance so this is

00:14:17
important to keep in mind

00:14:21
yes

00:14:23
I don't hear anything sorry

00:14:26
what's your question

00:14:32
I'm afraid because I don't see it

00:14:36
I can have a go on this one but

00:14:40
only I don't have the problem with not

00:14:42
speaking loud enough but I'll see let me

00:14:44
see

00:14:45
yeah the building is awful is

00:14:47
building works also yeah

00:14:49
see I don't hear anything what you're

00:14:51
saying

00:14:52
check

00:14:56
if you're going to dream this morning

00:14:58
last year has all worked quite well but

00:14:59
everything slowly everything is falling

00:15:01
apart give it one year

00:15:05
because there's also not much I can

00:15:06
actually do here

00:15:16
it's all on that but you won't hear me

00:15:17
will you

00:15:18
yeah

00:15:23
and it's awesome I'm afraid this is not

00:15:25
working

00:15:28
thank you

00:15:30
no sorry I could do about it all right

00:15:34
I'll try to speak a bit louder and a bit

00:15:36
slower but there's nothing I can do

00:15:38
about the building usually buildings are

00:15:40
installing five yeah I mean what the

00:15:41
hell anyways

00:15:45
um

00:15:49
so these are some of the main shifts

00:15:51
that you should understand as being part

00:15:53
of let's say the cultural term the

00:15:54
cultural Turks yes just to give you some

00:15:57
quick examples of let's say uh offers

00:16:00
the foundational books that that might

00:16:02
act as a reference reference of let's

00:16:05
say exemplifying the cultural turn

00:16:07
this is getting better yeah so

00:16:10
exemplifying the cultural turn

00:16:13
yes

00:16:14
I'm wondering how people look on this at

00:16:16
panopto they don't understand anything

00:16:18
of this so anyways

00:16:20
um

00:16:21
Frederick Jameson coming from literary

00:16:23
cultural Theory who I will discuss in

00:16:25
some detail precisely because some of

00:16:27
his elements uh some of his arguments

00:16:29
are let's say really foundational thing

00:16:31
for much of urban studies in this

00:16:34
particular strand of research but you

00:16:36
see it also political science and

00:16:37
historical sociology stage formation

00:16:40
after the cultural turn uh really

00:16:42
looking at you could say meaning making

00:16:44
practices State imaginary some terms

00:16:46
that maybe now have become quiet

00:16:49
let's see natural really uh to to think

00:16:52
about what the state is but perhaps from

00:16:54
let's say an earlier institutional point

00:16:57
of view we're not so much the case yeah

00:16:59
so

00:17:00
and as you see many of these claims were

00:17:02
made or cultural and economy after the

00:17:04
cultural turn yeah

00:17:07
foreign

00:17:10
but it really doesn't help for the

00:17:11
Acoustics right

00:17:13
so looking at organizations much more

00:17:15
from a cultural perspective that is not

00:17:17
just about the organization and let's

00:17:19
say a functional manner but also about

00:17:21
again meeting making practices ways of

00:17:24
Behaving uh within organizations

00:17:28
um anthropology and history history

00:17:31
sociology Etc you could name many many

00:17:33
of these books but they all at that

00:17:35
point in time and it was all around late

00:17:37
1980s throughout the 1990s that these

00:17:40
kinds of claims were made most

00:17:42
forcefully in in academic literature

00:17:46
now to Frederick Jameson every year wait

00:17:49
it sounds a bit harsh but every year I

00:17:51
have to check online if he's not that

00:17:52
yet because he was born in 1934-4 but I

00:17:56
don't think he's that active anymore but

00:17:57
he would think he was pretty active

00:17:59
until five to ten years ago which in

00:18:00
itself uh is quite achievement he has

00:18:03
published an enormous amount of books

00:18:05
and articles

00:18:06
uh is a professor or Emeritus professor

00:18:09
of comparative literature at Duke

00:18:11
University and has become I'll put I

00:18:14
just put some passwords here has become

00:18:16
very famous for Marxist literary

00:18:18
cultural theory for debates obviously on

00:18:20
around modernity and post-modernity and

00:18:23
also for the relation to culture and

00:18:25
political economy so if these buzzwords

00:18:28
should already give a bit of an

00:18:29
explanation let's ask them how he

00:18:31
interprets culture because he has a

00:18:33
strong you see Marxist but in a very

00:18:35
let's see open manner but especially

00:18:37
this is important so he always looks at

00:18:39
the relation of culture to political

00:18:41
economy which is basically a code word

00:18:43
for capitalism yeah so this is I would

00:18:45
say I would say his main concern in his

00:18:48
writings at least on on culture and

00:18:50
postmodernism

00:19:00
now there's a phrase that has become

00:19:02
well this is also his article originally

00:19:04
published in 1984.

00:19:06
which he died which he titled

00:19:08
post-modernism as the cultural logic of

00:19:11
late capitalism yeah so this is really

00:19:13
let's say a phrase that has become very

00:19:15
famous also you see it referred to

00:19:18
um on a regular basis now there are a

00:19:21
number of elements I don't know who has

00:19:22
wrapped to the article I'm not going to

00:19:24
ask I'm not even going to ask who has

00:19:25
actually managed to finish the article

00:19:27
because it's not a simple article I am

00:19:29
very well aware of this

00:19:31
um it is worth it I mean have a drink

00:19:33
sit down late evening and you'll maybe

00:19:36
understand it better uh

00:19:38
who knows

00:19:40
um but it really is uh I'm I'm trying to

00:19:43
give you also let's say some

00:19:44
foundational original literatures not

00:19:45
just about secondary literature artists

00:19:47
writing about other artists but this is

00:19:49
the is a is an article related to book

00:19:52
that is let's say it's referenced all

00:19:54
the time so it really helps to go back

00:19:56
to the original uh to get a sense of

00:19:58
what is arguing now I picked to do your

00:20:01
homework I picked some as a key quotes

00:20:03
from from this article which in a way

00:20:06
give a good summary of what this claim

00:20:08
is about and which shaped I think some

00:20:09
of the urban research later on

00:20:13
first he says of course modernism is not

00:20:15
a style but it acts or it is a cultural

00:20:18
dominant yeah

00:20:19
so it's not just a lifestyle question no

00:20:22
it's actually something that has become

00:20:23
dominant in our contemporary culture

00:20:26
second

00:20:27
and directly related aesthetic

00:20:29
production today and this is of course

00:20:30
where let's see it's Marxist on as the

00:20:32
political economy sympathies show a

00:20:35
static production today has become

00:20:37
integrated into commodity production uh

00:20:40
generally yeah so it's really difficult

00:20:42
he argues to distinguish aesthetic

00:20:45
production and production of the Arts

00:20:47
symbolic entities from Commodities yeah

00:20:50
so it basically becomes one two sides of

00:20:52
the same coin that's basically what

00:20:54
she's arguing yeah I think if you start

00:20:56
thinking empirically it's quite easy to

00:20:59
come up with concrete example of

00:21:00
anything oh yeah that makes a lot of

00:21:01
sense yeah a work of art let's see a

00:21:04
painting is at the same time let's say

00:21:07
aesthetic production yeah it's about

00:21:09
symbolic and meaning making practices

00:21:11
yes about interpretation but it's also

00:21:14
sells on the Art Market yeah and it's

00:21:15
not to do with speculation so it's both

00:21:18
you know

00:21:19
that historic elements

00:21:21
I'll skip this because it's interesting

00:21:23
but there's a very let's say 1980

00:21:25
sentiment where sort of globalization

00:21:27
and Americanization was very much seen

00:21:29
as one of the same thing or

00:21:30
globalization was seen as you could see

00:21:32
an extension uh of an earlier history of

00:21:35
Americanization yeah

00:21:37
and then he talks about it this again

00:21:39
becomes very important I said well

00:21:40
basically he looks at postmodernism as

00:21:43
the third stage of capital capitalism uh

00:21:46
referring to Alice Mandel was a market

00:21:49
scholar actually at this University many

00:21:51
many years ago

00:21:52
um which would then be a uses different

00:21:54
terminologies for it he refers to

00:21:57
post-industrial capitalism because the

00:21:59
base capitalism to multinational

00:22:00
capitalism or to Consumer capitalism

00:22:02
yeah so you could argue this all here is

00:22:06
the politically political economy policy

00:22:09
political economy side of postmodernism

00:22:13
yeah so post-modernism accompanies this

00:22:16
phase of capitalism yeah that also means

00:22:18
according to to Jameson it only makes

00:22:22
sense to talk about postmodernism from

00:22:24
let's say the mid 1970s onwards there is

00:22:27
no such thing in this way of reasoning

00:22:29
as post-modernism in the 1920s just

00:22:32
doesn't make any sense yeah because it's

00:22:34
so much tied to a particular face or

00:22:36
particular stage of capitalism

00:22:42
one reason why this article has become

00:22:43
quite famous and it's a bit more

00:22:45
difficult to understand now I think is

00:22:46
because he does quite an extensive re uh

00:22:49
reading and interpretation of one

00:22:51
particular hotel which is the

00:22:52
bonaventura hotel

00:22:54
um in Los Angeles

00:22:56
so uh designed by John Portman built in

00:22:59
the mid-1970s and one of the largest

00:23:01
hotels in La and to my knowledge uh it's

00:23:04
it still is

00:23:06
so just some pictures

00:23:08
this this hotel for him it's a bit hard

00:23:10
to imagine now but it's if you look

00:23:13
represents you could say the culmination

00:23:15
of post-modernism as the late logic as

00:23:18
the elastic logic of of late capitalism

00:23:23
so what does he argue here you will see

00:23:25
that some of these elephants return in

00:23:27
later debates without reference to the

00:23:28
hotel or the specificity of his his

00:23:30
argument it aspires to be a total space

00:23:33
a complete world and an attempt to not

00:23:36
be a part of the city yeah so it tends

00:23:38
to be a world on its own yeah

00:23:41
to not be a part of the sea so it has a

00:23:44
reflective glass skin which repels the

00:23:46
city

00:23:47
outside and achieves The Peculiar and

00:23:49
placeless dissociation of the

00:23:52
bonaventura from its neighborhood yeah

00:23:55
just keep this in mind somebody's else

00:23:56
because they will return later yeah but

00:23:58
it is separate from the city so it's

00:24:00
quite a quite easy to imagine later and

00:24:02
I'll give some examples also if you

00:24:04
think of let's say gated community style

00:24:06
things right things that are let's say

00:24:07
within the city but cities are highly

00:24:10
unequal so you have different elements

00:24:11
let's say separate even though they're

00:24:13
formally speaking part of the sea this

00:24:15
is what he's arguing at that this is

00:24:17
what we see in the Bonaventure Hotel and

00:24:19
then this becomes a bit more difficult

00:24:21
to imagine now because it really is I

00:24:23
think an experience of that time I think

00:24:25
we're now so used to these kinds of

00:24:27
architectures and these kinds of

00:24:28
buildings but here according to him this

00:24:31
becomes impossible to navigate they have

00:24:33
postmodern hyperspace I'll skip that is

00:24:36
impossible to navigate yeah it's just

00:24:38
too confusing in any way you can no

00:24:40
longer situate yourself as a subject

00:24:43
within this world but you're just very a

00:24:45
very fragmented human being that was a

00:24:47
kind of let's say a typical let's say

00:24:49
literary Trope of 1980s post-modernism I

00:24:53
think this has probably become us

00:24:55
Central to the debate most likely

00:24:58
because we have so we have become so

00:25:00
used to behaving like this in the world

00:25:11
again I want to discuss these in detail

00:25:13
I'll skip the first this one might be

00:25:15
important to remember here because again

00:25:16
this shows up and later discussions

00:25:18
especially when we think about

00:25:19
discussions around cultural heritage

00:25:21
yeah his stories isn't a thesis history

00:25:24
a random cannibalization of all the

00:25:26
styles of the past and this idea that

00:25:28
especially post-modern architecture just

00:25:31
use different elements for different

00:25:33
eras and combined us into a new building

00:25:36
yeah so it didn't produce let's say

00:25:38
formally speaking something new but it

00:25:40
was more of Rico large a combination of

00:25:43
all kinds of existing let's say

00:25:45
architectural Styles yeah so a random

00:25:47
categorization of the cells of the past

00:25:48
the past as a reference finds itself

00:25:51
gradually bracketed leaving us nothing

00:25:52
with nothing but text yeah

00:25:56
so this is also again something that

00:25:58
pops up in later discussions uh on okay

00:26:01
what what do let's say

00:26:03
um

00:26:04
what what does let's say culture

00:26:05
actually produce and there's this idea

00:26:07
that the postmodern that it well we've

00:26:08
actually reached a post-modern phase but

00:26:11
there's no linear trajectory if there

00:26:12
ever was let's say between history and

00:26:15
future it's just a recycling of the past

00:26:17
yeah

00:26:25
okay

00:26:26
now that's Jameson

00:26:29
does that make a bit more sense than

00:26:31
when you read the text

00:26:34
yeah

00:26:36
okay

00:26:37
um

00:26:39
now I mentioned Jameson

00:26:41
um not because I like my old almost dead

00:26:43
white man but um but because he really

00:26:46
has been inspirational I think for many

00:26:48
let's say researchers that came after

00:26:49
from different different perspectives

00:26:51
also yeah the Los Angeles School of

00:26:54
urbanism is one of La cities

00:26:57
um let's see cluster or a cluster of

00:26:59
activity that came together from the mid

00:27:01
1980s onwards and we should also refer

00:27:03
to James in order to build on it in a

00:27:05
more you could say social scientific

00:27:07
Urban research type type of manner

00:27:11
what does the Los Angeles School of

00:27:12
urbanism argue and I'll deconstruct this

00:27:14
idea that it is a career in school but

00:27:16
that is sad to argue

00:27:19
first of all following Jameson literally

00:27:21
following Jameson it looks at the

00:27:23
post-modern condition as a radically new

00:27:26
Urban condition yeah so this is what

00:27:28
they call post-modern urbanism yeah main

00:27:31
characteristics and again be aware of

00:27:34
let's say the simplification of

00:27:35
disciplinary histories because it does

00:27:37
it does have especially in this let's

00:27:39
say

00:27:40
foundational text or a text that try to

00:27:42
let's say really put let's say the LA

00:27:45
School of urbanism on the map through a

00:27:47
number of key Publications it did have a

00:27:49
tendency to then say okay but everything

00:27:51
that came before in a way it was

00:27:53
it's old hat we don't want that we need

00:27:55
something new so yeah very very strong

00:27:58
sense of simplification for some of the

00:28:01
main characteristics self self-defined

00:28:04
Beyond Chicago school what we see now is

00:28:07
not you could say eccentric City but no

00:28:10
it's about Urban fragmentation yeah

00:28:13
it understands LA and Southern

00:28:15
California as privileged cases so the

00:28:18
priority case for doing research but

00:28:20
also as a prototypical case in the sense

00:28:22
that they understood LA and Southern

00:28:24
California as the future of other cities

00:28:27
across the world yeah look at what we

00:28:29
see happening in LA and this region this

00:28:32
is what we will see happening in cities

00:28:33
across the world yeah so it's kind of

00:28:35
three figures let's see future Urban

00:28:38
developments yeah

00:28:40
it paid a lot of attention to

00:28:42
restructuring which was like say the

00:28:44
generic word focusing mostly on

00:28:46
post-forwardism flexible accumulation

00:28:48
the the Redevelopment of firms so I

00:28:51
won't go into this because I think

00:28:52
you're all aware by now of let's say

00:28:54
let's say uh yeah post fordism basically

00:28:58
yeah

00:29:00
um and there's a nice quote from Mike

00:29:02
Davis a writer analytical writer

00:29:06
uh belonging more or less to the same

00:29:08
scene in a way where we talked about the

00:29:11
LA School of urbanless saying well

00:29:12
they're basically politically economists

00:29:13
with their spacesuits on not quite sure

00:29:16
to fully understand what he means it but

00:29:18
it looks really it sounds really nice as

00:29:19
a as a quote

00:29:21
so it gives you a sense it's politically

00:29:23
economy but it's a bit off it's

00:29:24
something else right it's a bit

00:29:26
speculative

00:29:32
foreign

00:29:37
it's important again to be aware of

00:29:39
simplification of disciplinary histories

00:29:41
and it also applies to the LA school as

00:29:44
such yeah so it was all it was soon seen

00:29:47
as a coherent school but it was also

00:29:50
soon critiqued by others and even by

00:29:52
those within working within this domain

00:29:54
or that was let's say label as being

00:29:56
part of the LA School of urbanism saying

00:29:58
well actually there's not one single

00:30:00
claim being made by the LA School of

00:30:02
urbanism but actually there's more

00:30:04
diversity within this supposed school so

00:30:07
there is a diversity within coherence

00:30:09
perhaps so I would argue there are a

00:30:12
number of different lines of research

00:30:14
which in itself have older histories

00:30:16
longer histories but it really came

00:30:19
together at this point in time and I

00:30:21
think it still shapes to some extent uh

00:30:23
to quite a substantial extent here

00:30:25
current research that we are doing today

00:30:27
yeah so one important traps which has

00:30:30
become even the most

00:30:32
famous one is more

00:30:34
political economy economic geography I

00:30:37
guess really looks at postpartism

00:30:39
flexible accumulation industrial

00:30:41
organization Regional development so

00:30:43
really about the transformation of firms

00:30:46
how firms relate to each other how they

00:30:47
connect yeah and what this means for

00:30:49
regional development yeah

00:30:52
let's see the key artist there to

00:30:53
mention of perhaps Alan Scott Susan

00:30:55
Christopherson Michael stalker most of

00:30:57
you will have heard of these names at

00:30:59
least yeah

00:31:01
however there are also other lines of

00:31:02
work one thing I mean this problem is to

00:31:04
some extent most related to First a

00:31:07
political economy of place because if

00:31:09
you look at let's say Regional

00:31:10
development the transformation of

00:31:12
companies there's also an element there

00:31:14
okay what does this mean actually for

00:31:15
let's say local place conditions it has

00:31:18
to do with Place identity but it also

00:31:20
has to do with branding elements it has

00:31:22
to do with let's say local patriotism or

00:31:24
it has to do with local labor markets

00:31:26
Etc yeah

00:31:27
this that leads to distance strength I

00:31:30
mean they're all related obviously

00:31:31
someone like Jennifer wolf having worked

00:31:33
on homelessness unskilled work local

00:31:35
labor markets a classic argument in this

00:31:38
literature is that the transformation of

00:31:40
of the region as a result of let's say

00:31:42
the transformation of its political

00:31:43
economy leads to more polarized labor

00:31:46
markets so we have let's say simplified

00:31:49
put in a simplified sense we have let's

00:31:52
see high earners and we have let's say a

00:31:54
very let's see if if not unskilled and

00:31:56
then it gets very low paid and

00:31:59
precariously employed workers on the

00:32:01
bottom so it leads to a more polarized

00:32:03
labor market there's also you think that

00:32:05
has been picked up later by someone like

00:32:06
Sasuke assassin working on global cities

00:32:09
yeah so that's important and this wraps

00:32:12
less I mean less famous but but let's

00:32:14
emerge now I think more Force for the

00:32:17
last 10 years is work around

00:32:18
environmental justice yeah the

00:32:20
transformation of the region has also

00:32:22
had effects on the environment at large

00:32:24
the planning issues but also uh ecology

00:32:27
issues more narrowly put and this has

00:32:30
already received some attention there

00:32:31
yes

00:32:49
I'll give I'll give some examples I

00:32:51
think later on but basically it's about

00:32:53
Urban fragmentation if I would have to

00:32:55
put it in a bus word so this idea that I

00:32:59
mean especially me for those that

00:33:00
attended my lecture on the European sea

00:33:02
there's this idea that it's a compact

00:33:04
City it's a coherent city is

00:33:05
historically grown and amazing world of

00:33:08
actually

00:33:09
it's a post-modern city it's almost

00:33:10
inverse right it just it's like a

00:33:12
chessboard where whatever you could put

00:33:13
about rationality not a good example

00:33:15
because you know it's a very clear rules

00:33:16
there but when you just like a game

00:33:19
board where you could put wherever you

00:33:20
want and this is how then the city

00:33:22
develops yeah so and this is what and so

00:33:24
this relates to Urban fragmentation and

00:33:26
the other one sprawled I would say say

00:33:28
those would be two issues where they

00:33:30
argue okay this is actually

00:33:32
foreshadowing why the urban developments

00:33:34
and they're not completely wrong of

00:33:36
course I would simply I would just argue

00:33:38
that maybe La was not the first and in

00:33:40
parallel at least we saw we see many

00:33:42
other cities where this was also the

00:33:44
case especially uh in the global South

00:33:47
um but this is I mean that's only a

00:33:49
critique that has been raised towards

00:33:52
the LA school also because it's only

00:33:54
only at a later stage I think that it

00:33:56
started looking outside of North America

00:33:58
it was a strong American bias maybe

00:34:01
Western Europe and only later that it

00:34:03
started expanding and then of course

00:34:05
somebody's theories no longer hold or

00:34:07
somebody claims in any case yeah yeah

00:34:11
okay

00:34:14
so there's a lot of diversity if you

00:34:16
look at it at the same time it must be

00:34:18
said

00:34:19
cumulatively between the mid 1980s and

00:34:22
the mid and the late 1990s various key

00:34:24
Publications were published that put La

00:34:26
really on the map of urban studies yeah

00:34:29
so and this really really helps I think

00:34:30
to to retrospectively look at this as a

00:34:34
kind of coherent La School of urbanism

00:34:36
yeah that's ranging from a 1986 special

00:34:39
issue in society of space which is one

00:34:42
of the few journals specifically

00:34:43
dedicated to LA to books like the city

00:34:46
Los Angeles and urban theory in the mid

00:34:48
1990s or rethinking LA

00:34:51
or Studies by Alan J Scott on

00:34:54
technopolis there are many many of these

00:34:56
key books that really appear to the key

00:34:58
references in the field of urban studies

00:35:00
that are still let's say dealt with or

00:35:02
referred to uh today yeah

00:35:05
well for example Mike Mike Davis as I

00:35:08
said what an academic person but his

00:35:10
famous book city of quartz which again

00:35:13
is continuously referenced in many

00:35:16
different uh parts of the urban studies

00:35:18
world and uh and Beyond

00:35:24
this one is perhaps already a partial

00:35:26
answer to your question because this

00:35:27
shows a bit in extreme I would say how

00:35:31
some of these artists looked at at city

00:35:34
development I mean I'm saying in extreme

00:35:36
because this is really an article that

00:35:37
tries to codify some of the claims that

00:35:39
were made in a more subtle manner than

00:35:41
many other orders

00:35:44
um

00:35:45
and by doing said he also radicalized

00:35:47
some of these claims not necessarily in

00:35:49
a in a helpful manner I think but it

00:35:52
helps to keep in mind

00:35:54
so they said they argue that the spatial

00:35:55
manifestation so uh the honest dear and

00:35:58
flusty so I forgot their names

00:36:00
they argue that the spatial

00:36:01
manifestation of post-modern urbanism

00:36:04
was a kind of key no capitalism Yeah so

00:36:07
basically it's apparently a board game I

00:36:09
wasn't aware of that but basically a

00:36:11
very fragmented form of an urban

00:36:13
structure in which the quote

00:36:15
urbanization is occurring on a

00:36:17
quasi-random field of opportunities Yeah

00:36:20
so basically there's no longer this idea

00:36:22
that you have a city center and then it

00:36:24
emerges outwards or there are particular

00:36:26
structures related to planning Etc no it

00:36:29
just it's pretty random yeah

00:36:31
and this is also all of course also the

00:36:34
end of theory because if you make this

00:36:35
kind of claim that does not really much

00:36:37
you can you can do anymore so it's also

00:36:40
highly let's say simplified so I would

00:36:42
certainly not encourage you to

00:36:44
understand this as the core business of

00:36:45
the LA School of urbanism this is almost

00:36:47
more a parody of the of this debate

00:36:51
nevertheless some of the lesser the

00:36:53
items literally speaking they put on the

00:36:55
map of Keto capitalism

00:36:58
still resonate with us today because for

00:37:00
example we have here at no verb which

00:37:03
you could say there's a lot of which is

00:37:05
still going on on let's say ethnic

00:37:06
communities the relation between ethnic

00:37:07
groups and let's say localities within

00:37:09
cities neighborhoods we have Team marks

00:37:12
parks sorry it's a lot of

00:37:14
commodification of public space we have

00:37:17
created communities with obviously plays

00:37:18
well we have Street Warfare So that

00:37:20
obviously there's violence in the city

00:37:22
which is a classic team in urban

00:37:23
research spectacle again which relates

00:37:26
to let's be commodification of space

00:37:28
command and Patrol centers which is

00:37:30
let's say the classic team Awards like

00:37:32
Sasuke assassin this idea that Global

00:37:34
cities are with where the action happens

00:37:36
when it comes to post-political and

00:37:38
economic rule so all these different

00:37:40
elements do

00:37:42
uh well we're identified by them and

00:37:45
have played an important role in later

00:37:46
research on this city

00:37:51
yeah I give some examples already here I

00:37:53
don't need to go through this again

00:38:01
so much my summary uh of the LA School

00:38:04
of earliest I already hint that the fact

00:38:06
that

00:38:07
this was not without its critique and

00:38:10
some of this critique was quite

00:38:11
legitimate because one of let's say my

00:38:13
hobby was is to really warn against the

00:38:15
simplification of disciplinary histories

00:38:17
there's a lot of academic laziness

00:38:19
involved you want to make a claim that

00:38:21
you do something relevant and

00:38:22
interesting and by doing that you say

00:38:24
about that what came before was actually

00:38:26
not that interesting but you actually

00:38:28
simplify that history yeah so if you're

00:38:31
intellectually I think very honest you

00:38:33
have to be very careful with these kinds

00:38:34
of strategies you have to be much more

00:38:36
or less honest and open and respectful

00:38:37
also of what came before and maybe

00:38:40
moderate your own claims to towards new

00:38:41
illness this is not what the LA school

00:38:43
did or let's say let's see some artists

00:38:45
within this field

00:38:46
so critics were also abundant and all

00:38:50
very early on raised let's say made

00:38:53
let's say problems had the issues they

00:38:56
had with let's say the claims of noon is

00:38:59
put forward by other school Earnest one

00:39:01
being what's really new here yeah

00:39:04
you might claim that this is work done

00:39:06
that hasn't received enough attention

00:39:08
but actually there's already a lot of

00:39:10
existing work on diversity restructuring

00:39:12
consumption and commodification or in

00:39:15
urban poverty yeah especially Urban

00:39:16
poverty has been foundational to riding

00:39:20
on the urban since the mid-19th century

00:39:22
yeah so there's actually an

00:39:23
industrialization basically so what's

00:39:25
really new here

00:39:27
that's the first legitimate criticism

00:39:30
second one it is

00:39:33
the LA school it really sort of reduced

00:39:36
The Chicago School

00:39:37
do a kind of Burgess concentric zone

00:39:39
model the idea that everything that was

00:39:42
written in the 1930s which is post-hoc

00:39:45
sometimes labeled as The Chicago School

00:39:47
was about the concentric zone model this

00:39:50
idea that as a central central air

00:39:52
business district and had people move

00:39:54
outwards depending on let's say history

00:39:56
and and capital also yeah there's much

00:40:00
more internal of our or there was much

00:40:01
more internal variety within the Chicago

00:40:03
school so it does not justify this kind

00:40:06
of simplification yeah so many things

00:40:08
the TLA school is now doing actually was

00:40:10
already happening in The Chicago School

00:40:12
so let's say the American claim there's

00:40:15
of course also a struggle you could say

00:40:16
within us American Academia saying well

00:40:20
we've had Chicago now we move to LA this

00:40:22
is where the action is happening and

00:40:24
then many other Arts were saying well

00:40:25
maybe not quite yeah so that's important

00:40:28
to keep in mind

00:40:29
a third one this perhaps for me the

00:40:33
most the most interesting or the most

00:40:34
relevant critique is there is truly I

00:40:38
think a kind of ethnographic void in a

00:40:40
lot of literature and post-modern

00:40:42
urbanism what do I mean by this it

00:40:43
really relies on a kind of deep text

00:40:45
reading of the city this is the most

00:40:48
let's see extreme example

00:40:50
this is how we see the city I mean if

00:40:53
there is anything more top-down than

00:40:54
this I mean it's hard to imagine right

00:40:56
it really is like okay let's hear this

00:40:57
is how we see the city but it has no way

00:41:00
at no stage do you see any engagement

00:41:03
well with what people on the ground

00:41:05
actually think about the city they live

00:41:07
in or work in yeah so it's a very sort

00:41:09
of top-down Matrix oriented reading of

00:41:12
the city so which is labeled as an

00:41:15
ethnographic void which I think is the

00:41:17
most forceful to your team yeah it has a

00:41:20
marginalized agency and interpretation

00:41:21
of Ordinary People yeah and there's no

00:41:24
so there's also no post-modernism From

00:41:27
Below you could you could imagine a kind

00:41:28
of let's say fragmented urbanism and

00:41:31
then brick collage a combination of

00:41:32
elements by people making making do

00:41:36
making a living in a city and combining

00:41:38
different elements but none of that is

00:41:39
part of this discussion okay so it's a

00:41:42
Much More Much Too dubbed down too too

00:41:44
detached reading

00:41:46
last critique and they said it relates a

00:41:49
bit to this idea that La pre-figures

00:41:51
wider Urban developments they're saying

00:41:54
well la is actually not that radically

00:41:56
different on two levels uh first within

00:42:00
La existing Urban theories before the LA

00:42:03
School of urbanism are still relevant to

00:42:06
explain what happens in la la is not a

00:42:10
complete free let's say board with

00:42:13
quasi-random uh let's say activities

00:42:16
taking place no you can use all the

00:42:17
theories around let's say agglomeration

00:42:19
for example in order to understand LA or

00:42:22
in this wider region so that's one thing

00:42:24
the other side is that the empirical

00:42:26
phenomena we see in LA are also visible

00:42:29
elsewhere and not just as a prefiguring

00:42:32
not something that comes after the other

00:42:34
school urbanists talked about La no but

00:42:37
actually something that was already

00:42:38
before maybe some cities were even

00:42:40
earlier and the other thing is also to

00:42:42
some extent where especially research is

00:42:45
working in the global Styles uh really

00:42:47
connected to right say okay there's much

00:42:50
happening elsewhere which is perhaps

00:42:52
more interesting also and certainly

00:42:54
shows let's say that La is not that

00:42:56
special after all

00:43:01
okay

00:43:04
wow went fast yeah

00:43:10
get off the screen

00:43:19
questions

00:43:45
well I mean I would

00:43:48
I would situate that a bit I would say

00:43:50
certain strands within geography this

00:43:52
was at least what what you're saying but

00:43:55
if you look at much of this literature

00:43:56
especially worked by people like Alexis

00:43:59
and Christopherson they're all working

00:44:01
in a kind of realist vein right in the

00:44:04
sense of it's pretty straightforward

00:44:06
Empirical research right there's a world

00:44:08
out there we're going to study it some

00:44:10
of the examples you mentioned might have

00:44:12
happened but I would say that was more

00:44:14
or less a visible or more Central to the

00:44:15
debate in literary studies it may be

00:44:18
cultural studies to some extent and less

00:44:20
so in geography

00:44:21
so um I don't think it was necessarily A

00:44:24
in when it came to the LA School of

00:44:26
urban is the necessary much reflection

00:44:28
actually on the epistemological the

00:44:30
methodological Dimension and it was more

00:44:32
an observation of new empirical facts on

00:44:35
the ground which necessitated new

00:44:37
theories according to them so I think

00:44:39
it's more on that level but obviously I

00:44:42
mean as I said at the very end there is

00:44:43
no such thing as one cultural turn and

00:44:46
also no such thing as one force

00:44:47
modernism so I think that's uh and if

00:44:50
you look at the way a term such as the

00:44:52
postmodern has been um let's say discuss

00:44:55
within different disciplines you see

00:44:57
quite radical differences between what

00:45:00
is actually understood by the postmodern

00:45:02
in the first place and there are

00:45:04
interesting books written on this also

00:45:05
but yeah that yeah

00:45:08
okay other questions on these first

00:45:10
three was it two more substantial parts

00:45:16
nope

00:45:21
um how are we doing time wise yeah let's

00:45:23
give it a few more minutes and then

00:45:24
we'll see

00:45:25
um am I talking too fast or is it

00:45:28
okay-ish I think the fact that I have to

00:45:31
speak very loud automatically slows me

00:45:33
down right so that helps in a way so I

00:45:35
might just start screaming in my

00:45:37
lectures and then I'll I'll slow down my

00:45:40
Tempo yeah

00:45:42
foreign

00:45:50
so we've got cultural term we've got

00:45:53
postmodern let's say jamesonian

00:45:55
approaches a sort of Vision on the

00:45:58
postmodern

00:45:59
this indirectly or directly influence a

00:46:02
lot of La school urbanism work yeah I

00:46:04
think it was not just Jameson but there

00:46:06
are many many that see similarities

00:46:07
there and there's a related strand which

00:46:10
now I want to discuss with you which I

00:46:12
would call as the urban Landscapes and

00:46:13
symbolic economy mostly because this is

00:46:16
the terminology that was

00:46:18
that I mean the different strands of

00:46:20
research but there's a lot of research

00:46:21
around these this kind of teams which

00:46:24
supposedly refer to actual facts on the

00:46:26
ground so don't see it as something

00:46:28
completely different from let's say the

00:46:30
other school of urban is more let's say

00:46:33
developing in parallel perhaps also a

00:46:35
different inspiration it's coming a bit

00:46:37
more I would argue from black City

00:46:38
Cultural studies tradition which also

00:46:40
emerged in the 1980s yeah but obviously

00:46:42
their interactions also so just uh to

00:46:45
know as a clear cut categories here

00:46:48
if you look at what I now describe as

00:46:50
let's say one body of literature because

00:46:51
for me it makes sense to describe this

00:46:53
as a relatively coherent body of

00:46:55
literature there are a number of key

00:46:57
guiding assumptions arguments shaping

00:47:00
this kind of literature one very similar

00:47:02
to Jameson flexible accumulation

00:47:05
post-forwardism and post-modernism are

00:47:07
two sides of the same coin so this is

00:47:09
your Marx's argument right so there's a

00:47:11
political economy and the culture as you

00:47:13
can see that let's see the other side of

00:47:16
this political economy but it's it's

00:47:18
it's it's impossible to extract it just

00:47:21
belongs very closely together

00:47:24
and Innovation perhaps that this

00:47:26
literature introduced is it's according

00:47:28
to the much of this literature says well

00:47:30
we see the rise of postmodernism also

00:47:33
hanging together with the rise of a new

00:47:35
middle class yeah and this very much

00:47:37
hangs together again with just a rise of

00:47:40
post-fortism post-industrialism because

00:47:42
it Latin new you could say work

00:47:44
opportunities new fields of work new

00:47:47
labor markets which demand that you

00:47:49
could say uh a uh a a a type of worker a

00:47:53
type of population that was overall

00:47:55
Highly Educated that was knowledge

00:47:57
oriented yeah so this is the kind of

00:47:59
debate around higher education

00:48:01
knowledge-based capitalism and this was

00:48:03
very much seen as it's higher educated

00:48:05
and this is what they should understood

00:48:07
to be the rise of a new middle class

00:48:09
yeah it's not your classic middle class

00:48:11
which perhaps massive more fixed but and

00:48:14
this is the introduction that was done

00:48:16
here say okay this rise of the numeral

00:48:18
class

00:48:19
is accompanied by a device or an

00:48:22
interest and new you could say aesthetic

00:48:24
sensibility sensitivities interests

00:48:27
preferences yeah this idea that there's

00:48:29
a new kind of Aesthetics emerging with

00:48:32
this new group of people yeah which they

00:48:34
labeled and commodity Aesthetics in a

00:48:36
way that because was highly driven or

00:48:39
widely related to let's say lifestyle

00:48:40
preferences yeah

00:48:42
I'm interested come up with a good

00:48:45
example I'm interested I work for let's

00:48:47
say a

00:48:49
not I can't come up with a good example

00:48:51
I try to come up with a better example

00:48:52
here

00:48:53
I'll give examples in a minute yes it

00:48:55
doesn't really matter

00:48:57
um

00:48:58
[Music]

00:49:00
no because the kinds of examples I was

00:49:01
thinking about are mostly around let's

00:49:04
say Urban Street culture for example

00:49:05
which is very much related to particular

00:49:07
let's say the lifestyles that really

00:49:10
lead to let's say how you identify with

00:49:12
particular Lifestyles and these

00:49:13
lifestyles are closely connected to the

00:49:15
buying and showing of particular

00:49:17
Commodities yeah shoes clothes

00:49:20
artworks that you affiliate that you

00:49:22
associate with if you're a bit higher up

00:49:25
Etc

00:49:26
so let's say the second part third one

00:49:28
is that culture was key or is key to

00:49:30
Urban Redevelopment this has remained I

00:49:33
think very influential I'm doing work on

00:49:35
this still but there's also his work

00:49:36
that was already let's say put forward

00:49:39
and started being done in the late 1980s

00:49:41
work being done on real estate on

00:49:43
artists on on representations of urban

00:49:46
space yeah if you think now of work

00:49:48
being done on the impact of of

00:49:51
gentrification yeah on on City spaces

00:49:54
how artists play a role in both let's

00:49:56
say boosting gentrification but also

00:49:59
being kicked out of gentrifying areas

00:50:01
That's a classic argument which Harris

00:50:03
you can already made in the early you

00:50:05
know in the mid 1980s so not much has

00:50:08
changed you could say in that in that

00:50:10
respect

00:50:11
and the fourth role I think this is

00:50:13
something that was relatively new

00:50:14
perhaps also picked up more on the

00:50:16
European side of the discussion and

00:50:18
which was not really at all really

00:50:20
picked up by the by the alley School of

00:50:22
urbanism is an important role of the

00:50:25
state yeah staying investing in cultural

00:50:27
landmarks but also really developing all

00:50:29
kinds of cultural economic policies yeah

00:50:32
so this is what more or less it would

00:50:34
have to give let's say a nutshell

00:50:35
definition or a listing of key elements

00:50:38
what the symbolic economy literature is

00:50:41
more or less about

00:50:46
few examples

00:50:48
one interesting article that Paul Knox

00:50:50
the rest of those Urban landscape early

00:50:52
1990s where we argued very much along

00:50:56
jamesonian lines there's widespread

00:50:58
agreements that the emergence of

00:51:00
post-modern architecture culture and

00:51:03
philosophy in Western Society has

00:51:06
proceeded in tandling with the emergence

00:51:09
of globalized more flexible forms of

00:51:11
capitalist Enterprise

00:51:13
or second part of that quote

00:51:15
post-modernism as the cultural closing

00:51:18
of advanced capitalism you know so this

00:51:20
is basically Jameson all over again this

00:51:23
idea two sides of the same goal I

00:51:25
register a question here because I mean

00:51:27
I would question if there was really

00:51:29
that kind of widespread agreement yes

00:51:32
there was widespread agreement on this

00:51:34
claim within Marx's political economy

00:51:37
and yes marxian political economy became

00:51:40
let's say especially within geography

00:51:42
that's a pretty not dominant But Central

00:51:45
to the debate I would say in the 1980s

00:51:47
and 1990s or especially in the early

00:51:49
1990s and this is part of that kind of

00:51:52
explanatory logic yeah I personally I

00:51:55
mean I mean see much to agree with and

00:51:58
these kinds of claims but I don't think

00:51:59
actually that that let's say cultural

00:52:02
expressions are always that easily the

00:52:04
other side of the same coin of the of

00:52:07
let's say the capitalist political

00:52:09
economy yeah so if there's more

00:52:10
complexity there that is easily let's

00:52:13
say simplified

00:52:15
um so this is important to keep in mind

00:52:18
unless of course you fully agree with

00:52:19
this argument which is which is possible

00:52:23
foreign

00:52:35
so the point about the rise of a new

00:52:36
Miller Glass again in the same article

00:52:38
knocks offers a quite a useful summary I

00:52:41
find

00:52:42
yeah it makes a couple of claims which

00:52:44
is not specific to Knox but I think

00:52:46
specific or or representative let's say

00:52:48
this wider literature

00:52:49
first he says well and this is the shift

00:52:51
to post industrialism the emergence of

00:52:54
new class fractions under Advanced

00:52:56
capitalism yeah so we see dominant

00:52:59
classes but actually they change over

00:53:00
time but so the structurally speaking

00:53:02
let's say this hierarchy remains but

00:53:04
different class fractions might emerge

00:53:07
to become dominant this is what not

00:53:09
under Advanced capitalism you see the

00:53:11
emergence of new class fractions or the

00:53:13
new middle class under Advanced

00:53:15
capitalism

00:53:16
that's the economic arguments the

00:53:18
cultural argument would be this was also

00:53:21
a generational reaction against

00:53:23
modernist Aesthetics

00:53:25
let's see the children growing up in the

00:53:27
1960s rebelled against their modernist

00:53:30
parents and thus started proporting

00:53:32
different ways of Behaving different

00:53:33
ways of cultural preferences yeah

00:53:36
it's not wrong it's highly simplified

00:53:37
but it's not it's not wrong of course so

00:53:40
that's you could say the socio-cultural

00:53:42
uh

00:53:43
related to this this related to that

00:53:46
let's say this move away this critique

00:53:47
of of modernism you really referred more

00:53:51
to the kind of lifestyle orientation but

00:53:53
you can look at positively art becomes

00:53:55
part of everyday life yeah this is

00:53:57
something that does not use something

00:53:59
that is separate from us no it becomes

00:54:00
even more radical but you can also look

00:54:03
at it more critically or it just becomes

00:54:05
another commodity it's just a question

00:54:07
of lifestyle of showing your identity

00:54:08
showing off your identity yeah so

00:54:10
there's a lifestyle orientation

00:54:12
self-realization expression and I need

00:54:15
free responsibility cultural politics

00:54:17
true sort of culture you position

00:54:19
yourself as a citizen in many ways

00:54:24
for Local Economic explanation as

00:54:26
already into that is this kind of

00:54:27
commodity Aesthetics a kind of Niche

00:54:29
oriented consumption with emphasis on

00:54:32
tastes and Aesthetics and hence an

00:54:34
increased role for design also someone

00:54:35
like Paul Knox and later work he

00:54:38
specifically focus on Urban Design or

00:54:40
design the design sector as a central

00:54:44
sector in advanced capitalism yeah and

00:54:47
we can also we can all understand how

00:54:49
this works I mean I think we're all

00:54:50
parts in a way of this group right so I

00:54:54
wear disclosing but not that close even

00:54:56
though it's exactly the same as just a

00:54:57
slightly different color right I wear

00:55:00
these shoes but not these shoes or I

00:55:02
want wooden floors or not these kinds of

00:55:05
floors in my house depending on which

00:55:07
phased in your life your life you are

00:55:09
right it's pretty Niche but still we

00:55:12
have very strong opinions about this

00:55:13
yeah don't start talking to me about

00:55:15
music I have very strong opinions about

00:55:17
music but if I look at it for more

00:55:19
distance uh obviously I have to admit

00:55:21
that it's pretty Niche yeah so now I

00:55:24
sort of

00:55:25
um

00:55:26
let's see I uh let's say establish

00:55:28
distinctions between what is good bad or

00:55:30
better or or not as good yeah it's

00:55:33
pretty specific yeah so I think this is

00:55:35
important this is really about this

00:55:37
Niche oriented consumption that has

00:55:39
increased I think rapidly over the last

00:55:42
30 years I think this is not something

00:55:43
that we saw to such an extent

00:55:47
if you would go to the 1980s for example

00:55:49
in the early 1980s

00:55:55
cultured Urban Redevelopment so another

00:55:57
strand I would say that is really part

00:55:58
of this kind of debate

00:56:01
um even earlier indeed I forgot that

00:56:02
it's this early

00:56:04
one of the earliest probably the first

00:56:05
book actually by Sharon zukin it's

00:56:07
called love living

00:56:08
I guess most of you would also know

00:56:10
Sharon zukin who has done a lot of work

00:56:11
in culture in the city

00:56:13
and law of living was already published

00:56:16
in 1982. I think she was early for her

00:56:19
time so it's not uh you could say not

00:56:21
that typical but it was really a

00:56:23
foundational book I think and it really

00:56:25
shapes still many of the debates that

00:56:27
we're having today around the role of

00:56:29
artists in particular in urban settings

00:56:31
yeah

00:56:32
so around love living which was New York

00:56:34
oriented and there were lofts in New

00:56:36
York but there are lofts in New York

00:56:37
which of course does not apply to every

00:56:39
city but structurally speaking you can

00:56:42
see similar processes at least in larger

00:56:44
cities I would say

00:56:46
what did she argue okay we have let's

00:56:48
say abandoned moths anti-locks and we

00:56:50
see a reoccupancy of abandoned

00:56:53
structures by artists so early 1980s

00:56:55
we're talking about here also New York

00:56:57
at the height you could say of its

00:56:59
crisis and let's say at the deep end of

00:57:01
this development yeah but there's the

00:57:03
first thing a reoccupancy of abandoned

00:57:05
structures by ours this is Then followed

00:57:08
by a new middle class yeah so the

00:57:10
artists move in first it's still

00:57:12
roughing Rowdy but then the new Miller

00:57:13
class it moves in and it gets a bit more

00:57:15
a bit more let's see clean a bit more

00:57:17
fancy which she calls a reconquest of

00:57:20
the inner city

00:57:21
leading to a kind of Loft lifestyle they

00:57:24
have people living in

00:57:26
let's see dwellings that do not

00:57:28
represent your classical at certainly at

00:57:30
that point in time Suburban let's say

00:57:32
one Family household so you have to come

00:57:35
up with a new architectural style a new

00:57:37
way of imagining how to live in these

00:57:39
laws yeah

00:57:41
his size and also become an increasing

00:57:43
terrain of conflict between competing

00:57:45
users both between Alton advances if the

00:57:48
inhabitants if they were still there

00:57:49
artists and a new middle class yeah

00:57:52
where artists use Lofts also as a

00:57:54
production infrastructure to produce art

00:57:56
the new middle class by and large used

00:57:58
these laws as residential infrastructure

00:58:01
yeah and you work somewhere else yeah

00:58:04
and then culture is also in a very early

00:58:07
on especially even from the early 1980s

00:58:09
owners in New York was used to develop

00:58:12
and profit from him from an emergent

00:58:14
real estate market so real estate

00:58:16
intermediaries very early on realize

00:58:19
that ah these artists moving in suddenly

00:58:22
this area becomes interesting becomes

00:58:24
visible at the very least and thus we

00:58:27
can actually use this we can exploit

00:58:28
this this is something we can build on

00:58:30
yeah we can start identifying this we

00:58:32
can start selling this for a profit yeah

00:58:35
now this was early 1980s I mean if and

00:58:38
if I tell you this story it's pretty

00:58:40
clear I would think being you all being

00:58:42
Urban Scholars that this Rings this

00:58:45
resonates let's put it at those terms

00:58:47
resonates with discussions you see on an

00:58:49
everyday level and most of the cities

00:58:51
that you're familiar with yeah this idea

00:58:53
that ah that us identifying areas this

00:58:55
is like a Proto a proto-definition of

00:58:57
gentrification or cultural

00:58:59
gentrification yeah so when I think if I

00:59:02
think of an area such as I know in

00:59:04
Russell such as sanjul to some extent

00:59:06
this logic is followed yeah and I mean

00:59:10
I'm not familiar with too many cities

00:59:12
but I see similar things happening in

00:59:14
Berlin or so and you still see it

00:59:16
happening and saw it happening and then

00:59:18
many other cities where this is the case

00:59:21
for this has been a major strand of

00:59:24
research for quite a long time already

00:59:25
and it has been refined Etc but it still

00:59:28
shapes shapes the discussion

00:59:41
so ultimately of course there's also and

00:59:43
again this has also received research

00:59:44
attention but also means that artists

00:59:46
have become both drivers and victims of

00:59:48
Urban Development yeah it is a similar

00:59:51
article from that time ourselves

00:59:54
which shows our artists were well really

00:59:57
the earlier let's say the the movers to

01:00:00
move into a certain area and to start

01:00:02
developing the area true Building

01:00:03
Development to a lot of development or

01:00:05
other types of uh Building Development

01:00:07
but then when the the the area the

01:00:10
neighborhood had reached a certain stage

01:00:12
of development and real estate prices

01:00:14
odds then again we're in a sense moved

01:00:16
out because they couldn't no longer

01:00:18
afford uh to live there except those

01:00:20
perhaps that were smart enough to buy at

01:00:22
an early stage but this was rarely uh

01:00:24
the case but then they had so they were

01:00:26
both drivers and victims of urban change

01:00:28
and this again hasn't changed that much

01:00:31
over the last 30 years except that

01:00:33
perhaps this phenomenon has globalized

01:00:36
and it has become a much more strategic

01:00:38
uh government uh well much more let's

01:00:42
say forceful government strategy so this

01:00:45
is in a way mainstream Urban Development

01:00:46
by now

01:00:48
okay looking at the time let's take a

01:00:50
quick break uh and then I'll continue

01:00:52
with the second part or let's see the

01:00:55
the last third of the lecture

[Music]

01:11:31
all right let's continue

01:11:39
that's my first announcements

01:11:44
foreign

01:12:17
everything

01:12:33
yeah okay let's go

01:12:36
um so we're still in the symbolic

01:12:38
economy part

01:12:40
um and I'm discussing different strands

01:12:42
or what I mean this is lesson identified

01:12:44
by me so what I consider to be a

01:12:47
relatively clear and body of leadership

01:12:48
within this body of literature there are

01:12:50
a number of different strands of let's

01:12:52
say research attention yeah so before

01:12:55
and I just finished the part on let's

01:12:57
say cultural Redevelopment

01:13:00
now in last part within that section I

01:13:02
would argue really focuses on

01:13:04
representation of urban space now please

01:13:06
understand every strength that I discuss

01:13:08
I can only do so much in a two-hour

01:13:10
lecture minus the breaks But please

01:13:13
understand every strand as potential

01:13:15
let's say lives of Investigation for

01:13:17
yourself for a paper for your

01:13:19
Massachusetts whatever right just I'm

01:13:22
trying to let's say hopefully give some

01:13:24
inspiration as to what possible teams

01:13:26
possible topics are that you might want

01:13:28
to engage with in more detail so this

01:13:31
isn't also for me a bit I want to see us

01:13:33
as my role in in especially for those

01:13:36
here in their first semester of their

01:13:38
first year Masters what I see as my role

01:13:41
just giving a few let's say 400 few

01:13:44
ideas about what could potentially be

01:13:46
interesting to do more research about

01:13:47
yeah so one element here is

01:13:50
representation of urban space this is

01:13:52
probably a relatively straightforward

01:13:55
exercise where a lot of attention

01:13:57
recently and especially also outside of

01:13:59
urban studies in marketing it's

01:14:02
cruciatingly boring but still that's not

01:14:04
a discussion but we should investigated

01:14:06
the role of media and marketing in

01:14:08
putting cities on the map yeah yeah I

01:14:11
mean I should say Nuance there's a lot

01:14:13
of boring research being done in this

01:14:15
field there's also some interesting

01:14:16
research being done in this field but

01:14:18
some of this very very instrumental yeah

01:14:21
so there's this research that focuses on

01:14:23
Urban images what kind of images do we

01:14:26
have in mind when we think about cities

01:14:27
how we can really sort of change these

01:14:29
images also contested images yeah and we

01:14:32
all will have let's say City images in

01:14:34
our mind when you're not going to do the

01:14:36
quiz now whatever would ask you to sort

01:14:38
of I wouldn't mention the city I would

01:14:40
ask you to to to mention the image the

01:14:43
first image that pops up in your ads

01:14:44
then it's quite clear there will be a

01:14:46
large element of consensus I think

01:14:48
within the audience yeah Paris Eiffel

01:14:51
Tower I mean something like that right

01:14:52
so the couple of uh cliches

01:14:55
this has become increasingly important

01:14:57
and debates also around Urban tourism

01:15:00
especially European cities have always

01:15:02
been key sites for tourism yeah so

01:15:05
there's The Grand Tour there's sort of

01:15:06
let's say the upper middle classes

01:15:08
Aristocrats between let's say European

01:15:11
Elites who have let's say traveled to

01:15:14
and around Europe two different European

01:15:16
cities but this has become let's say

01:15:18
massified over the last 60 70 years

01:15:21
early after World War II yeah and it

01:15:24
just really that's it to like to its own

01:15:26
development around Urban tourism

01:15:27
explicitly of course let's see the whole

01:15:29
discussion about America yeah Airbnb

01:15:32
would also fit in here yeah this has

01:15:36
increased they also been picked up where

01:15:38
you could say it was to some extent

01:15:41
firm driven that's the entrepreneur

01:15:43
driven this has increasingly been picked

01:15:45
up by most local and National States as

01:15:48
important development strategies for the

01:15:50
local

01:15:51
government

01:15:52
and the focus on tourism as an important

01:15:55
driver for your economy it's a highly

01:15:58
volatile economy of course and this is

01:16:00
something we now see with covert well in

01:16:03
a very clear sense suddenly everything

01:16:04
falls flat and therefore that's for

01:16:07
locally conscious rely heavily on

01:16:09
tourism that's obviously is is quite a

01:16:11
disaster

01:16:13
um if we're economically speaking of

01:16:14
course socially speaking that's another

01:16:15
discussion that is a nice book also

01:16:18
that's why I just mentioned it here I'm

01:16:19
not going to discuss it

01:16:21
but in any detail by mayor Greenback

01:16:24
in a new upside branding New York how a

01:16:26
Sydney in crisis was sold to the world

01:16:28
which traces a bit let's say The

01:16:30
Branding of New York from the 1980s

01:16:32
onwards our city at let's say at the

01:16:34
bottom ends uh being confronted without

01:16:37
migration actually tried to reinvent

01:16:40
itself through its images in order to

01:16:42
become let's say more attractive again

01:16:45
open question of course if The Branding

01:16:47
has played the most important role in

01:16:49
the city becoming more attractive but

01:16:51
certainly it has played a role in this

01:16:54
okay

01:16:57
last part in the role of the states uh

01:17:00
very briefly

01:17:01
um again this is debate that has been

01:17:03
picked up both in urban studies as well

01:17:05
as outside of urban studies from a

01:17:07
cultural perspective especially in

01:17:08
literature specifically on cultural

01:17:10
policies which is a dedicated field of

01:17:12
research on its own

01:17:15
um

01:17:17
which I would say you see a couple of

01:17:18
things we see strategies aimed at really

01:17:20
developing cultural Industries I have

01:17:22
myself done research on on this whole

01:17:24
debate around cultural Industries which

01:17:26
is very much about Local Economic

01:17:28
Development this idea that you actually

01:17:30
attract artists cultural workers to your

01:17:33
city in in order to sort of develop your

01:17:36
local economies much research attention

01:17:38
has gone into this since the 1990s but

01:17:40
especially 2000s yeah there's also

01:17:43
research around large-scale events World

01:17:46
fairs art exhibitions again this has a

01:17:48
much much longer history it transcends

01:17:51
also Urban studies as a discipline

01:17:52
because if you look at let's say a

01:17:54
discipline such as art history that has

01:17:57
done excellent work on let's say

01:18:00
Arts exhibitions and World fairs from

01:18:03
the mid-19th century onwards yeah so

01:18:05
yeah we're always let's say events to

01:18:08
attract a global or this European

01:18:10
audience to your city but again this has

01:18:14
become increasingly kind of economic

01:18:16
strategy so you want to attract the

01:18:18
Olympic Games you want to attract a

01:18:20
biannual or you want to have a

01:18:23
Etc yeah there's also been increasing

01:18:25
critiqued because often there's a lot of

01:18:27
investment going into this but what

01:18:30
actually is that's it it delivers then

01:18:32
it turns out to be quite Limited

01:18:35
and more broadly I think there's

01:18:36
literature again from the 1980s all the

01:18:38
word squash related to work by zukin on

01:18:41
the Arts and the urban growth machine as

01:18:42
it was called in the 1980s certainly

01:18:44
which really focuses on let's say Arts

01:18:48
networks Elite networks and arts

01:18:50
institute Arts institutions as local

01:18:52
attractors for invert investment and

01:18:55
Urban Development yeah so there's a

01:18:57
classic example if you look at

01:18:59
sorry the museum built in the gubernet

01:19:03
museum in Bilbao that's an always

01:19:05
mentioned case when it comes to uh you

01:19:08
place a museum in a relatively run down

01:19:10
City I'm simplifying here and this

01:19:12
should really boost the local economy

01:19:14
and to some extent it did again with

01:19:16
many issues attached to it but it's not

01:19:19
completely false yeah so there this is

01:19:22
work that has received a lot of

01:19:23
attention also

01:19:27
here one more recent example uh not sure

01:19:30
if the city needed you could say this uh

01:19:33
it was certainly not a round run-down

01:19:35
City in a sense does anyone know this

01:19:36
example

01:19:42
so it's the M plus Museum in Hong Kong

01:19:44
actually which actually was just open I

01:19:45
think two one or two weeks ago two weeks

01:19:48
ago designed by star Architects Herzog

01:19:50
in the Miron uh and a well a uh a

01:19:55
typical UKC example of a city that is

01:19:57
both

01:19:59
aimed at attracting and perhaps

01:20:01
improving you would say the cultural

01:20:02
image of Hong Kong but attracting uh

01:20:04
let's say tourism to the city but also

01:20:07
as a kind of

01:20:09
uh let's see

01:20:11
advertisement for the city and to some

01:20:13
extent in a very little sense because

01:20:15
the the main building side you say is

01:20:18
one big LCD screen at the same time next

01:20:21
to being a museum so you could actually

01:20:22
sort of literally see how this is a kind

01:20:25
of commodity aesthetic right so very

01:20:27
very literal manner

01:20:31
but also for example big commercial

01:20:32
artifacts such as the Art Basel who

01:20:35
develop let's say

01:20:37
um well which is now staging I'm not

01:20:39
quite sure what the current state is

01:20:40
because also covertly messed up a lot

01:20:42
but what it was is a stage annual art

01:20:45
fairs in Basel in Miami and in Hong Kong

01:20:48
um not only do these events attract

01:20:50
wealthy Visitors by and large yeah they

01:20:52
also spend there in these cities so

01:20:54
again it becomes a kind of local

01:20:55
development machine yeah more recently

01:20:58
Art Basel also started a so-called Art

01:21:01
Basel cities initiative where I try to

01:21:03
have events in different cities which in

01:21:07
this case Buenos Aires is one example

01:21:09
which supposedly should benefit the Art

01:21:11
Basel because it can globalize more but

01:21:14
also other cities across the world who

01:21:15
do not have the annual art fairs can

01:21:17
supposedly benefit from let's see the

01:21:19
name and reputation of the art barsing

01:21:21
and we see these kinds of initiatives

01:21:23
emerging quite forcefully over the last

01:21:25
especially over the last 10-15 years

01:21:29
okay

01:21:34
last section for today and I'm actually

01:21:35
doing quite well on time so um I also

01:21:39
won't discuss this uh unless not every

01:21:42
every bullet point on the slide

01:21:46
but just as a kind of wrapping wrapping

01:21:48
up

01:21:49
to reposition let's say my my debate

01:21:52
which was let's say mostly oriented

01:21:54
within urban geography but to reposition

01:21:57
it again within a broader debate on the

01:21:59
spatial term yeah so much of what I

01:22:01
discussed was launching a geographical

01:22:02
concern or geographical concerns but the

01:22:06
spatial turn more broadly frames that

01:22:08
kind of debate foreign

01:22:11
so just to wrap up in the late 20th

01:22:14
century urban geography was heavily

01:22:16
influenced by the cultural term this I

01:22:18
discussed yeah so I related the based on

01:22:20
post-modernism and globalization yeah

01:22:22
this has had to in effect let's say the

01:22:24
epistemological methodological effects

01:22:26
was that there was an increased interest

01:22:28
in ethnography everyday life imaginaries

01:22:32
representations or in short culture yeah

01:22:35
so this is really what I think has

01:22:36
shaped much of urban geography over the

01:22:40
last uh well 30 years

01:22:42
across the social science and this is

01:22:44
how I opened my lecture of today this uh

01:22:47
cultural turn intertwined with an

01:22:49
increased interest in spatial

01:22:51
configurations so let's say urban

01:22:53
geography is already into that became

01:22:55
more interested in cultural questions

01:22:57
the cultural disciplines which I would

01:22:59
say is cultural studies and and

01:23:01
anthropology

01:23:02
became more interested in spatial

01:23:04
questions yeah

01:23:06
so there were a number of reasons for

01:23:08
this one is and I addressed this in some

01:23:11
other lectures

01:23:12
one is a kind of really post 1989

01:23:14
obsession with globalization

01:23:16
on one level one superficial level

01:23:19
globalization is or is is the end of

01:23:22
spatial questions because everything is

01:23:24
global yeah but it actually intensified

01:23:27
this concern with spatial questions

01:23:28
because it soon became clear of course

01:23:30
that it was a process that actually had

01:23:34
spatial effects the other spatial

01:23:36
process there was a stretching of social

01:23:38
relations taking place which could be

01:23:40
and and needed to be understood in a

01:23:42
spatial manner yeah connecting a to B uh

01:23:46
as a spatial effect and it leads to

01:23:48
different let's say spatial

01:23:49
configuration

01:23:51
uh social sciences Humanities sorry yeah

01:23:55
in order to be able to fit everything on

01:23:57
an already too crowded slide I had to

01:23:59
sort of

01:24:01
across the social sciences and

01:24:02
Humanities yeah so the creating interest

01:24:05
in spatial crash and spatial questions

01:24:07
and this of course is where the

01:24:08
geography starts becoming let's say an

01:24:10
inspirational discipline for other

01:24:12
disciplines this is exactly what happens

01:24:14
in the 1990s especially

01:24:17
hence an increased interaction between

01:24:19
our job to Urban methropology and

01:24:20
cultural studies which are already

01:24:22
hinted at

01:24:26
um

01:24:27
I'm only going to go quickly through

01:24:28
this but uh the the slides are slightly

01:24:30
more detailed

01:24:32
um

01:24:33
because I added these slides because not

01:24:36
let's say

01:24:38
the elements I discussed in the previous

01:24:40
slides the previous one hour and 20

01:24:42
minutes or so

01:24:44
um cover I would say most of what is

01:24:47
relevant concern the culture in urban

01:24:50
geography over the last 30 40 years

01:24:52
which is already quite a challenge to

01:24:54
fit that into a two-hour lecture but it

01:24:56
really misses also some elements so I

01:24:58
mean I propose let's say quietly let's

01:25:00
say in a way a linear trajectory of how

01:25:02
previous discussions influence current

01:25:04
discussions and that had an effect on

01:25:05
this but in parallel of course there

01:25:07
were also discussions and I just want to

01:25:09
briefly hint at it because there's again

01:25:11
these are all of us that have become

01:25:13
more or less important but they can't

01:25:15
really necessarily Trace back to some of

01:25:17
the elements to let's say Friday Jameson

01:25:19
for example

01:25:20
so there are two

01:25:22
core teams perhaps that have also really

01:25:25
shaped

01:25:26
um

01:25:27
interdisciplinary Urban studies over the

01:25:29
last couple of years and that in a way

01:25:31
have emerged more more forcefully from

01:25:34
disciplines outside of geography but

01:25:36
it's definitely let's say informing

01:25:38
Urban studies at large which for me is a

01:25:41
very interdisciplinary discipline uh

01:25:44
up to this day two elements one

01:25:47
informality second everyday life

01:25:49
informality for those that have studied

01:25:52
ethnography and topology they will they

01:25:54
will become have been well will be quite

01:25:56
familiar with this term

01:25:58
um

01:25:58
is historically and I'll give some

01:26:00
examples there a religion has looked

01:26:02
specifically on coming from also

01:26:04
Economic Development perspectives or

01:26:06
developmentalists perspectives to some

01:26:08
extent focusing on labor markets

01:26:10
precarious work migration legality

01:26:13
political governance and conversations

01:26:15
I'll unpacked this in a minute

01:26:17
everyday life partially overlapping but

01:26:20
partially coming from uh whereas this

01:26:22
tends to become simplifying you from

01:26:24
from anthropology everyday life tends to

01:26:27
come

01:26:27
but I would say is cultural studies as a

01:26:30
discipline that emerged in the 1980s

01:26:31
focusing very much on agency community

01:26:34
community building resistance off on

01:26:37
local level of Lifestyle driven

01:26:39
consumption identity media and

01:26:42
representation yeah so and precisely

01:26:45
these terms those that read the

01:26:46
newspaper provides there's this

01:26:48
obsession with some of these terms as

01:26:50
that they want to critique and that

01:26:52
emerge I think most falsely from

01:26:54
cultural studies obviously the the

01:26:56
critics have never read cultural studies

01:26:57
but that's another discussion

01:27:02
uh let me see

01:27:04
now in formality I mentioning this here

01:27:06
because this has become a special last

01:27:08
10 years Urban studies I mean there's so

01:27:10
much research taking place now on on

01:27:11
informality and the urban uh but it's

01:27:14
important to keep in mind that this was

01:27:16
already a classic team within Urban

01:27:17
anthropology and development economics

01:27:20
especially from the early 1970s onwards

01:27:23
an article always references the one by

01:27:25
Keith Hart in formal income

01:27:26
opportunities in urban employment in

01:27:28
Ghana and the title itself already makes

01:27:30
pretty clear what uh well where he

01:27:33
stands and what the topic is right it is

01:27:35
really about local labor markets it's

01:27:37
about Local Economic Development yeah

01:27:39
but what did Keith Hart and many others

01:27:41
with him argue there is a lot of and I

01:27:44
think it's something that maybe julvin

01:27:46
Hammond is lecture for European cities

01:27:48
in an organizing World also picked up on

01:27:49
what is registered to be part of the

01:27:52
economy is only part of what is what

01:27:55
what we should consider as economic

01:27:57
activities yeah so we have formal

01:27:59
economic practices businesses that pay

01:28:02
taxes and that are registered as

01:28:04
businesses but there's a lot of

01:28:06
employment Beyond these forward economic

01:28:08
practices so beyond governments Beyond

01:28:11
firms Beyond factories Beyond

01:28:13
large-scale Commerce yeah so this is

01:28:16
where the distinction between informal

01:28:18
and formal comes from yeah

01:28:20
so this is important to keep in mind

01:28:23
this of course gets slippery because in

01:28:26
some literature

01:28:27
this and this comes together right then

01:28:29
you say well actually the informal is

01:28:31
illegitimate and the formal is the

01:28:33
legitimate but that is only partial or

01:28:35
partially true I mean we can have a

01:28:36
discussion about what's legitimate

01:28:38
unless for example say we'll we'll all

01:28:40
agree that someone taking care at all of

01:28:43
their children because the constitutes

01:28:44
work but we I think we also all agree

01:28:47
that this is not illegitimate

01:28:49
well far from it right so whereas drug

01:28:53
trafficking uh is probably informal

01:28:57
because it's not registered as such but

01:28:59
many would also consider it illegitimate

01:29:01
again we can have a discussion on this

01:29:03
if that makes sense that distinction

01:29:04
yeah

01:29:06
now this is how to constantly merged and

01:29:08
this is interesting because this is one

01:29:10
of the not few cars but one of the key

01:29:12
Concepts that have really traveled from

01:29:14
the global South to Global North yeah so

01:29:17
this is where work that emerged most

01:29:18
forcefully in research on the global

01:29:21
South yeah and this is terminology

01:29:23
that's really sort of it traveled

01:29:26
it doesn't happen too often you could

01:29:28
say

01:29:30
so I mean in terms such as post-modern

01:29:32
urbanism in a way is the opposite

01:29:33
example

01:29:38
apparently

01:29:45
I'll just check in just one sec

01:29:48
now in urban anthropology if you look at

01:29:50
informality

01:29:51
it leads to a lot of research on

01:29:54
opportunities but also precarious uh

01:29:57
precarities created by unregulated

01:29:59
economic activities so there's a strong

01:30:01
interest in gender Dimensions so people

01:30:04
women working on markets working at home

01:30:07
so this is really about let's say what

01:30:09
what the bread and butter of a lot of

01:30:10
urban anthropology

01:30:12
as well as transnational Dimensions

01:30:14
particularly this Dimension I think has

01:30:15
been picked up most most clearly in

01:30:17
let's say the more cultural work uh in

01:30:19
urban studies so for example many Street

01:30:22
vendors also being transnational

01:30:23
migrants hearing a picture of LA rambla

01:30:25
and Barcelona so illegal migrants doing

01:30:28
working on the in the city

01:30:31
and it raises questions of economic

01:30:33
survival most obviously but also

01:30:35
questions of of the governors of these

01:30:37
markets of of the political identity of

01:30:40
these actors or the cultural social

01:30:42
identity of these actors and with a

01:30:44
nervous studies is a particular this

01:30:46
strand of research which has really led

01:30:47
to a boom I think of research and

01:30:50
informal uh on informal urbanism yeah

01:30:53
I'll pick up some of these elements in

01:30:55
my lecture uh next week

01:30:57
now that's very brief I mean I could

01:30:59
have two three lectures for sure on

01:31:01
informality as a concept as a practice

01:31:03
and how it's picked up in different

01:31:05
strands of research just as a kind of

01:31:07
stepping stone please understand this as

01:31:08
a stepping stone to let's say the more

01:31:10
contemporary research that I will

01:31:12
discuss next week the second strand of

01:31:15
research which hasn't been much part of

01:31:17
let's see the poorest Modern urbanism

01:31:19
Trend the symbolic economy trance is the

01:31:22
literature on everyday life I myself

01:31:24
have been partially trained in cultural

01:31:26
studies and everyday life was a concept

01:31:29
that popped up that this was like

01:31:31
regularly used all the time from the

01:31:32
late 1980s 1990s onwards it was really

01:31:36
used as a key as a key uh well topic

01:31:40
what does the term basically entail in

01:31:43
most cases because ultimately it's also

01:31:45
not more than a buzzword there's a lot

01:31:46
of theory behind it yeah but ultimately

01:31:49
it entails a key concern with Lyft

01:31:51
experiences of people and the meanings

01:31:53
constructed by subjects in their own

01:31:56
world so classic cultural concerns if

01:31:59
you wish yeah

01:32:00
so most of this leisure in in in

01:32:04
cultural studies on everyday life tends

01:32:07
to also position people as active agents

01:32:09
rather than as passive consumers or

01:32:11
passive recipients of political power so

01:32:14
this automatically leads to this kind of

01:32:15
debate on strategies versus tactics and

01:32:19
so the resistance people can have on the

01:32:21
ground in relation to see the structures

01:32:23
they are confronted they are well they

01:32:25
are confronted with

01:32:27
um

01:32:28
I'll skip this part because there's also

01:32:30
another part in anthropology which also

01:32:32
addresses this

01:32:34
um

01:32:36
and this also makes I think the everyday

01:32:38
a truly transdisciplinary concept I mean

01:32:41
again there are not too many Concepts

01:32:43
that are truly transdisciplinary I try

01:32:45
to understand Urban studies as a

01:32:46
discipline that is much broader than

01:32:48
specific disciplinary debates because

01:32:50
it's just very boring to stick to one

01:32:51
discipline yeah but the everyday has

01:32:54
really emerged from the 1970s 1980s and

01:32:57
as a truly transdisciplinary concept so

01:32:59
again similar to the postmodern I think

01:33:01
a question that was raised at the back

01:33:03
there is no such thing as one postmodern

01:33:06
if you look at different disciplines the

01:33:08
way they understand the postmodern it's

01:33:10
quite substantially different and

01:33:12
sometimes even contradictory the same

01:33:14
applies to the everyday yeah but one

01:33:16
discipline or one other says about D

01:33:18
every day might not overlap to a great

01:33:21
degree with what another author writes

01:33:23
about you every day so you really have

01:33:24
to look at disciplinary specifics in

01:33:26
order to understand it nevertheless

01:33:28
there are it is it has emerged as a as a

01:33:31
term as a concept it really connects

01:33:34
cultural Theory with philosophy with

01:33:36
Marxist is an ethnography with

01:33:38
post-structuralism with sociology and

01:33:40
with Aesthetics yeah so the many

01:33:42
interesting let's see entry points also

01:33:44
for you so for a study specifically next

01:33:47
to an unavoidable

01:33:49
uh the everyday who sees the everyday as

01:33:52
a side of utopian possibility but also

01:33:55
colonized by the commodity form so

01:33:57
that's commodity Aesthetics once again

01:33:58
you'll I can only urge you I mean of

01:34:01
course I'm not really fair is great we

01:34:02
all like him Etc but there's also a lot

01:34:05
of interesting work that has been done

01:34:06
by other artists which is perhaps

01:34:08
at least as relevant let's put it in

01:34:10
those terms uh then then I'll really

01:34:12
forever so please no no no no no more

01:34:15
papers on the right to the city I've

01:34:16
read enough of those that's

01:34:19
for example Stuart Hall and Tony

01:34:21
Jefferson classic British cultural

01:34:23
studies uh some of you might be familiar

01:34:25
with this over their work our special

01:34:27
Stuart Hall I mean if not do read this

01:34:30
work because it's pretty well it's very

01:34:32
very good

01:34:33
we're really looked looked at let's say

01:34:35
subcultures every day as a symbolic

01:34:37
opposition to a dominant order

01:34:39
I'll just mention some keywords that top

01:34:42
up here but this is terminology I think

01:34:43
which has become

01:34:45
internalized and much of her thinking

01:34:47
about Urban cultures resistance style

01:34:50
social practices subcultures growth

01:34:52
codes Urban use identity yeah

01:34:56
terminology that was not

01:34:58
used for the first time by Stuart Hall

01:35:00
and others but they really theorized it

01:35:02
and they really did something new with

01:35:03
it yeah

01:35:05
one caveat of forces especially early

01:35:08
cultural studies work it was highly

01:35:10
blind to gender the gender Dynamics yeah

01:35:13
this was I mean the picture shows that

01:35:16
it was used subculture was very much

01:35:18
around male use subconscious yeah this

01:35:21
has partially been addressed by by

01:35:22
artists such as Angeline like Robbie uh

01:35:25
who's actually my my first PhD

01:35:27
supervisor and feminist cultural studies

01:35:30
but certainly let's say it kind of

01:35:33
um underlying Trend in the early

01:35:34
cultural studies tradition that it was

01:35:36
pretty blind to to gender issues or also

01:35:38
partially intersectional other

01:35:40
intersection issues

01:35:42
from quite a different angle but again

01:35:44
it made an amazing book if I didn't book

01:35:46
you could easily read it it's very well

01:35:48
written the practice of Everyday Life by

01:35:51
Michel de Certo

01:35:53
um

01:35:54
translation obviously I think the French

01:35:56
is uh maybe 10 years older already the

01:35:59
original

01:36:00
um more poetic but maybe focused on

01:36:03
tactics tactics versus strategies uh so

01:36:07
the idea being that strategies are top

01:36:09
down and people on the street they sort

01:36:11
of engage with this and develop tactics

01:36:14
in order to avoid

01:36:15
State strategies mostly government

01:36:17
strategies so tactics are situated

01:36:21
tactics as

01:36:23
as

01:36:24
resisting uh let's say broader

01:36:26
structures this again is very much

01:36:28
shaped I'm not saying that everything is

01:36:30
good about it because it's too

01:36:31
dichotomous but it's a very

01:36:33
influential book that has really shaped

01:36:36
much of the debate that form so next

01:36:38
week I'll talk a bit more about let's

01:36:40
say from the everyday to cultural work

01:36:42
and activism a bit more about DIY

01:36:44
urbanism where some of the DIY urbanism

01:36:48
literature for example implicitly or

01:36:50
explicitly refers to the type of stuff

01:36:52
that is adored it already in 1980s

01:36:57
okay

01:36:59
just to conclude

01:37:03
um

01:37:03
as I mentioned the cultural tournament

01:37:05
is to be understood as part of a wider

01:37:08
shift in analytical sensibilities in the

01:37:10
social sciences yeah

01:37:12
I mean at the very beginning I said okay

01:37:13
there's the empirical theoretical and

01:37:16
the methodological these are three takes

01:37:19
on how we are how at that point we

01:37:22
started looking differently at the world

01:37:25
yeah

01:37:26
so urban geography itself as one strand

01:37:30
of debate within this broader cultural

01:37:32
turn uh was and is I would argue heavily

01:37:35
influenced by a Marxist or at least

01:37:37
political economic interpretation of

01:37:40
post-modernism as the cultural

01:37:42
expression of late capitalism yeah

01:37:44
you can also phrase it differently

01:37:46
there's very little subtle Nuance

01:37:50
cultural readings of let's say symbolic

01:37:53
objects such as the Arts in urban

01:37:55
geography for that mostly you have to

01:37:57
move outside of geography because it

01:37:59
does not have this history of taking

01:38:02
subtly about let's say cultural

01:38:03
expressions yeah which doesn't mean it's

01:38:06
not good but it's limited in that

01:38:07
respect the work and symbol of economy

01:38:10
in a way Builds on this but it has

01:38:12
shifted the tension a bit more to

01:38:14
questions of representation uh to urban

01:38:16
lifestyles and cultural production yeah

01:38:18
so the post-modern urbanism school was

01:38:21
wasn't interested that much in artists

01:38:24
producing actual pieces of work actual

01:38:27
art that was most interested in

01:38:29
consumption yeah so the commodity a

01:38:31
study said yeah you buy something with

01:38:32
which you identify as a lifestyle

01:38:34
question

01:38:35
and this is the last part that I discuss

01:38:38
we see an increasing or we saw an

01:38:40
increasing more in a sort of meeting in

01:38:43
a halfway between urban geography

01:38:45
cultural studies and anthropology as

01:38:47
part of a broader spatial term so this

01:38:49
is the funniest thing the interesting

01:38:51
thing is that this cultural turn often

01:38:53
also until the spatial turn yeah it came

01:38:55
it must emerge together in many ways

01:38:59
last point that I discuss is the

01:39:01
research and informality in everyday

01:39:02
life and related concerns as enormously

01:39:05
contributed to a development of a truly

01:39:07
interdisciplinary transdisciplinary form

01:39:09
of cultural Urban studies I think these

01:39:11
are some of the some you see this

01:39:13
happening in in the social science in

01:39:15
the United States at large is that

01:39:16
certain Concepts just resonate with

01:39:19
research is coming from very different

01:39:20
traditions and they become let's say

01:39:22
bridging Concepts that bring together

01:39:24
very different ways of thinking very

01:39:27
different histories of writing and this

01:39:29
is where uh most of them well the most

01:39:31
exciting stuff happens I would argue

01:39:34
okay next week uh this is what I will

01:39:37
try to discuss

01:39:38
um so today my main claim is history

01:39:42
matters so the history of urban studies

01:39:44
that I just discussed shapes also

01:39:46
current research debates on Urban

01:39:47
cultures and the four strands I will try

01:39:50
to discuss with you next week uh

01:39:52
certainly so it is more but I do think

01:39:54
that this is a pretty exhaustive at the

01:39:57
same time are one on the Arts activism

01:40:00
and urban engagement

01:40:02
this wants to add the second one

01:40:04
specifically focusing on cultural

01:40:06
infrastructures and informal urbanism

01:40:08
probably a bit more on the cultural

01:40:10
infrastructure site in the informal side

01:40:11
a third one on Urban tourism and

01:40:14
consumption cultures

01:40:15
and a fourth one

01:40:17
which links most closely to the

01:40:20
methodological concerns perhaps it also

01:40:22
is empirical at the same time

01:40:23
focusing on sensory urbanism so

01:40:25
different kinds of let's say engaging

01:40:27
with the urban beyond the visual and and

01:40:30
text uh again there's only so much I can

01:40:33
do in the two hours that I have next

01:40:35
week but hopefully this gives you a

01:40:36
pretty good overview of what

01:40:39
um cultures of urban research and urban

01:40:41
cultures can be about okay I'll leave it

01:40:44
there and I'm very fast for today any

01:40:46
questions

01:40:47
no everyone happy to go home at quarter

01:40:50
to seven on a Monday evening then I will

01:40:52
see you next week if I don't see you

01:40:54
before

# 7 Urban cultures

00:00:03
I'll start recording immediately because

00:00:05
I forgot to start recording for the

00:00:07
lecture of Claire at least for part of

00:00:09
it let me see here

00:00:58
all right can everyone hear me

00:01:02
yeah I see shaking ass that's good

00:01:04
I now also open to chats I finally found

00:01:07
out how to deal with the chat while

00:01:09
being in a formal uh presenting mode

00:01:13
um I think it's about time to start

00:01:16
um welcome to the second lecture for

00:01:19
um Urban social geography where I'll be

00:01:21
spend in the next two hours uh let's see

00:01:24
if yeah how how much time we need

00:01:28
um for election Urban cultures so um as

00:01:31
you remember in the last session I

00:01:33
largely gave a historical overview of

00:01:35
what I consider to be essential let's

00:01:37
say core coordinates of thinking about

00:01:40
culture in urban geography and more

00:01:43
widely some other let's say related

00:01:45
disciplines starting with a brief

00:01:47
discussion well but it's a relatively

00:01:49
specific discussion on Frederick Jameson

00:01:51
and his notion of post-modernism moving

00:01:54
to the shift of moving to let's say the

00:01:57
1980s early 1990s debate on um

00:02:01
post-modern urbanism and the LA School

00:02:03
of urbanism and then shifting to a to a

00:02:06
wider or but also related debate on the

00:02:08
symbolic economy those were the key

00:02:10
coordinates that I tried to to get

00:02:13
across one of the questions well you

00:02:16
can't see the slides can can everyone

00:02:18
see the slides oh that's odd thank you

00:02:21
for asking the question because I'm

00:02:23
actually screen sharing now

00:02:26
um let me just see I'll just

00:02:29
stop share you should be able to see the

00:02:32
slides

00:02:33
another sec

00:02:35
um

00:02:37
share screen

00:02:40
I'll do it like this done simply this

00:02:43
just a sec

00:02:46
okay you now see my screen

00:02:51
except that I can't see you now just a

00:02:53
sec

00:02:54
this is odds uh one here we are

00:03:03
yeah never see the slides now

00:03:05
I see you one yes thank you so I hope

00:03:07
that's okay perfect okay yes okay thanks

00:03:11
a lot yeah feel free to unmute sometimes

00:03:13
that's easier than uh than working with

00:03:15
uh sign language

00:03:18
um the only thing is I can't see you now

00:03:19
let me see

00:03:22
um where is that

00:03:24
just want to say ah here we are okay now

00:03:27
I see you and hopefully you see me and

00:03:28
we see the slides you did hear what I

00:03:30
was saying right so okay let's let's

00:03:32
keep it from there

00:03:34
um so what I try to get across last week

00:03:36
is what I just discussed I tried to give

00:03:38
an historical overview of some of the

00:03:40
core elements that I thought I think

00:03:41
were are important thinking about Urban

00:03:43
culture over the last 30 40 years

00:03:46
actually oh and some people are in the

00:03:48
waiting room

00:03:49
my life is so so easy let me see

00:03:52
[Music]

00:03:54
before you start working here where are

00:03:56
we no no no no

00:03:59
um I'll stop sharing again that will

00:04:01
admit all again

00:04:03
but at some point it becomes a bit

00:04:04
tricky then people just have to wait for

00:04:06
the last the next uh

00:04:08
the next pause is otherwise it becomes

00:04:10
difficult because with the session of

00:04:12
clear I could actually manage this but

00:04:14
since I don't have an assistant next to

00:04:16
me this is uh what we'll work with Okay

00:04:18
next round we'll we'll go for another

00:04:20
run here we go uh

00:04:24
chat

00:04:27
and start

00:04:31
and now I just need to slip this

00:04:36
do we disadvantage that I don't see you

00:04:38
anymore ah here we are there we are

00:04:42
okay getting there

00:04:44
so for the third time uh I tried to give

00:04:48
an historical overview one of the

00:04:49
questions I received last week is okay

00:04:51
are we going to learn more about actual

00:04:53
cultures so cultural expressions stuff

00:04:55
that interests interests us as 20 20

00:04:58
year olds 20 year olds that's what I

00:05:00
remember so the question to the answer

00:05:02
to that question is yes uh in the

00:05:04
session today I will focus a bit more in

00:05:07
detail on specific well I I will always

00:05:09
focus on research on Urban culture but

00:05:13
look at zooming in more specifically on

00:05:15
Research that looks at actual cultural

00:05:17
expressions but always from the

00:05:19
perspective as to how this has been done

00:05:21
in urban studies there are many other

00:05:23
disciplines of course that focus on

00:05:25
culture or cultural expressions coming

00:05:27
from the humanities in particular

00:05:29
but I will largely zoom in on how this

00:05:31
has been approached within within Urban

00:05:33
studies

00:05:35
um

00:05:35
that will hopefully become clear or

00:05:37
clearer in a minute

00:05:39
before doing so I have I want to broaden

00:05:42
the debate a bit beyond urban geography

00:05:43
per se and and I show some of the slides

00:05:45
and discuss some of the slides that I

00:05:47
also already mentioned uh last uh last

00:05:50
week

00:05:51
because if you look at the way urban

00:05:54
geography has has undergone its own

00:05:56
cultural turn as I'm as I hinted at last

00:05:59
week what we saw happening in in

00:06:01
parallel is that many other disciplines

00:06:03
within the social science the humanities

00:06:04
have also undergone a kind of spatial

00:06:06
turn so we've seen a kind of meeting

00:06:08
halfway a kind of rakash more between

00:06:11
geography becoming a more cultural

00:06:13
discipline but other disciplines also

00:06:15
becoming more cultural becoming more

00:06:16
geographical becoming more spatial

00:06:21
um so this cultural this spatial turn

00:06:23
had a number of reasons as I already

00:06:25
mentioned I think last week one of them

00:06:27
being a post 1989 obsession with

00:06:30
globalization so the moment you start

00:06:32
thinking seriously about globalization

00:06:33
you quasi-automatically start thinking

00:06:35
about spatial issues about geographical

00:06:38
issues because what if it's here but

00:06:40
also somewhere else you start thinking

00:06:42
about Connections

00:06:43
the other one being a kind of critique

00:06:45
of modernity which had really shaped I

00:06:47
think most of the social science and

00:06:48
Humanities debates up until the 1970s

00:06:51
which primarily sort of uh paid

00:06:54
attention to temporal issues to time

00:06:56
because that's the very logic of

00:06:57
thinking in terms of modernity so what

00:07:00
we've seen over the years since the late

00:07:02
1970s roughly speaking is we see this

00:07:05
kind of de-emphasizing us of temporal

00:07:08
issues and emphasizing

00:07:10
uh of of spatial issues and this is

00:07:13
where the let's see the spatial turn

00:07:15
comes in so this in turn and this is

00:07:17
what I want to briefly focus on for the

00:07:19
opening of this today's session led to

00:07:22
an increased interaction between urban

00:07:23
geography Urban anthropology and

00:07:25
cultural studies many other disciplines

00:07:27
also but for me those are some of the

00:07:29
core disciplines that really

00:07:31
um shaped I think the future of uh of us

00:07:34
the the the the research on Urban

00:07:37
culture at Large

00:07:41
now there are

00:07:46
a number of core teams in urban

00:07:48
anthropology and and or cultural studies

00:07:51
that have shaped the late 20th century

00:07:54
early 21st century trajectory of what I

00:07:56
consider to be let's say

00:07:57
interdisciplinary Urban studies I'm not

00:08:00
going to give a review here of urban

00:08:01
anthropology or cultural studies they're

00:08:03
both fascinating disciplines I learned a

00:08:06
lot from both disciplines

00:08:08
um I mean I was trained in cultural

00:08:10
studies myself before becoming a

00:08:11
geographer you could say

00:08:13
um but there are two let's say teams

00:08:15
that I want to briefly flag here which I

00:08:18
think

00:08:19
um I have a much longer history in in in

00:08:22
anthropology and cultural studies but

00:08:24
have which have really been picked up in

00:08:27
in into this finale Urban studies and

00:08:28
shaped this debate up to the present day

00:08:30
the first debate uh being around what I

00:08:34
label here is informality

00:08:36
it's the kind of debate that that

00:08:37
emerged in anthropology and and

00:08:40
development studies largely focusing on

00:08:43
informal economy labor markets

00:08:45
precarious work migration issues of

00:08:47
workers legality and illegality

00:08:50
distinction but also the regulation so

00:08:51
the political governance of uh of

00:08:54
informality I'll give a few examples in

00:08:56
a minute

00:08:57
the second core team that I think is

00:08:59
important to to keep in mind as a kind

00:09:01
of understanding of the history of

00:09:03
research on Urban culture is research on

00:09:05
everyday life that's a term that is you

00:09:08
don't see the term used that much

00:09:10
anymore I would say in the last 10 years

00:09:12
or so you still see it a lot but then

00:09:14
less so as a theoretical concept but it

00:09:17
was it was a term that was pretty much

00:09:18
dominant almost in dominance in the

00:09:21
1980s 1990s 2000s largely used as a kind

00:09:25
of shorthand or a kind of buzzword for

00:09:27
referring to issues around agency

00:09:29
community community building also

00:09:31
resistance issues as well as consumption

00:09:34
and identity questions and related

00:09:36
representational questions which then in

00:09:38
turn uh had an often a lot to do with

00:09:40
how things were represented in in media

00:09:42
so everyday life

00:09:44
refers to many things just as

00:09:46
informality refers to many things but if

00:09:48
you would have to give a kind of

00:09:49
nutshell summary this slide pretty much

00:09:51
covers it I think

00:09:55
now briefly if you think about

00:09:56
informality within biology Urban

00:10:00
anthropology and development studies

00:10:01
it's a term that is last was less use in

00:10:04
in cultural studies it's a classic team

00:10:07
especially from the early 1970s onwards

00:10:09
the the core reference and perhaps uh

00:10:12
the the first person who coined the idea

00:10:14
of the informal economy that many others

00:10:17
of course who did research on the

00:10:18
informal economy without labeling it as

00:10:20
such was key to heart and one of the

00:10:23
classic articles or one of the first

00:10:25
articles there is this article from 1973

00:10:27
which is titled informal income

00:10:30
opportunities and urban employment in

00:10:31
Ghana now the article is actually case

00:10:34
study as such is less relevant than

00:10:37
um than the understanding as to what he

00:10:39
coined in this article how this is

00:10:41
shaped let's say subsequent debates so

00:10:44
heart primarily focused on a number of

00:10:46
things you focused on actual employment

00:10:49
so people making a living beyond

00:10:51
government jobs Beyond factories and

00:10:54
Beyond large-scale companies yeah I said

00:10:56
okay there's a whole world out there of

00:10:58
how people make a living especially in

00:11:00
Ghana but he then sort of extrapolated

00:11:02
this through Urban Africa at large say

00:11:04
okay there's a whole world out there of

00:11:06
work that we actually don't see we don't

00:11:09
capture it we don't matter we don't see

00:11:11
it because we don't have the vocabulary

00:11:13
to really pay attention to it

00:11:15
so that's that's the first observation

00:11:17
he makes there yeah that makes it uh he

00:11:20
bases this on a distinction between

00:11:21
informal and formally where he says well

00:11:23
all the vocabulary that we have is

00:11:26
largely catering to especially from

00:11:28
economics to capturing registering and

00:11:30
registering and measuring uh formal

00:11:32
labor so labor that actually shows up in

00:11:35
in GDP uh values Etc yeah labor that is

00:11:38
actually taxed and a lot of the labor

00:11:41
that we see in urban Africa you argued

00:11:43
is not taxed as such or we don't see it

00:11:45
for that reason

00:11:47
so he introduced the distinction

00:11:49
informal labor formal economy formal

00:11:51
employment and informal employment

00:11:55
he also then makes a distinction between

00:11:56
illegitimate and legitimate labor where

00:11:58
he said okay legitimate activity which

00:12:01
is not the same as informal and formal

00:12:02
he says okay we can have informal

00:12:05
activity according to him so economic

00:12:08
activity which is not measured as such

00:12:10
which is still legitimate which he then

00:12:12
argues those are activities that do

00:12:14
actually make a contribution to economic

00:12:17
growth but at a small scale so if you

00:12:20
let's say uh sell uh uh Foods on on a

00:12:24
local market but this is not this is not

00:12:26
captured you're not registered as an

00:12:28
official business this according to them

00:12:30
is legitimate in for a legitimate

00:12:32
informal activity which I think most of

00:12:34
us can actually agree with and then

00:12:37
there's illegitimate informal activity

00:12:39
where he says well that can refer to

00:12:41
criminal activities but also for example

00:12:43
to bagging or bribery or corruption

00:12:46
which he considers to be a illegitimate

00:12:49
so there's a kind of fourfold

00:12:51
Distinction which is uh which has really

00:12:53
shaped the thing to debate and you can

00:12:55
question and disagree with some of the

00:12:56
species of his arguments but the way he

00:12:59
structured this idea has uh has been

00:13:01
quite important

00:13:03
now I mentioned this here not because I

00:13:04
want to discuss with you Urban Africa or

00:13:06
1973 Keith Hart but because I think some

00:13:10
of the the let's see the landmark

00:13:11
studies that he and others have done in

00:13:13
the early 1970s have informed the

00:13:16
debates that followed elsewhere

00:13:18
informality is an interesting concept

00:13:20
because it's one of the few Concepts You

00:13:21
could argue that has really seen a

00:13:24
concept travel from the global styles to

00:13:25
the global North so where most of us are

00:13:28
very well aware of critiques to what

00:13:30
let's say Urban studies saying well it's

00:13:31
actually eurocentric or at least Western

00:13:33
Centric informality is one of those

00:13:35
Concepts which you could say started in

00:13:38
the global South and actually has been

00:13:40
picked up increasingly in order to

00:13:41
understand also practices within the

00:13:43
global North to such an extent I would

00:13:45
argue that as one of the few Concepts

00:13:47
which really transcends this kind of

00:13:49
global style Global nor divides and

00:13:51
really sort of contributes to thinking

00:13:53
in terms of a global Urban studies so if

00:13:55
you look at work for example of of

00:13:57
ananya Roy or Jennifer Roberson they've

00:13:59
picked up on the on the informality

00:14:01
topic as a way of also thinking about

00:14:04
Urban studies in more Global terms

00:14:06
without being being let's say

00:14:07
eurocentric or Western Centric

00:14:10
um there are all kinds of related terms

00:14:12
and they all have to do let's say this

00:14:13
disciplinary specifics that are pretty

00:14:17
much try to cover the same field but I

00:14:19
won't discuss here such as unregistered

00:14:20
economy Black Market the non-observed

00:14:23
economy Undeclared work or the Shadow or

00:14:25
hidden economy and for those that say

00:14:28
more trained and feminist Theory it's

00:14:30
quite obvious let's say that the

00:14:31
distinction between informal and formal

00:14:33
but actually also maps on to the

00:14:36
distinction between public and private

00:14:38
with public with public activities often

00:14:41
being seen as part of the former economy

00:14:42
but let's say private activities such as

00:14:44
care work being seen as the informal

00:14:46
economy often also not measured and thus

00:14:49
supposedly not worthy of attention yeah

00:14:52
and of course this is as overlapped and

00:14:55
and been involved in rethinking the

00:14:57
terms of that debate to an important

00:14:58
extent also

00:15:02
so on Urban anthropology when thinking

00:15:04
about informality you get the research

00:15:06
on the opportunities but also precarious

00:15:08
created by unregulated economic

00:15:10
activities uh I will give some examples

00:15:12
later but it's quite obvious for example

00:15:14
if we fast forward let's say to research

00:15:16
on creative and cultural Industries and

00:15:18
research that is now being done on

00:15:20
precarious uh precarious uh artistic

00:15:22
labor for example it's it's it struggles

00:15:25
with a similar attention where to a

00:15:27
large extent artistic labor is also

00:15:29
unregulated which creates all kinds of

00:15:31
freedoms and opportunities but is at the

00:15:33
same time this let's say this

00:15:34
unregulated nature which makes it very

00:15:37
precarious because there's no way you

00:15:38
can actually support or let's say where

00:15:41
a state or a welfare state of other

00:15:42
mechanisms can actually structure the

00:15:45
kind of economic activities

00:15:47
Urban anthropology historically speaking

00:15:49
has also seen a strong interest in the

00:15:51
gender dimensions of informal works I've

00:15:54
already hinted at this partially in the

00:15:56
home situation partially mostly females

00:15:59
being women working on markets Etc so

00:16:02
all kinds of uh gendered in exclusions

00:16:04
that are part of this discussion and

00:16:06
again these have shaped debates in the

00:16:08
in the decades that followed

00:16:11
also important things that Urban

00:16:13
anthropology we see informality being

00:16:15
linked strongly to transnational

00:16:17
Dimensions yeah so with the idea that

00:16:19
informal uh labor market in formal Urban

00:16:22
labor markets are often also highly

00:16:24
transnational labor markets on one level

00:16:27
with

00:16:28
diaspora connections people sending back

00:16:30
their their their earnings or part of

00:16:32
their earnings to their home country but

00:16:34
also with many migrants actually

00:16:36
occupying in former labor markets in in

00:16:38
country in cities across the world so

00:16:40
there's a kind of transnational

00:16:41
connection which urban anthropology

00:16:43
certainly was among the first uh to pay

00:16:45
uh to pay attention to oh which has seen

00:16:48
an increasing amount of research in in

00:16:50
urban and interdisciplinary Urban

00:16:52
studies

00:16:54
to use an example of the mandir was in

00:16:57
Barcelona for example who often have an

00:16:58
African background uh and who have who

00:17:01
live in relatively precarious situations

00:17:03
well very precarious situation in Spain

00:17:05
being sort of legal illegal semi-legal

00:17:07
in different different kinds of statuses

00:17:09
and trying to make a living uh in in

00:17:12
this case Barcelona

00:17:18
so that's a five minute summary of a 40

00:17:20
40-year debate in urban anthropology so

00:17:23
apologies for any sort of uh lack of

00:17:25
selfies but my discussion is relatively

00:17:27
instrumental here and that I want to get

00:17:29
across some of the key uh let's say

00:17:32
conceptual elements uh conceptual

00:17:35
nuggets you could say that that should

00:17:37
also shape debate and interdisciplinary

00:17:39
Urban studies a second term that that

00:17:42
I'm sure you've come across before in in

00:17:44
your reading is everyday life

00:17:48
now but wasn't anthropology but

00:17:50
especially I think in cultural studies

00:17:52
this notion of everyday life really

00:17:54
shaped the debate and and and signifies

00:17:57
in many ways a concern with the lift

00:17:59
experiences and meanings constructed by

00:18:01
subjects in their own worlds

00:18:03
um partially emerging you could save in

00:18:06
in the 1970s as a chronic critique of

00:18:09
supposedly structuralist Marxist theory

00:18:11
paying more attention to agency so it's

00:18:13
part of that 1970s 1980s debate but then

00:18:16
also um

00:18:17
increasingly moving into a let's say

00:18:20
substantive Empirical research

00:18:22
where uh where research started paying

00:18:23
attention to the actual lift experiences

00:18:25
and the meanings of of people yeah so

00:18:29
people as active creative agents rather

00:18:31
than as passive consumers uh this is

00:18:33
kind of what the the broad

00:18:35
interdisciplinary sprawling debate of

00:18:37
everyday life uh signifies

00:18:41
now there are many

00:18:42
I think within different supplies that

00:18:44
have in one way or another try to engage

00:18:46
with everyday life with or without using

00:18:48
the concept one which I will only hint

00:18:50
at I think here but which might be

00:18:53
discussed in some more detail by those

00:18:55
that follow not I know what not everyone

00:18:57
does but depending on your program those

00:18:59
that follow Urban sociology of Ava

00:19:01
swimkidao there's a kind of tradition of

00:19:04
community studies and anthropology and

00:19:05
cultural studies which historically has

00:19:07
focused on participant observation and

00:19:09
extensive periods of field work to

00:19:11
really gain trust and insight knowledge

00:19:12
of everyday practices so basically an

00:19:15
anthropological stance you could say you

00:19:16
become part of a community and only

00:19:19
through this inside knowledge you will

00:19:21
actually understand the meanings and and

00:19:23
interpretations attached to certain

00:19:25
practices

00:19:26
it of course also has a history going

00:19:28
back to the Chicago school with research

00:19:30
on also ethnographic research on on

00:19:33
urban areas and various let's say Urban

00:19:35
topics such as gangs ethnic segregation

00:19:37
lifestyle delinquency

00:19:39
but there's also a rural connection

00:19:41
whereas especially within our sociology

00:19:44
let's say partially in parallel to the

00:19:46
Chicago school which was always more

00:19:48
urban in its orientation where some

00:19:50
classic Community studies especially in

00:19:52
the 1950s and 1960s

00:19:55
um sort of started applying you could

00:19:56
say rural concepts of classic Community

00:19:58
studies to Urban settings so look going

00:20:01
into a supposed community in an urban

00:20:03
setting and then focusing on let's say

00:20:05
family and kinship relations or

00:20:07
traditions and rituals yeah this kind of

00:20:10
community studies literature has been

00:20:12
quite heavily criticized over the years

00:20:14
largely for being too localists or for

00:20:17
assuming Community as relatively

00:20:19
homogeneous which was already

00:20:21
problematic you would say in a in a

00:20:24
rural setting but certainly you is

00:20:26
problematic in a much more dynamic

00:20:27
dynamic Urban setting so this idea that

00:20:30
communities actually share same values

00:20:32
was increasingly questioned but the

00:20:35
tradition there of let's say focusing on

00:20:37
everyday life of these communities uh

00:20:40
was already was established by this kind

00:20:42
of uh this kind of literature

00:20:45
excuse me uh there's somebody waiting on

00:20:48
their waiting room let's see because

00:20:50
every time when I have to well I might

00:20:52
be able to do it like this

00:20:55
nope where are we

00:20:58
participants here we are okay four more

00:21:02
because I can't do this all the time

00:21:04
because it's quite interrupting so but

00:21:05
I'll now I'll start again

00:21:08
okay you can still see me

00:21:11
perfect now we'll continue

00:21:14
um

00:21:15
so especially from the 1980s onwards I

00:21:18
think we've seen a Revival of the of the

00:21:20
community studies uh that moved beyond

00:21:22
the kind of nostalgic notion of

00:21:23
community and this is where sort of

00:21:25
again the everyday life uh Notions uh

00:21:29
um well returns in a way or becomes more

00:21:32
present in in in in theorizing uh urban

00:21:36
communities

00:21:37
some basic Trends and again I just

00:21:39
mentioned them here but I think they

00:21:41
basically still structure the debate up

00:21:43
to this day is that artists started

00:21:46
using conflict theoretical approaches

00:21:47
instead of cohesion theoretical

00:21:49
approaches so looking at

00:21:51
let's say interactions obviously social

00:21:53
interactions between uh actors between

00:21:56
people but also not sort of assuming

00:21:59
let's say cohesion theoretically but

00:22:01
assuming that's the conflict

00:22:03
theoretically you could say very bluntly

00:22:06
speaking you could say instead moving

00:22:07
from a dual Crimean perspective to a

00:22:09
Marxist perspective that's very

00:22:11
simplistic but basically that's is what

00:22:13
covers to a certain extent the debates

00:22:16
also focus on network ties local and

00:22:18
trans local I already mentioned this

00:22:20
with Urban anthropology

00:22:21
uh care and support and unequal and

00:22:24
changing our settings and because of the

00:22:26
let's say the interest in let's say

00:22:28
conflicts and how communities are

00:22:30
constructed not how they I say are

00:22:32
assumed to be there was increasing

00:22:34
interest to let's see the shifting

00:22:36
symbolic boundaries between communities

00:22:37
so the sort of the the making connection

00:22:40
but also making distinctions between uh

00:22:43
between communities and between groups

00:22:45
and that of course then opens up let's

00:22:47
say the base to not just communities as

00:22:49
let's say an aprily facts of social life

00:22:52
but more into debates around communities

00:22:55
of choice and elective belonging so they

00:22:57
can move into subcultures or lgbtqi

00:22:59
communities but also gated communities

00:23:01
for example in urban settings where

00:23:03
people choose to belong to a very

00:23:06
separate community

00:23:10
now the everyday is really a striking uh

00:23:13
coincidence let's say the career of this

00:23:15
concept because it's a truly

00:23:16
transdisciplinary concept perhaps even

00:23:18
more so than uh than the informal or

00:23:21
informality truly transdisciplinary

00:23:23
maybe with a strong Humanity background

00:23:25
but really connecting cultural Theory

00:23:27
with philosophy with Marxism with

00:23:29
ethnography with more structuralism with

00:23:31
sociology and with Aesthetics and that's

00:23:33
that's precisely what makes this concept

00:23:35
I think so interesting or so influential

00:23:37
for research on Urban cultures now you

00:23:40
have to be careful here because the

00:23:42
simple fact that a concept is used and

00:23:44
all these different let's say Traditions

00:23:46
or disciplines doesn't mean of course

00:23:48
that is used in the same way so if you

00:23:50
look for example that's and there's no

00:23:52
no time to discuss this here but if you

00:23:54
look for example that everyday life in

00:23:56
in let's say ethnography it's quite

00:23:58
different than everyday life and

00:24:00
Aesthetics and quite different than

00:24:02
everyday life let's say in more post

00:24:04
post-structural literary Theory yeah

00:24:07
um so you have to be quite careful there

00:24:09
but for every studies I would argue

00:24:11
there are a number of approaches which

00:24:13
have really let's say let's see Eternal

00:24:15
references in a way those those artists

00:24:17
that are continually continuously

00:24:18
referenced one is the unavoidable Humvee

00:24:21
Lafayette

00:24:22
everyone references hallway Lafayette

00:24:24
who sees the everyday as a side of

00:24:27
utopian possibility but in in line with

00:24:30
let's say it's Marx's credentials also

00:24:32
sees the everyday as colonized by the

00:24:34
commodity form so a commodification

00:24:36
logic also shaping the everyday that has

00:24:40
been of course Very differential thing

00:24:42
in in in our studies to a large extent

00:24:44
also because it it's pretty compatible

00:24:47
with the kind of critical political

00:24:49
economic Urban studies approach so

00:24:51
people can claim or can become more

00:24:53
interested in culture but don't actually

00:24:55
don't have to leave let's say the house

00:24:56
of political economy too far they can

00:24:58
stay pretty close to that kind of debate

00:25:01
but I would ask you to also pay

00:25:02
attention to other more let's say

00:25:04
perhaps empirically minded research that

00:25:06
was still very theoretical and I can I

00:25:08
will only mention two here which which

00:25:10
have been equally at least influential I

00:25:12
think in in urban studies one being uh

00:25:15
worked by Stuart Hall

00:25:18
um who is a massive towering figure I

00:25:21
think within cultural studies British

00:25:23
cultural studies at least

00:25:25
um who looks at let's say the everyday

00:25:27
life Elijah tour you could say

00:25:28
especially in this book here which is an

00:25:30
additive book and a compilation of let's

00:25:32
see classic uh papers of the British

00:25:34
cultural studies

00:25:37
Center at that point in time uh to the

00:25:40
looks at it to the subcultural lands and

00:25:43
the notion of subculture was coined by

00:25:45
British cultural studies and even though

00:25:47
subculture is also where we tend not to

00:25:49
use anymore many of the let's say

00:25:52
practices that we assumed to uh to shape

00:25:56
subcultures are with us today so we

00:25:58
might not name them subcultures anymore

00:26:00
we might talk about them it seems or

00:26:02
about the networks or something along

00:26:04
those lines but the idea that

00:26:06
subcultures are let's say every day but

00:26:10
also are also kind of symbolic

00:26:11
opposition to a dominant social order

00:26:13
this idea that they're in one way or

00:26:15
another resistance uh is is very

00:26:18
influential I think so if you look at

00:26:20
the literature on let's say subcultures

00:26:22
or let's say neural literature on on

00:26:24
protest movements or let's say clubbing

00:26:26
culture it's it's it still uses these

00:26:29
kinds of this kind of vocabulary

00:26:31
so that then directs attention allows

00:26:34
you to Urban practices of resistance but

00:26:37
also style of fashion of social

00:26:39
practices or the particular codes that

00:26:41
are used within within a community and

00:26:44
interacts attention I think also to a

00:26:45
particular let's say generational

00:26:47
category namely Urban Youth

00:26:50
um which I think was really has always

00:26:52
been a researched in a way but British

00:26:53
cultural studies tradition as as perhaps

00:26:56
directed most of his attention to let's

00:26:58
see this particular category uh of this

00:27:01
particular generational layer

00:27:06
typical however also for British

00:27:08
cultural studies at that point in time

00:27:11
is a certain gender blindness if you

00:27:14
look at let's say the early cultural

00:27:15
studies tradition uh those that did

00:27:18
research on subcultures by and large

00:27:19
looked at new sculptures as you could

00:27:21
say boyish masculine use cultures yeah

00:27:24
so there's certainly a certain gender

00:27:27
blindness in the kind of resistant youth

00:27:29
cultural literature

00:27:31
however this has increasingly been

00:27:32
addressed in subsequent work partially

00:27:35
this kind of Club cultures literature

00:27:37
that I mentioned also by the work of

00:27:39
artists such as Angela mcrobbie who was

00:27:41
part of the early British cultural

00:27:42
studies tradition is now a professor at

00:27:44
the goldsmiths college and it was really

00:27:47
addressed this kind of literature this

00:27:49
kind of gender dimension of uh of

00:27:52
cultural studies

00:27:55
another order and this is certainly a

00:27:57
book I can well the other book also but

00:27:59
I can certainly um recommend you to read

00:28:01
this book if only because it's a very

00:28:03
pleasant read it's beautifully written

00:28:05
and it's not a thick book I think it has

00:28:07
around 200 Pages Max I think it's pretty

00:28:09
uh pretty readable

00:28:12
uh and his and then he's written many

00:28:15
things on everyday life but this is

00:28:16
perhaps the most heavily cited book the

00:28:18
practice of everyday life from 1984 the

00:28:22
having said the term that the English

00:28:23
translations from 1984 if I'm not

00:28:26
mistaken it might be later that the

00:28:28
original French day is actually from

00:28:30
that time I I will need to look it up I

00:28:32
forgot

00:28:33
is beautifully written it's perhaps more

00:28:35
poetic I would say and less political

00:28:37
than British cultural studies or at

00:28:40
least Less in your face political uh but

00:28:43
it has a vocabulary I think that is um

00:28:46
uh has been very influential

00:28:49
um according to the Sato where Society

00:28:52
is is largely shaped and I think the by

00:28:54
the binary nature of it the way he

00:28:56
phrase it has been has been criticized

00:28:57
but still the the

00:29:00
um it has been very influential but

00:29:02
according to this the society's largely

00:29:04
shaped by tactics versus strategies or

00:29:07
strategies versus tactics in that order

00:29:09
perhaps with a kind of states

00:29:12
by and large he's French right so to see

00:29:14
who puts the states very Central perhaps

00:29:15
even more so than the economy

00:29:18
um devises all kinds of let's say

00:29:19
strategies structures orders of social

00:29:21
life against which uh we as Citizens as

00:29:26
as groups although it has a relatively

00:29:28
individual Focus device all kinds of

00:29:31
tactics in order to resist to to avoid

00:29:34
to intervene

00:29:37
um so all kinds of creative ways of of

00:29:39
dealing with dealing with strategies and

00:29:41
sort of turning it around and doing

00:29:43
something else with it this is the kind

00:29:45
of literature right that which as I said

00:29:47
the binary nature of it that this idea

00:29:49
that there is such a thing as strategies

00:29:51
let's say top-down strategies versus

00:29:53
bottom-up tactics because that's the

00:29:55
kind of image you see is problematic

00:29:57
it's too simplistic I think but it has

00:30:00
very much shaped this idea that we have

00:30:02
let's say uh media cultures shaping uh

00:30:07
shaping things but we are also creative

00:30:09
consumers we can actually change and

00:30:11
creatively interpret things yeah

00:30:13
gives a very Urban angle to this it

00:30:17
really talks a lot about let's say

00:30:19
walking in the city for example some of

00:30:21
the walking literature and walking

00:30:23
um there's a door is one of the key

00:30:25
artists there and it really looks at

00:30:26
okay obviously there's a city which has

00:30:28
been designed and structured and

00:30:29
constructed in a certain way but we as

00:30:32
soon as we can walk in the city and sort

00:30:34
of adapt and use a different line route

00:30:37
of walking Etc and in ways not intended

00:30:40
by the designers

00:30:41
so it doesn't lead to a kind of

00:30:43
literature any kind of reading reading

00:30:45
which looks at tactics everyday

00:30:47
practices I would say the practice of

00:30:49
everyday life as situated it's often

00:30:51
very local sometimes as defensive in in

00:30:54
defense uh yeah in defense too but also

00:30:58
sometimes opportunistic you sort of pick

00:31:00
up on some structured elements and do

00:31:02
something else with it so that's the

00:31:04
kind of literature and especially kind

00:31:06
of vocabulary which again has shaped a

00:31:08
lot of things this idea of of of

00:31:10
achieved a lot of research uh on on

00:31:13
Urban sorry on everyday life

00:31:17
okay

00:31:19
that's my first part I will I'm just

00:31:22
going to quick look but I see no one

00:31:23
entering anymore because now I have

00:31:25
pretty much all

00:31:26
chat box not a box is open

00:31:29
um are there any questions on this first

00:31:31
part as a kind of

00:31:34
uh first corner I see a question from

00:31:37
Vera as James Scott can you maybe

00:31:39
explain this very critical brief

00:31:42
question

00:31:45
I don't see you so you're gonna have to

00:31:47
sort of speak up now I was just thinking

00:31:50
about the the work of uh the the circle

00:31:54
Michelle that you mentioned yeah and

00:31:58
actually also James Carter is from the

00:32:00
the same period he published the the

00:32:03
everyday life experience of the pleasant

00:32:06
Etc yeah and he spoke about this uh

00:32:08
infrapolitics and Mathis stuff

00:32:11
absolutely no it's it's very much part

00:32:13
of the state the same reasoning so one

00:32:15
of the other books that I could have

00:32:17
mentioned deep raps but it has been less

00:32:18
influential in in urban studies but

00:32:21
there's a great book by by James Scott

00:32:23
also seeing like a state

00:32:25
which is basically this this kind of

00:32:28
logic it's the kind of see like States

00:32:30
you could replace that with the with the

00:32:33
dosato vocabulary of strategies and then

00:32:37
you have citizens people communities

00:32:40
these profitable community oriented

00:32:41
they're partially shaped I think by his

00:32:43
anthropological backgrounds which is

00:32:45
which devise all kinds of tactics as

00:32:48
ways of resistance no absolutely it's

00:32:49
it's that kind of that kind of debate

00:32:52
yeah good question

00:32:55
any other questions on this first point

00:32:57
if so just speak up because that's easy

00:33:00
for me than go through the whole list of

00:33:02
people

00:33:06
no

00:33:08
okay

00:33:10
then I'll continue with the second Parts

00:33:12
well yeah indeed

00:33:14
so a couple of lines of research that

00:33:17
are let's say more contemporary so

00:33:19
current lines of research within Urban

00:33:21
studies that focus on Urban culture

00:33:24
with an interdisciplinary over studies I

00:33:26
think here we definitely move beyond the

00:33:28
realm of urban geography narrowly

00:33:30
defined and I want to discuss with you

00:33:32
today

00:33:35
um

00:33:35
the reason why I spend a fair amount of

00:33:37
attention to the previous argument to

00:33:39
the previous debate is also because as

00:33:40
you will see in the discussion that now

00:33:43
follows is that the kind of vocabulary

00:33:45
that these kinds of debates use are very

00:33:47
still influenced knowingly or

00:33:49
unknowingly unknowingly so by the

00:33:52
previous discussions so by both issues

00:33:55
on the symbolic economy postmodern

00:33:56
urbanism informality in everyday life so

00:33:59
that really still shapes I think some of

00:34:01
these current debates

00:34:03
I will now discuss all possible

00:34:05
directions uh in in interdisciplinary

00:34:08
over studies on Urban culture if only

00:34:10
because culture is such a let's say

00:34:13
a slippery concept and and research has

00:34:15
to really explode in all kinds of

00:34:17
directions and as led to all kinds we

00:34:19
could say sub-disciplines uh or or let's

00:34:22
say certain strands of research that

00:34:24
that would be impossible to do uh in uh

00:34:27
in a two-hour uh lecture so I've been

00:34:30
quite let's say uh selective the

00:34:33
selection has been purely based on my

00:34:34
own preferences in a sense that I'm

00:34:36
going to discuss with you the number of

00:34:38
strands of research that I consider to

00:34:40
be interesting or the most interesting

00:34:41
strands of research obviously I also

00:34:44
consider to be this the more to be the

00:34:46
more productive strands of research and

00:34:48
a lot of research is being done in this

00:34:50
uh in this kind of field

00:34:52
the first round of research I want to

00:34:54
discuss with you and again I'll pause at

00:34:56
the end of this trend is around the Arts

00:34:58
activism and urban engagement

00:35:01
um

00:35:02
research on the Arts of course there is

00:35:04
an established tradition obviously

00:35:06
primarily in the humanities of aesthetic

00:35:08
analysis of the Arts yeah so of painting

00:35:11
of music of theater mostly actually as

00:35:14
an increasingly so diverse uh

00:35:17
differentiating into different

00:35:19
disciplines so we'll have musicology you

00:35:21
will have tiered studies you will have

00:35:23
let's see art history or visual studies

00:35:25
and those are established editions

00:35:28
afterwards histories reaching back 100

00:35:30
years yeah

00:35:32
Urban studies and even as an

00:35:34
interdisciplinary field Builds on these

00:35:36
Traditions but actually it's primarily

00:35:39
uses a sociological and or political

00:35:41
economic approach towards the arts and

00:35:43
culture so some of the elements I will

00:35:45
discuss here they certainly do not

00:35:47
capture the diversity offer let's say

00:35:49
research on the Arts that is out there

00:35:50
yeah but um they do pretty much capture

00:35:53
I think what's out there within within

00:35:55
nervous studies

00:35:58
social scientific approach towards the

00:36:01
Arts obviously shapes the kinds of

00:36:03
questions being asked so one the result

00:36:06
of this is that we also see through the

00:36:09
let's say the critical focus on let's

00:36:10
say the political economy of the Arts we

00:36:13
also see it about in many or with many

00:36:16
orders and many in many Publications and

00:36:18
interest in the political or critical

00:36:20
potential and practice of the Arts yeah

00:36:23
this is partially also a response to

00:36:26
um and that's something I will not

00:36:28
discuss in detail here to a relatively

00:36:30
dominant debate on the creative and

00:36:32
cultural Industries which has really

00:36:33
shaped I think the debate on the Arts uh

00:36:37
in the last 20 years this idea that

00:36:39
creative and cultural Industries

00:36:40
contribute to to let's see our

00:36:43
contemporary knowledge economy that

00:36:45
there are key economic sectors in in our

00:36:47
in our current cities and thus with a

00:36:49
strong focus on economic dimensions of

00:36:51
culture

00:36:52
is interesting you could say the

00:36:54
political potential uh the critical

00:36:55
potential of the Arts is also partially

00:36:57
irresponsiveness there are longer

00:36:59
Traditions I will discuss some of them

00:37:00
but this is a way of also trying to look

00:37:03
at the creative Industries debate

00:37:04
critically and say okay well actually we

00:37:06
miss out on a lot when we do not address

00:37:08
the let's say the the resistant

00:37:11
dimensions of the Arts

00:37:15
now that dream well there are many of

00:37:17
course but I'm summarize them here as as

00:37:18
three main lines of urban research on

00:37:20
the Arts and I will discuss them uh

00:37:23
briefly in turn one and perhaps the most

00:37:26
established line of research uh also

00:37:28
because it ties in I think with a with a

00:37:31
history of research in the

00:37:33
uh well in in in our Theory basically in

00:37:37
an art history is research on public

00:37:39
arts and or site-specific Arts the terms

00:37:43
overlap

00:37:44
a second line of research is research on

00:37:46
artists and urban social movements the

00:37:48
relation between artistic practice and

00:37:50
urban social movements and of course

00:37:52
with social movements we can establish

00:37:54
debate within Urban studies also

00:37:57
and the third literature is literature

00:37:59
that is perhaps the most cultural

00:38:00
studies oriented literature is

00:38:02
literature on popular culture and urban

00:38:04
politics so it's literature that that's

00:38:06
increasingly

00:38:09
um I say engaged with with let's see

00:38:11
also theoretical and philosophical

00:38:12
literature on the political uh and how

00:38:15
public culture plays a role in relation

00:38:17
to Urban political questions

00:38:20
and I will discuss of course what I mean

00:38:23
with the political here because it's not

00:38:24
institutional politics per se or if at

00:38:26
all

00:38:29
now the first line of research within uh

00:38:32
within this this section

00:38:35
as public art or site-specific art

00:38:39
um for your readings I I added an

00:38:41
admittedly relatively long uh chapter uh

00:38:44
by Rosalind Deutsche a New York theorist

00:38:47
so apologies for the length of the of

00:38:48
the chapter but I I included it because

00:38:51
it's well for two reasons one goes in

00:38:54
Deutsche is a key art theorist a key

00:38:56
cultural theorist who very early on I

00:38:59
think understood the the productive

00:39:02
connections between our Theory and urban

00:39:05
studies or geography critical geography

00:39:07
yeah and who wrote in the 1980s and

00:39:10
1990s a few foundational papers on uh on

00:39:14
the Arts and the urban

00:39:16
the the paper here is called uneven

00:39:18
development public art in New York City

00:39:21
and it basically covers how you could

00:39:23
say a history of dealing with or

00:39:26
engaging with public art in New York

00:39:28
City

00:39:30
um both by let's say local governments

00:39:32
local the real estate developers more or

00:39:34
less in Project developers and uh and

00:39:37
artistic communities

00:39:40
I could have chosen other articles there

00:39:42
are many other articles possible

00:39:44
um in the same book by the way and I

00:39:45
think I included the full book there's

00:39:47
also a great uh critique the feminist

00:39:51
critique of uh of Jameson and Harvey by

00:39:54
the way I think the the the chapters

00:39:56
called men in space if I'm not mistaken

00:39:58
so basically she devises it develops a

00:40:01
feminist ethnographic critique of

00:40:03
Jameson and Harvey so I could definitely

00:40:05
advise you to read this also

00:40:07
um but in this particular paper she

00:40:10
basically

00:40:11
develops a critique of the

00:40:13
instrumentalization of public art so an

00:40:15
emotion of the public by local

00:40:16
governments and developers so this idea

00:40:18
that public Arts the way is presented or

00:40:21
used by local governments and developers

00:40:23
let's say for those working more on

00:40:25
planning in many countries you will have

00:40:27
if you have a kind of building scheme or

00:40:29
a local local planning project a certain

00:40:31
percentage of the budget needs to be

00:40:33
spent on public art now for those who

00:40:36
know this in most cases this rarely

00:40:39
leads in many cases in most cases this

00:40:41
does not lead to very interesting types

00:40:43
of art it's a kind of tick to box

00:40:45
exercise in some cases of course it does

00:40:47
so she develops the kind of critique of

00:40:49
how public art is instrumentalized in

00:40:53
order to further you could say the

00:40:55
uneven development of New York City so

00:40:57
it kind of shaped by Elite concerns and

00:41:01
shape of political political economic

00:41:02
concerns

00:41:04
so public garden becomes a kind of

00:41:06
legitimation device for uneven

00:41:08
development uneven development

00:41:10
the issue briefly refers and I mentioned

00:41:12
here because I like the term to the term

00:41:14
pseudo pseudo public sphere which is a

00:41:17
critique of Alexander klug and another

00:41:19
theorist on the sort of this idea of

00:41:21
Harvard Martian kind of Ideal public

00:41:24
sphere as a field of deliberation where

00:41:26
he says well actually there's very

00:41:27
little actual dialogue taking place but

00:41:31
she also hints that and this is

00:41:32
something that for example Nancy Fraser

00:41:34
and other theorists later data also

00:41:36
developed in more detail perhaps to this

00:41:39
idea of the emerges oppositional public

00:41:41
spheres yes there is uneven development

00:41:43
but it kind of pseudo public sphere but

00:41:45
we also see kind of oppositional public

00:41:47
spheres emerging public spheres which

00:41:49
which on top of that have a heavy

00:41:52
emphasis on let's say cultural and

00:41:53
aesthetic Dimensions so basically often

00:41:56
artistic communities are related to

00:41:58
actors being engaged in the design of

00:42:01
oppositional public spheres and again of

00:42:03
course this especially for those

00:42:04
interested in the Arts has been of

00:42:07
massive influence and thinking to what

00:42:08
kind of role can the Arts play in in the

00:42:11
urban and in urban development at Large

00:42:16
now here's a nice quote Thing by

00:42:18
Deutsche that summarizes like uh

00:42:20
basically this this kind of idea and the

00:42:22
critique also so the idea that art

00:42:24
cannot assume the existence of a public

00:42:26
what must help produce one and that the

00:42:30
public sphere is less a physical space

00:42:31
than a social nullify to a considerable

00:42:35
considerable extent accepted divisions

00:42:38
between public and non-public art

00:42:39
potentially any exhibition venue is a

00:42:42
public sphere and conversely the

00:42:44
location of artworks outside privately

00:42:46
owned galleries in parks and plazas or

00:42:49
simply Outdoors hardly guarantees that

00:42:51
you will address the public

00:42:53
now I'm sure that the the this quote

00:42:55
perhaps needs a bit of unpacking right

00:42:57
um but basically what she's trying to

00:42:59
get at here is in the first sentence is

00:43:02
that we cannot assume that by simply

00:43:04
let's say putting public art on a Public

00:43:06
Square for example we cannot assume that

00:43:09
we automatically address the public yeah

00:43:12
people just don't mind not engage with

00:43:14
it uh people just that might just be

00:43:17
there but but that doesn't really make

00:43:19
it public right we can only make it

00:43:22
public if it actually is actively engage

00:43:24
with people so you actually you actually

00:43:26
have to construct a public and this is

00:43:28
more than what most public Arts

00:43:30
supposedly public art achieves yeah

00:43:34
at this so this this is the first

00:43:36
question the question you're the first

00:43:38
critique she has the second line is okay

00:43:40
we we this actually leads If You Think

00:43:43
Through The Logical conclusions of this

00:43:44
it means that

00:43:46
it uh simply by putting uh arts in the

00:43:50
out in the open doesn't make public art

00:43:53
but it also means that for example we

00:43:54
can have public arts in a gallery yeah

00:43:58
as long as you engage with the public

00:44:00
this obviously would constitute public

00:44:01
art so she critiques this distinction

00:44:04
within much of our theory of that time

00:44:06
uh that that relied on this idea that uh

00:44:10
a critique of let's say Modern Art is

00:44:12
that you move out of move out of the

00:44:14
gallery and into the public she says

00:44:16
well actually yes that's a good idea but

00:44:18
it doesn't really make for public art

00:44:20
per se

00:44:21
so this is basically the kind of let's

00:44:23
say dichotomy she's playing with and

00:44:25
that are important I think to uh to um

00:44:29
well to keep in mind

00:44:31
short summary most important thing to

00:44:34
keep in mind is that that we have an art

00:44:36
object but this art object needs actual

00:44:39
engagement with an audience with the

00:44:41
public in order to become public yeah

00:44:44
that's that's important to keep in mind

00:44:46
here

00:44:50
to make it a bit more uh concrete she

00:44:53
she has one very famous example

00:44:57
um by an equally famous artist although

00:45:01
not not at the time I think he was still

00:45:03
relatively let's say young in his career

00:45:05
at that point in time

00:45:06
um which is Richard Sarah's tilted Arc

00:45:09
this example is also discussed in the in

00:45:11
the paper by

00:45:12
um uh by uh by Deutsche

00:45:15
now as you can see on the on the image

00:45:17
here

00:45:18
this is quite obviously an intervention

00:45:21
in public space right it's a massive

00:45:24
piece of work it's a 37 meter long and

00:45:26
3.7 meter tall steel plate on Foley

00:45:29
Square which is uh in lower Manhattan

00:45:32
New York yeah

00:45:34
so if anything this this is this is a

00:45:36
kind of public artwork that you cannot

00:45:38
ignore obviously

00:45:41
now the way sort of this

00:45:43
um according to Deutsche the way sort of

00:45:45
this

00:45:46
um uh this artwork has been sort of uh

00:45:50
um let's say interpreted or let's say

00:45:51
received and it really shows some of the

00:45:53
problems of of public art as she she

00:45:55
made as she sees it

00:45:57
um some of you could say some of the

00:45:58
more conservative voices or sort of use

00:46:01
of the public space heavily criticize

00:46:03
this this piece of piece of art because

00:46:05
it basically it blocks their way of

00:46:08
Passage obviously right if you look at

00:46:10
the image uh it it it completely makes

00:46:13
impossible the usage of of the of the

00:46:15
Public Square by um by uh let's say

00:46:19
workers working moving from one building

00:46:21
to the next yeah at the same time uh

00:46:25
Deutsche argues well this doesn't

00:46:26
necessarily make it public arts and some

00:46:28
of the exaggerated claims made by

00:46:30
critical let's say Defenders of of this

00:46:33
piece of work uh they have really

00:46:35
focused you could say on assumptions as

00:46:37
the shifts in behavior of disposed uses

00:46:40
of this space so without actually

00:46:42
talking to people without actually

00:46:44
engaging with their own interests they

00:46:46
have assumed that the very fact that

00:46:48
people had to sort of re-articulate

00:46:50
their let's say everyday practices that

00:46:52
that led to a more aesthetic engagement

00:46:54
with the public space

00:46:56
now according to Deutsche the main

00:46:58
problem of the the discourse around this

00:47:01
this piece of art as well as the piece

00:47:04
of art itself is that it relied on a

00:47:06
very narrow aesthetic reading so

00:47:09
ignoring actual uses of urban space to

00:47:11
very generic claims on ecstatic uses of

00:47:14
the square yeah so actually it's a kind

00:47:16
of public art Intervention which refuses

00:47:20
to be public because it doesn't engage

00:47:22
in any sense with the public so this

00:47:24
idea that the public involves a dialogue

00:47:26
is completely ignored in this sense it's

00:47:28
basically and ultimately a strong artist

00:47:32
figure putting an art piece in a Public

00:47:35
Square without actually becoming part

00:47:37
and engaging with the public now this

00:47:40
piece was also removed in 1989 after

00:47:42
years of of critique but that's perhaps

00:47:45
a side note for the debate here

00:47:48
the counter example uh perhaps

00:47:51
oppositional public sphere You could

00:47:52
argue that that Deutsche uses and I

00:47:54
think this is a an artwork that that has

00:47:57
also been picked up by artists such as

00:47:59
Neil Smith who also wrote a piece on

00:48:01
this

00:48:02
um it's just of what just caused the

00:48:04
homeless vehicle project also a public

00:48:06
art space but a different kind of animal

00:48:09
so here in this case the vehicle decided

00:48:11
that I had a lab by the way when looking

00:48:13
at this picture because I'm pretty sure

00:48:14
it is the Trump Tower in the back but

00:48:16
that's something else

00:48:18
[Music]

00:48:19
which at that point in time had less of

00:48:22
a less of symbolic value perhaps in it

00:48:24
than it has now

00:48:26
um that's a different kind of animal

00:48:27
it's also public art

00:48:30
um also metal in many ways but here it's

00:48:33
a vehicle designed by artists by the

00:48:35
artist sorry and singular in

00:48:36
consultation with homeless people and it

00:48:39
was seen in a different way it was seen

00:48:40
as a practical tool for managing

00:48:43
everyday life of the homeless so in this

00:48:45
thing which you can let's say expand

00:48:47
when uh once when when when uh placed

00:48:51
somewhere uh it was a space for washing

00:48:54
for sleeping but also for storage space

00:48:56
for example for collecting empty bottles

00:48:58
or something

00:48:59
um so all this in into one one vehicle

00:49:03
vehicle sorry

00:49:05
this was both an exhibition object which

00:49:07
was exhibited in you could say classic

00:49:09
galleries as well as an objects for

00:49:11
actually making visible the homeless in

00:49:13
public space

00:49:15
so it's it I think on the base of this

00:49:17
example you already feel a bit to kind

00:49:19
of did let's say different approach uh

00:49:21
used uh towards the public by this this

00:49:25
piece of work or by the previous piece

00:49:27
by by Richard Sarah because here there

00:49:29
is an engagement with specific Urban

00:49:31
users highly marginalized you use on top

00:49:34
of this uh and thus implicitly or

00:49:37
explicitly a critique of uneven Urban

00:49:39
developments because it's a piece of

00:49:41
work that is situated in public space

00:49:43
and makes visible you could say the

00:49:45
effects of on the Urban Development on a

00:49:49
wider group of let's say Urban users

00:49:56
see whoops all right to my screens here

00:50:04
okay maybe to wrap up here on this on

00:50:06
this first strand of of research so

00:50:09
these are all examples of site-specific

00:50:11
art that that that moved art beyond the

00:50:13
exhibition space into the urban so there

00:50:16
was a thing within our Theory and art

00:50:17
and art history kind of internal

00:50:19
critique of the art worlds we have to

00:50:21
move out of the museums out of the

00:50:23
galleries but also a broadening or and

00:50:26
and sort of as a result of that also a

00:50:29
broadening of aesthetic debates to wider

00:50:31
social concerns

00:50:32
so this then leads to to Notions such as

00:50:35
going by critically in this case by by

00:50:37
Health Foster such as the Artist as a

00:50:39
sonographer which looks at the role of

00:50:41
the artist in the collaborative process

00:50:43
or the or the Artist as a participant

00:50:45
Observer so the artist has an

00:50:47
ethnographer

00:50:48
um so a critique of foster is also I

00:50:51
think this has been picked up in in

00:50:53
later work also is that the

00:50:54
globalization of our market and this is

00:50:56
where let's say different disciplinary

00:50:58
debates also become interesting that the

00:51:00
globalization of the Art Market this is

00:51:02
something rarely addressed sufficiently

00:51:04
I think in urban studies leads for

00:51:06
example to commissioning of artists to

00:51:07
produce a community-based site-specific

00:51:10
artworks however without the clear

00:51:12
knowledge of the local context so we see

00:51:15
let's say the bayonet by and biannual

00:51:17
Logic for example the Art Festival logic

00:51:19
where artists are are flown into

00:51:21
particular sites in order to develop

00:51:23
community-based work but they rarely

00:51:25
know the community so often these are uh

00:51:28
let's say only superficially speaking uh

00:51:31
Public Works uh of works of public Arts

00:51:36
and again so much of this was

00:51:38
foreshadowed a thing by the work of

00:51:40
Deutsche also but of course also others

00:51:41
at this point in time

00:51:44
okay

00:51:48
so that's the first strand of research

00:51:50
a second strand of research is around

00:51:52
Artisans Urban social movements and of

00:51:54
course I'm making analytical

00:51:55
distinctions here in practice some of

00:51:57
these debates overlap and there are

00:51:59
interactions but for the purpose of

00:52:01
discussion I think it's helpful to keep

00:52:02
them a bit separate

00:52:04
so the second strand of research tries

00:52:06
to look at artists and Earth social

00:52:07
movements so there's a long-standing

00:52:09
tradition obviously

00:52:10
of artists engaging in social movements

00:52:13
but mostly those have been researched I

00:52:16
would argue outside of urban studies

00:52:17
again within let's say the the the the

00:52:20
the field specific debates such as

00:52:23
theater or such as as our visual studies

00:52:26
Etc or art history

00:52:27
within our studies I think uh most of

00:52:31
the recent debates in this area has been

00:52:34
on the critique of the creative class

00:52:35
and creative Industries policies has

00:52:37
already hinted that or perhaps

00:52:40
neoliberal or entrepreneurial urbanism

00:52:42
more widely so what kind of role do

00:52:44
artists play in or part of urban social

00:52:48
movements and critiquing you could say

00:52:50
the neo-liberalization of of the urban

00:52:56
now it is a nice paper actually by

00:52:58
Johannes Novi and Claire colon who many

00:53:00
of you have seen attended today who

00:53:03
wrote a nice paper on struggling for the

00:53:05
right to the creative City in Berlin and

00:53:07
Hamburg and where they give a nice brief

00:53:10
brief but nice overview I think of urban

00:53:13
social movements uh so it's a kind of

00:53:16
literature which I'd well we don't

00:53:18
really discuss a thing in our social

00:53:20
geography that's an important literature

00:53:22
which moves from the history of

00:53:24
squatting and demonstrations against a

00:53:26
renewal uh politics to Urban Counter

00:53:28
Culture

00:53:30
um and then zoom in on the role of

00:53:32
artists and cultural workers in

00:53:33
contesting uh called creative class and

00:53:36
creative Industries politics now there's

00:53:38
a lot that can be said about this but

00:53:40
what is interesting here of course is

00:53:41
that automatically the debate becomes

00:53:43
you could say sociological or social

00:53:44
scientific because the moment you start

00:53:47
looking at artists within social

00:53:48
movements you can no longer look just at

00:53:50
their aesthetic Expressions but you

00:53:52
automatically have to look at what is

00:53:53
practically speaking their role with an

00:53:55
often quite heterogeneous diverse

00:53:58
composition of protest movements so we

00:54:00
see artists collaborating with diverse

00:54:02
set of actors and that of course shapes

00:54:05
their artistic practice

00:54:07
the role of artists here at least this

00:54:09
is what no vehicle highlights uh

00:54:11
highlights strongly I think they they

00:54:13
are definitely on to something there is

00:54:15
that artists and to some extent have a

00:54:17
privileged role or a particular role

00:54:19
within Urban social movements because

00:54:21
they have access to an experience with

00:54:23
media networks and a familiarity with

00:54:25
communication techniques so this then

00:54:28
leads to a discussion around the role of

00:54:29
artists in in how let's say particular

00:54:32
Urban conflicts are framed and reframed

00:54:34
by artists in an often in visual or

00:54:37
other ways

00:54:41
now there are many examples you can

00:54:43
discuss here this is one example

00:54:44
discussed also in the in the article of

00:54:47
the media protest in Berlin uh for those

00:54:50
that know Berlin you will know probably

00:54:51
also know sort of the history a bit of

00:54:53
media I should be I will now discuss

00:54:54
this here it's a big Urban Development

00:54:56
uh area uh on let's say well the

00:55:01
southern part of free design northern

00:55:02
part of course pack

00:55:04
um

00:55:05
partially which really let's let the

00:55:07
counter mobilization uh because this is

00:55:10
also the area which is let's say you

00:55:12
have a a concentration of artistic and

00:55:14
and and Leisure and clubbing activity so

00:55:18
here's a one

00:55:20
simple example where sort of artists you

00:55:22
could say have been involved in

00:55:24
developing different let's say visual

00:55:26
Aesthetics in a sense this basically

00:55:28
ironically Builds on the B Berlin

00:55:30
branding scheme so for those who don't

00:55:32
know it just Google it and it uses the

00:55:34
same kind of design but then changes the

00:55:38
kind of language right and sort of

00:55:39
ironically so instead of being hip being

00:55:42
creative and being uh how to translate

00:55:45
that if I can translate that being

00:55:49
well used and thrown away so to speak

00:55:51
modifiable yeah commodifiables perhaps

00:55:54
the closest yeah thank you very very

00:55:55
good point for real bus sounds better

00:55:57
though but you're right commodifiable

00:55:59
and they replace it by size

00:56:02
so it could be self

00:56:05
Again difficult to try itself uh

00:56:09
um

00:56:11
independent something along those lines

00:56:14
solidarity solidarity uh and be

00:56:17
resistance so stop gentrification so

00:56:20
this is one example

00:56:22
other examples of course not discussing

00:56:24
this particular article but um

00:56:26
uh from other

00:56:28
um other sites of course this kind of

00:56:31
artistic let's say framing of political

00:56:33
and urban conflicts ties in with a much

00:56:35
much longer history of Art and pro-step

00:56:38
protest most obviously in street art as

00:56:40
well as graphic design so there are a

00:56:42
couple of examples that are let's say

00:56:44
illustrative of this but certainly not

00:56:45
exhaustive so on the top right you see a

00:56:48
performance protest of an extension

00:56:49
extension Extinction Rebellion uh

00:56:52
protest in London uh do the middle left

00:56:54
I think has been quite a similar visible

00:56:57
to most if you would think black lives

00:57:00
matter paint the street I think this one

00:57:01
indeed Washington DC or to the bottom

00:57:04
right

00:57:05
a a

00:57:07
claim State well if a painting stating

00:57:10
the load to the debt repayments uh on

00:57:13
Street Arts intervention in Buenos Aires

00:57:15
yeah and I could have used many many

00:57:17
other examples but just to give a sense

00:57:20
of uh of the various sort of artists

00:57:22
play a role in in urban social movements

00:57:25
or at least early protests if it's less

00:57:27
organized than than a social movement

00:57:29
and again this has a much much longer

00:57:32
history uh going back uh many many years

00:57:35
some would argue since the emergence of

00:57:37
industrialization in many ways

00:57:40
about where are you

00:57:43
so the last

00:57:45
one yeah sorry

00:57:49
so the last round within this section

00:57:51
that I want to discuss with you

00:57:53
um is popular cultural and urban

00:57:55
politics

00:57:57
um this is last you could say less

00:57:59
around Urban social movement it also

00:58:01
lasts around the art world as such but

00:58:03
more about more broader cultural

00:58:05
expressions so here we really go back to

00:58:07
the classical core of cultural studies

00:58:09
that I discussed before with you to use

00:58:11
the focus on popular culture

00:58:13
as in everyday life as questioning

00:58:16
Authority but also as imagining

00:58:17
political Alternatives so the kind of

00:58:20
language that we then uh use or see use

00:58:23
in this kind of research is that there's

00:58:25
a it's about politics Beyond governments

00:58:27
and politicians to work on the street

00:58:29
Politics As I said about called it or

00:58:32
also kind of informalization and this is

00:58:34
where the informality the term pops up

00:58:36
again as you see informalization of the

00:58:38
State uh as for example Julian Boudreau

00:58:41
has called it a nice nice book by the

00:58:44
way

00:58:46
again there are many many examples here

00:58:48
to to to to to to to discuss the classic

00:58:52
case I would argue in this in this field

00:58:54
of research is hip-hop or rap rap music

00:58:57
more narrowly

00:58:59
which has been studied by now I think by

00:59:01
multiple multiple disciplines range from

00:59:02
musicology cultural studies anthropology

00:59:05
but also Urban studies which

00:59:07
traditionally has Focus I think strongly

00:59:09
on account of classic cultural studies

00:59:11
Community orientation Urban localities

00:59:13
and so the hood the ghetto as classic

00:59:16
Urban teams but which also I think in a

00:59:19
more critical literature uh has paid

00:59:21
attention to let's say the way rap

00:59:24
hip-hop culture has become less they

00:59:26
commodified in in its globalization of

00:59:29
of of its cultural form yeah but also

00:59:32
how it has been picked up by people from

00:59:34
outside of let's say the us as as

00:59:36
opposed to the source of of hip-hop

00:59:39
culture so that's the classic case the

00:59:42
library is full of books by now I think

00:59:44
on hip-hop there's some more interesting

00:59:46
than others this book by Murray Foreman

00:59:48
is quite uh quite an interesting example

00:59:51
though

00:59:51
similar research has also been done in

00:59:53
other genres uh typically a lot of

00:59:55
attention has been paid to music we see

00:59:57
it in other fields of activity also but

00:59:59
music has received perhaps most

01:00:00
attention in relation to popular culture

01:00:02
and the political

01:00:03
ranging from clubbing culture but also

01:00:06
Opera a lot of political perhaps less

01:00:07
obviously there to punk to Jazz to all

01:00:10
kinds of other cultural expressions

01:00:17
laughs

01:00:19
now with all these strands um

01:00:22
amount to is that they point to

01:00:24
different aesthetic strategies to engage

01:00:26
the urban yeah and this is something

01:00:28
that uh well as as also increasingly

01:00:32
received attention within Urban studies

01:00:34
um in an article about team and bias I

01:00:36
put a reference at the bottom of the

01:00:38
slides it points to a number of

01:00:39
different aesthetic strategies they as I

01:00:43
said as a right here they are

01:00:44
analytically distinct but in practice of

01:00:47
course they are they can they are

01:00:48
Messier it's some some let's say

01:00:50
aesthetic practices might be uh involved

01:00:53
in a number of things at the same time

01:00:55
here we said okay we basically we have

01:00:57
spectacle Grassroots Social Work

01:00:59
arousing the census and you can

01:01:01
automatically see a thing to have some

01:01:03
of the examples I've I've shown before

01:01:05
can be one or more of these things so

01:01:08
let's say for example the black lives

01:01:10
matter

01:01:12
um let's say Banner on the street so to

01:01:14
speak in a way you could argue this is

01:01:16
Grassroots uh you could argue this is

01:01:19
also social work you could argue with

01:01:21
some some I would also arouses the

01:01:23
senses because it's it's sometimes it

01:01:25
questions the Norms of what these trees

01:01:27
are for and questions different let's

01:01:29
say media representations but quite

01:01:32
obviously it's also spectacle because it

01:01:34
has really sort of traveled widely and

01:01:37
can easily be used any kind of

01:01:38
commodification strategy almost of

01:01:41
branding almost particular cities yeah

01:01:43
so there are all kinds of different

01:01:45
dimensions and it's it's an empirical

01:01:46
question ultimately to look at concrete

01:01:49
artistic practices to look at what the

01:01:51
different dimensions uh let's say their

01:01:53
relation to each other is

01:01:57
okay that's a long stretch for one uh

01:02:01
one slide but it might also be one of

01:02:03
the longer uh longer discussions

01:02:06
uh I'll take a short break here four

01:02:09
questions so please

01:02:11
um just either type them in the chat or

01:02:13
just start unmuting and speaking if if

01:02:16
there are any questions on this section

01:02:17
it gives me a chance to drink a bit of

01:02:19
water

01:02:24
wow that was a pre-prepared question

01:02:26
that was a fast or unless you type very

01:02:29
fast

01:02:30
so already can answer the question uh or

01:02:33
or a point I want to raise attention to

01:02:35
your related phenomenon where an

01:02:37
artistic creative approach

01:02:39
is used in part uh of a broader

01:02:42
participatory and Redevelopment strategy

01:02:44
here's some sort of institutionalizing

01:02:46
of arts and their movements is happening

01:02:48
as small quirky teams of Architects

01:02:50
planners activists and artists are

01:02:51
leading the process and through an

01:02:53
example and then there's a website maybe

01:02:56
you can so if if I understand you

01:02:59
correctly we won't look at the example

01:03:01
now

01:03:02
then it's your point being that artists

01:03:05
can actually be become Urban developers

01:03:07
themselves

01:03:11
will be good

01:03:15
I don't see you so you have to I have to

01:03:17
unmute the weekend now I see you but

01:03:18
you're immunity all right sorry

01:03:21
um yeah uh exactly like artists are

01:03:24
becoming part of the planning process or

01:03:27
more I think that the

01:03:29
um I think the low threshold uh approach

01:03:34
of like artistic experimental like

01:03:37
creativeness

01:03:38
as being employed in order to like

01:03:42
justify maybe participatory processes or

01:03:45
lead to a more like inclusion of people

01:03:48
or like let them participate participate

01:03:52
in the first place but also just to uh

01:03:54
get uh the people on board and create

01:03:57
some sort of tolerance so they this one

01:04:00
would be like the creative what is it

01:04:03
called the Festival of creative Urban

01:04:06
living in Milton Keynes

01:04:09
um the UK England uh so yeah it's like

01:04:14
uh it sounds like coming from a very

01:04:17
like dry urban planning background this

01:04:20
is like a weird thing to do because

01:04:23
people who are attending this they're

01:04:25
usually not aware of the broader scope

01:04:27
of this whole development that's

01:04:29
happening to them

01:04:31
um so that's just interesting to to also

01:04:33
take absolutely it's a good addition

01:04:35
something that I don't explicitly

01:04:37
mention here but it's a it's a

01:04:39
relatively new trend I think certainly

01:04:41
something that we see more and more of

01:04:42
the last I mean it was there before but

01:04:45
it has become more visible I think in

01:04:46
the last 10 years

01:04:48
um I would still argue though that the

01:04:50
same kind of critical vocabulary already

01:04:52
introduced by Deutsche is also necessary

01:04:54
for these projects because in some of

01:04:56
these projects or initiatives at least

01:04:58
we do see a relatively instrumental or

01:05:01
instrumentalization of artists I.E not

01:05:04
the one artist is not the other artists

01:05:05
right so we see certain artists

01:05:09
um standing up as entrepreneurs you

01:05:11
could say and becoming project

01:05:13
developers in relatively uncritical ways

01:05:15
and I can name some examples also in

01:05:18
Brussels where there's um where this is

01:05:21
happening which actually leads to a fair

01:05:24
amount of uh critique also within the

01:05:27
artistic Community yeah and I wouldn't

01:05:29
say uh that this is like necessarily

01:05:32
like a bad or a good thing like the

01:05:34
themes that are involved are like really

01:05:36
good uh teams but it's just uh like

01:05:39
always like look look very critical

01:05:41
because also the urban governments try

01:05:43
sometimes to use this strategy in a very

01:05:47
deceiving way yeah okay excellent thank

01:05:49
you I see another calendar or comment

01:05:51
literally by Vera

01:05:53
please unmute

01:05:56
yeah but but you already write this

01:05:59
critic from the what is her name yeah

01:06:03
and he's also the critic from zurkin

01:06:06
like did this tricky fact of the art to

01:06:09
be also the vehicle of the

01:06:11
gentrification and and stuff so uh

01:06:15
it's always super tricky to speak about

01:06:17
the art and it's potential in urban

01:06:21
space let's say yeah absolutely so I'll

01:06:24
give another example later on I think

01:06:25
also which which is and the article I

01:06:28
mentioned by uh sorry was uh I can't go

01:06:31
back I can't go back I buy Timon base

01:06:33
also mentioned some of these

01:06:35
ambivalences that are seemingly

01:06:38
unavoidable so to speak there's no pure

01:06:40
space in that sense okay excellent and

01:06:42
then there's Max also has a comment

01:06:44
yeah just to add on this point that uh

01:06:49
urica raised and this theme of

01:06:52
institutionalization and

01:06:54
instrumentalization of of Art and

01:06:56
artists I think Amsterdam is actually an

01:06:59
interesting example because there is

01:07:01
this Municipal policy which could be

01:07:05
translated as the breeding ground policy

01:07:07
whereby the city assigns certain

01:07:10
buildings as available for workshops and

01:07:14
for artists

01:07:15
to work there and often it's also very

01:07:18
related to

01:07:21
um

01:07:21
yeah strategy actually to gentrify a

01:07:25
particular area I don't know whether

01:07:27
there's any research done on this plus

01:07:30
maybe you know uh yeah it has been

01:07:32
definitely also by the Amsterdam

01:07:34
colleagues who also have a strong Urban

01:07:35
studies research Tradition at the

01:07:36
University of Amsterdam but also others

01:07:38
uh no no that has been critical research

01:07:40
being done at the Netherlands is a

01:07:41
particular case it's an interesting case

01:07:43
in any case because it's it's very less

01:07:45
the advanced and professional and it is

01:07:47
instrumentalization of the Arts on the

01:07:49
urban level and the brute plus and the

01:07:52
breeding policy policy is yeah it's it's

01:07:56
striking in the way it's sort of

01:07:58
well use and test positive side effects

01:08:00
also but the way it literally uses the

01:08:03
Arts in in relatively classical Urban

01:08:06
Development strategies that's that's

01:08:07
that's definitely uh true yeah no the

01:08:10
research has been done in that yeah

01:08:12
okay excellent thank you for the

01:08:13
comments they they really add some very

01:08:16
important uh additional thoughts here

01:08:18
other points

01:08:20
if not I continue with the third part uh

01:08:23
of the presentation and that's the the

01:08:26
another section or direction of research

01:08:29
on the

01:08:31
uh on the Arts well also on on culture

01:08:34
uh and the urban this is what I would

01:08:37
call or this this is basically my label

01:08:39
but I think it's what I would call

01:08:40
research on cultural infrastructures and

01:08:42
informal urbanism so that's whether

01:08:44
that's in the literature on your formula

01:08:45
actually starts uh broadening to let's

01:08:48
say a literature on on informal urbanism

01:08:51
which might be a phrase that you've come

01:08:52
across also a number of times

01:08:54
and this overlaps the thing in recent

01:08:56
years where increasing attention has

01:08:58
been paid to let's see the

01:08:59
infrastructural dimension of urban

01:09:00
cultures some Scholars have already

01:09:03
talked about an infrastructural turn I I

01:09:05
dislike talking about terms because it's

01:09:07
very

01:09:08
claiming a new fashion and it helps to

01:09:10
get cited more but uh yeah there's some

01:09:13
all these things built on all on older

01:09:15
interest also having said that there is

01:09:17
obviously more and more attention being

01:09:19
paid within Urban studies to let's see

01:09:21
questions of infrastructure uh and not

01:09:23
just narrowly defined but a very diverse

01:09:26
types of infrastructure as you will see

01:09:28
now let's hear one example I think which

01:09:30
is a good example of it discussed by the

01:09:32
team and base article that I mentioned

01:09:34
before

01:09:35
um which you discussed in this article

01:09:37
is it is is the work of the

01:09:39
chicago-based artist yester Gates as

01:09:42
some of you might know him

01:09:44
um where to the left you see a piece

01:09:46
that you did for the documentary

01:09:52
well not biannual but documentary five

01:09:55
yearly uh Festival in Castle so the

01:09:58
documentary 2013 which I think was in

01:10:00

01:10:04
eugenotes house which basically is a

01:10:06
restoration of an empty building in

01:10:08
castle using labor and materials from

01:10:10
the south side of Chicago

01:10:12
so it's an interesting case because it

01:10:14
was a kind of rundown building in Castle

01:10:16
and where he had let's say we had the

01:10:19
thoughtiest against the artists had

01:10:20
materials but also workers moved

01:10:23
transported so to say from Chicago to

01:10:25
Castle to actually renovate the building

01:10:28
and to actually perform in the building

01:10:31
Etc

01:10:31
so here's space and let's say the

01:10:34
infrastructure of this space really

01:10:36
emerged as a kind of social space while

01:10:38
at the same time directing attention to

01:10:40
migrant labor and in the case of of the

01:10:42
SD Gates that is work and the kind of

01:10:44
the issues he engages with with black

01:10:46
cultural expression in a very particular

01:10:49
space in Castle so there's a very let's

01:10:51
see concrete artistic intervention

01:10:54
to the right you see let's say the

01:10:57
in a way the reference project for for

01:10:59
the castle uh the castle case which is

01:11:02
the Dorchester project or projects in

01:11:05
Chicago which is basically you can argue

01:11:07
and it links back I think to the

01:11:08
previous

01:11:09
um uh uh well addition raised by by the

01:11:13
week but perhaps in the last let's say

01:11:15
uh uh planner mode but basically this is

01:11:19
a kind of urban development project led

01:11:21
by Siesta gates in the south side of

01:11:23
Chicago where the gate started buying up

01:11:26
abandoned property after the 2008

01:11:28
financial crisis and has redeveloped

01:11:30
these buildings with local communities

01:11:32
with other artists uh often creating a

01:11:35
mixed of outer spaces of community

01:11:38
spaces of let's say local restaurants or

01:11:41
in this particular case also a library

01:11:43
and and archive uh so the the Dorchester

01:11:47
project

01:11:49
now what's interesting here of course is

01:11:50
that we we

01:11:52
um we we are still in the realm of let's

01:11:54
say issues around Urban culture but

01:11:56
we've started paying more and more

01:11:58
attention to okay where practically

01:11:59
literally materially speaking are these

01:12:02
are these located so this really leads

01:12:04
them to the material infrastructure

01:12:05
dimension of urban culture and some of

01:12:08
what I consider to be some of the more

01:12:10
interesting more productive line of

01:12:12
research on Urban culture in the last

01:12:14
years has really looked at these kind of

01:12:16
infrastructural dimensions

01:12:25
another pushing this a bit broader and

01:12:27
perhaps also becoming less local and his

01:12:29
orientation towards infrastructure

01:12:32
is um a book that I that I added for the

01:12:36
reading for today uh by Brian Larkin

01:12:38
from 2008.

01:12:40
signal and noise media infrastructure

01:12:43
and urban culture in Nigeria

01:12:45
which is for those that have rats I

01:12:48
don't I don't expect you to have read

01:12:49
the full book but maybe it may be the

01:12:51
introduction at least

01:12:53
which is an anthropological study on the

01:12:55
cultural work of media Technologies

01:12:58
this is the quote and their role in what

01:13:00
in producing what we call Urban Africa

01:13:02
focusing on Kano and a Muslim City in

01:13:05
Northern Islamic City and Northern

01:13:07
Nigeria

01:13:08
the Larkin book is interesting because

01:13:10
it's just a very interesting book but

01:13:12
also because he Flags a number of

01:13:15
debates that that are let's say

01:13:17
essential in research on infrastructures

01:13:20
or in general or cultural

01:13:22
infrastructures in particular

01:13:23
one being it's not just about let's say

01:13:26
pipes Etc and literally infrastructure

01:13:29
but also a lot about the symbolic of

01:13:31
representational logic of

01:13:33
infrastructures so what do

01:13:35
infrastructures mean how are they

01:13:37
interpreted how are they envisioned how

01:13:38
are they imagined this really receives a

01:13:40
lot of attention I think in in most of

01:13:42
the infrastructure research

01:13:45
also in terms of governments to go to

01:13:47
govern or control these infrastructures

01:13:49
uh it gives examples of uh of this in

01:13:52
the case of Nigeria

01:13:54
um at the same time also the unexpected

01:13:57
or unintended consequences of an

01:13:58
infrastructural development governments

01:14:01
for example or let's say our local

01:14:02
developers can have a plan okay can have

01:14:05
an idea as to why they want to develop a

01:14:07
certain infrastructure but it doesn't

01:14:09
necessarily mean that infrastructure is

01:14:10
also used in this way so here we back a

01:14:13
thing to perhaps to the older discussion

01:14:14
around strategies and tactics but

01:14:16
transpose to an infrastructural

01:14:18
discussion

01:14:20
and the other and the last element

01:14:21
related to this of course is that around

01:14:23
these infrastructures we see all kinds

01:14:26
of informal social practices in everyday

01:14:27
life emerging yeah which then are word

01:14:30
of attention but also worthy of of

01:14:32
research so the example here I gave for

01:14:35
example you can easily get very

01:14:36
concretely imagine how around these

01:14:39
spaces social practices emerge and are

01:14:42
and are developed and they would perhaps

01:14:45
not exist without these these

01:14:47
infrastructures and that's the thing the

01:14:48
importance important to keep in mind

01:14:50
here

01:14:52
foreign

01:14:56
for me the most interesting

01:14:58
chapter in the book is perhaps the what

01:15:01
is the last chapter if I remember

01:15:02
correctly on on the role of piracy in in

01:15:06
Nigeria so the examples he gives for

01:15:08
example is is how Nigerian video

01:15:12
and piracy a circus of distribution

01:15:14
emerged in Nigeria uh and how this

01:15:18
actually relates to a kind of what

01:15:19
perhaps which goes called a full

01:15:21
ecosystem of cultural but also obviously

01:15:23
economic activity largely informal in

01:15:26
the sense that it's barely regulated uh

01:15:29
perhaps also uh illegal or

01:15:33
illegitimate or something because it's

01:15:35
uh often at that point in time when he

01:15:37
did his research late 1990s early 2000s

01:15:40
uh often copies illegal copies of

01:15:42
Hollywood and Indian films but we're a

01:15:45
bit at the same encano as a northern

01:15:47
Nigeria City really emerging literally

01:15:49
literally as a kind of Distribution Hub

01:15:51
for The Wider African region yeah so

01:15:54
with people on the right for example

01:15:56
selling it on the street but also the

01:15:58
same people or other people actually

01:15:59
moving the the goods so to speak the

01:16:02
material from one city to other cities

01:16:03
often crossing boundaries

01:16:06
now from the 1990s onwards I think we've

01:16:09
seen an increase in production also and

01:16:11
this is the the the argument developed

01:16:13
by Larkin of Nigerian and especially

01:16:16
hausa language videos leading to a quite

01:16:18
organized system of how is that video

01:16:20
Film Production but it building on the

01:16:23
existing pirate infrastructure yeah so

01:16:26
again a classic case of informal

01:16:29
urbanism a very slippery or unclear

01:16:32
distinction between where when is

01:16:34
something still informal when does

01:16:36
something become full because it has

01:16:38
also become part to a certain extent of

01:16:40
a formal registered economy with some

01:16:42
businesses growing bigger and bigger but

01:16:45
at the same time with for example how is

01:16:47
the films aesthetically and

01:16:48
organizationally still being shaped by

01:16:51
you could say the older uh pirate

01:16:53
Aesthetics and infrastructure yeah this

01:16:56
is also the kind of a research which has

01:16:58
received a lot of attention in recent

01:17:00
years and which I have labeled here as

01:17:02
being part of let's say research on

01:17:04
cultural infrastructures and informal

01:17:06
Urban them

01:17:13
or to give another example a paper I

01:17:15
wrote myself together with a with a PhD

01:17:17
student a while ago

01:17:20
gold spaces of openness Urban

01:17:21
citizenship and cultural infrastructures

01:17:23
have come alive in Istanbul

01:17:25
which focused in let's say a more

01:17:27
institutional way perhaps less

01:17:29
ethnographic way on the institutional

01:17:31
geography of collaboration and support

01:17:33
to sustain local cultural spaces and

01:17:36
networks in the shadow of the states so

01:17:38
the argument we develop here is that in

01:17:40
in a turkey and and partially also

01:17:42
nistable increasingly being let's say

01:17:45
shaped by a kind of authoritarian

01:17:47
semi-authoritarian state in any case we

01:17:50
discuss in some detail how particular

01:17:52
cultural organizations salt and pepper

01:17:54
for those that know as Istanbul they

01:17:55
might know the organizations how they

01:17:58
act as kind of cultural infrastructures

01:18:00
of let's say common life or a different

01:18:03
way would be saying oh actually Public

01:18:04
public life in Istanbul largely by

01:18:08
actually collaborating with very many

01:18:10
other organizations but also offering

01:18:12
spaces and this is what the image to the

01:18:14
right shows sorry what this image shows

01:18:17
offering spaces

01:18:19
um uh well no sorry offering actual

01:18:22
space in their buildings to all kinds of

01:18:24
different organs positions so you see a

01:18:27
kind of let's say

01:18:28
hidden or semi-hidden cultural

01:18:30
infrastructure which doesn't easily show

01:18:32
when you look at just the main cultural

01:18:34
organizations but which really shaped

01:18:36
you could say cultural practices in this

01:18:38
particular City and which is only

01:18:40
possible or or in any case is made

01:18:42
possible by the actual existence of

01:18:45
these actual spaces in in these cities

01:18:47
of salt and Depot

01:18:50
so again another

01:18:52
possible let's say entry point into

01:18:55
research on cultural infrastructures and

01:18:57
informal urbanism

01:18:59
last Point perhaps for this slide well

01:19:03
not not the level yeah last example is

01:19:06
what we see happening in the research

01:19:07
and cultural infrastructures much of the

01:19:09
research on Urban culture is research

01:19:11
that is both you could say fundamental

01:19:12
let's say basic basic real academic

01:19:16
research but it also has a strong

01:19:18
applied nature and the notion of

01:19:20
infrastructure has also started to

01:19:21
emerging or started popping up in policy

01:19:24
documents across the world

01:19:27
um that has many consequences not all of

01:19:29
them positive but to a large extent I

01:19:31
think it's an interesting development

01:19:32
where we let's say cultural policy

01:19:36
documents and cultural actual cultural

01:19:38
policy practices did not refer to

01:19:41
infrastructure let's say 10 years ago we

01:19:43
see in the last five years or so we see

01:19:45
various organizations very local and

01:19:47
Regional governments actually using the

01:19:49
notion of infrastructure in order to pay

01:19:51
attention to certain let's say

01:19:53
infrastructural dimensions of of of

01:19:55
cultural of the cultural Industries also

01:19:58
so here are a few examples on the top

01:20:00
left creative City News cultural

01:20:03
infrastructure an integral component of

01:20:04
Canadian communities this is quite

01:20:07
strong and again I think it's critique

01:20:09
of the creative Industries literature

01:20:10
even among policy makers where you say

01:20:12
okay we actually need a wider diversity

01:20:14
of cultural infrastructures that

01:20:17
actually connect with our local

01:20:18
communities whatever that may mean but

01:20:21
that's let's say the game

01:20:22
or for example sustaining London as a

01:20:25
cultural capital why London needs a

01:20:27
cultural infrastructure plan this again

01:20:29
is not a strand of the debate I think in

01:20:31
policy communities where we see because

01:20:34
of the increasing let's say

01:20:35
gentrification and increasing real

01:20:37
estate price and especially Global

01:20:39
cities even policy makers let's say or

01:20:42
let's say mainstream policy has started

01:20:44
realizing that if we continue like this

01:20:46
we will have no artists left in the city

01:20:48
so we need to actually start thinking

01:20:50
about the availability of cultural

01:20:52
infrastructure in our cities and to make

01:20:54
this available literally in order to

01:20:57
sort of uh keep let's say the status of

01:21:00
London as a global City but also as a

01:21:02
cultural City so why London is the

01:21:04
cultural infrastructure plan

01:21:06
a similar debate around cultural

01:21:08
infrastructure in New South Wales which

01:21:10
is this mixer thing also of the Canadian

01:21:13
example I just mentioned and the London

01:21:14
example of availability of space or

01:21:17
another example in Brussels and this is

01:21:19
one I'm partially involved in by

01:21:21
permanent so permanent uh the the name

01:21:24
of the of the association pretty much

01:21:26
sums it up which is a kind of practice

01:21:28
based research I'm also now involved in

01:21:30
where we try to develop an

01:21:31
infrastructure for permanently

01:21:33
affordable and a valid social and

01:21:35
cultural space in Brussels so basically

01:21:37
claiming a space in Brussels which is

01:21:40
open not just to artists but also other

01:21:43
types of users such as refugees such as

01:21:45
social housing such as University

01:21:47
researchers Etc in order to look at

01:21:50
different models of ownership also where

01:21:52
ours are no longer Reliant and other

01:21:55
users on let's say temporary use but I

01:21:57
can actually let's say permanently

01:21:59
literally permanently claim a space

01:22:01
through all kinds of ownership models

01:22:04
partially building on issues around

01:22:05
unless the community land for us or

01:22:08
social cooperatives

01:22:10
cheese

01:22:12
okay that's a lot of information

01:22:14
um just to sum this up if you look at

01:22:17
the cultural infrastructures and

01:22:18
informal urbanism literature I see at

01:22:21
least the following analytical shifts

01:22:23
we have moved the thing from a concern

01:22:26
with the informal economy and

01:22:28
anthropology and development studies and

01:22:29
everyday life tactics and cultural

01:22:31
studies to INF to informal urbanism this

01:22:34
is the term that is perhaps most present

01:22:36
now it's no longer informality as such

01:22:39
but the phrase informal urbanism you see

01:22:40
uh constantly

01:22:42
so we've moved to a situation where

01:22:45
um sorry here we are

01:22:47
we see a continued interest in labor

01:22:50
questions social embeddedness of

01:22:51
economic relations and interrelation of

01:22:54
informal networks and the formal

01:22:56
institutions so all the classic

01:22:57
informality discussions but at the same

01:23:00
time we see a diversification of topics

01:23:02
so it's no longer just about we would

01:23:04
say beautiful labor markets no it's also

01:23:07
about di urbanism it's also about

01:23:10
co-working space it is also about

01:23:12
Guerilla gardening about co-housing or

01:23:14
about artistic interventions in public

01:23:16
space it's also about squatting it's

01:23:18
also about self-built housing and the

01:23:20
list is endless yeah all these kinds of

01:23:23
practices of course each but they're all

01:23:24
with their own and I see approaches and

01:23:27
styles you see all these kinds of

01:23:29
practice being

01:23:30
labeled as expressions of informal

01:23:34
urbanism

01:23:35
there's a legitimate question to ask how

01:23:37
useful such a slippery term is but it

01:23:40
has certainly led to a broadening of

01:23:41
empirical interests

01:23:43
as already mentioned before I think the

01:23:45
the term informal has really helped to

01:23:48
move Beyond a global South versus global

01:23:50
North studies on cities and to really

01:23:53
look at the informal urbanism AS Global

01:23:55
urbanism where the informal in a way has

01:23:57
become foundational to our understanding

01:23:59
of cities at Large

01:24:01
uh and the last point I'll skip uh for

01:24:04
now is less essential

01:24:06
okay I need a sip of water

01:24:09
um questions please or or comments or

01:24:12
additions uh on this on this part

01:24:18
if any

01:24:25
um maybe I could ask a question about

01:24:27
um let's say these structures these

01:24:30
infrastructures growing in the shadow of

01:24:31
the state as you have mentioned it so we

01:24:34
noticed that

01:24:35
um actually a lot of communes in

01:24:37
Brussels are trying to set themselves on

01:24:40
the let's say cultural map and we are

01:24:44
working in urban analysis on the

01:24:45
community Forge that has its own like a

01:24:48
very active plan and wants to be a

01:24:50
leader and a new place for art and

01:24:52
culture in Brussels yes I wonder what

01:24:55
your take on that was also working with

01:24:58
um with the association that you

01:25:00
mentioned you must be seeing also a

01:25:02
different side of of the the influence

01:25:04
of of local yeah local government in

01:25:08
Brussels on that yeah exactly yeah

01:25:11
I mean I mean asking a question about a

01:25:14
city in which which I live of course is

01:25:15
always difficult because I can talk

01:25:17
about this for hours but

01:25:19
um

01:25:19
it's a tricky I mean I would say for

01:25:22
that to a large extent has become a a

01:25:24
creative or cultural hub for artists

01:25:27
which is really which it obviously is uh

01:25:29
despite for a municipality uh as as

01:25:33
often happens in Russell is not because

01:25:34
of the government that we see uh

01:25:37
interesting activity happening somewhere

01:25:39
Russell is a city that really relies a

01:25:42
thing on on strong let's say um uh well

01:25:46
social movements and citizen activity uh

01:25:49
and this also applies a thing to

01:25:50
Artistic activity in Forever have you

01:25:53
said that what of course what you now

01:25:54
see happening is that because for the uh

01:25:57
it has become let's see uh let's say a

01:26:00
concentration uh let's say for for

01:26:03
artists uh we do see of course that

01:26:06
local municipality is increasingly also

01:26:07
using this to in a way to to to to Brand

01:26:10
itself right to to uh as such there is

01:26:13
nothing wrong with this

01:26:14
uh I mean I don't live in Florida we

01:26:17
need to look into a very specific local

01:26:18
details at the same time I don't have

01:26:20
the feeling

01:26:21
that they have a strong strategic

01:26:25
perspective and for that on the role of

01:26:28
of arts and culture in their

01:26:30
municipality so it doesn't and that's

01:26:33
apply this applies to process as a whole

01:26:35
I think it doesn't get to my knowledge

01:26:37
move Beyond a kind of offering of

01:26:41
temporary interim use spaces for artists

01:26:44
so there doesn't yet seem to be a kind

01:26:46
of broader let's say more substantial

01:26:48
perspective on this but maybe you

01:26:50
already know more about this through the

01:26:51
urban analysis and and the work that

01:26:53
you've done so far

01:26:56
I think we we definitely see a lot of

01:26:59
policy claims for sure and a lot of use

01:27:02
of it

01:27:03
um so now indeed it's a next challenge

01:27:05
to look into how that actually plays out

01:27:07
on the ground and whether that actually

01:27:10
translates into action but thank you for

01:27:11
your reaction yes okay thank you

01:27:14
a comment as well

01:27:17
um last year I did uh literature study

01:27:21
about gentrification in Brussels yeah

01:27:24
especially in the region of um

01:27:27
since molenberg

01:27:29
and we saw

01:27:31
um in the 80s there come a lot of

01:27:33
artists start living there

01:27:36
so it became very popular to to live

01:27:39
there and the results was poor people

01:27:42
poor people need to move out

01:27:45
so I guess there is always

01:27:48
a small dark sites of this one let's do

01:27:53
gentle Creations especially in in

01:27:55
Brussels yeah yeah I mean I can only say

01:27:58
I showed yes to that

01:28:01
um yeah I mean I mean I mean there's

01:28:04
there are different opinions on

01:28:05
gentrification and Brussels I mean some

01:28:07
would say well there's clear

01:28:09
gentrification and B and there's there's

01:28:11
expulsion

01:28:13
um

01:28:14
if you look at the numbers that my the

01:28:16
actual expulsion of people from a

01:28:18
certain localities might be limited

01:28:19
still but it's clear that certain

01:28:21
certain areas are changing rapidly

01:28:24
um one of the things we're trying to do

01:28:25
which for example the permanent project

01:28:26
I'm permanent project I mentioned is to

01:28:29
also think about spatial because one of

01:28:30
the problems is let's say artists move

01:28:32
into certain spaces they're looking for

01:28:35
let's say work and Living Spaces but in

01:28:37
a way unintendedly so data and actually

01:28:40
lead to a push out effect for other uh

01:28:42
for adolescent poor poor citizens in

01:28:45
most cases

01:28:46
at the same time it's not as if artists

01:28:48
are belong let's say to an urban Elite

01:28:50
in general

01:28:51
so one is on a very small level what

01:28:54
we're trying to do with the permanent

01:28:55
project is also try to think of let's

01:28:57
say spaces that are that are co-owned

01:29:00
and where let's say the the move of

01:29:03
artists into a certain area does not

01:29:05
automatically translate into the move

01:29:07
out of other citizens uh

01:29:11
realistically speaking of course my

01:29:13
position on this is that

01:29:15
this can only partially be solved on the

01:29:17
project level because practically

01:29:19
speaking you simply need more social

01:29:21
housing for this and muscles is is a

01:29:24
disastrous City when it comes to

01:29:25
percentage of social housing let alone

01:29:27
qualitative social housing we're really

01:29:30
talking about a few percentages

01:29:31
uh of the total housing stock which is

01:29:35
social housing which is completely

01:29:37
different for example in a city such as

01:29:38
such as Amsterdam which has also seen

01:29:40
gentrification obviously but that's the

01:29:42
social housing stock definitely helps

01:29:44
there which all is all is its own

01:29:47
complexities and problems so yeah

01:29:53
any other comments

01:29:57
no okay then I'll move to the like the

01:30:01
last section I think of the

01:30:04
of the the the session I think we're

01:30:06
more or less okay on time

01:30:08
which is good so I I what I did I

01:30:10
promised last week that I would also

01:30:12
have a separate section on tourism I

01:30:14
don't so I didn't manage to fit it in

01:30:16
and uh it's it's picked up in some of

01:30:19
these elements implicitly I think so

01:30:21
um I'm also less of an expert on Urban

01:30:23
tourism I know the literature quite well

01:30:24
but it's not something that I do

01:30:26
research on myself uh but this is

01:30:28
certainly also a let's see another

01:30:30
strand of research which would be is

01:30:32
interesting from an urban cultural

01:30:33
perspective

01:30:35
however the last strand I want to

01:30:37
discuss with you today is is literature

01:30:39
which is perhaps more closely related to

01:30:41
the humanities than some other elements

01:30:43
I that I that I discussed with you today

01:30:46
um which I flag here as the research on

01:30:49
sensory urbanism visual cultures or

01:30:51
sensory urbanism and then two examples

01:30:53
visual cultures and sounds

01:30:56
um the Brian largest text that was on

01:30:58
your reading for today already

01:30:59
highlighted I think how media

01:31:01
Technologies and Aesthetics shape Urban

01:31:04
places so this idea that actually by

01:31:06
building certain distribution

01:31:07
infrastructures by having certain places

01:31:09
you actually shape Urban places through

01:31:12
through these Technologies and

01:31:13
Aesthetics in turn and this you could

01:31:16
see is let's say the more experiential

01:31:18
phenomenological or or user point of

01:31:20
view this implies also that places are

01:31:23
experienced through multiple senses

01:31:25
seeing listening smelling touching

01:31:27
tasting now historically most research

01:31:30
has focused on the visual Dimension but

01:31:32
increasingly we also see it and this has

01:31:34
a long long history I'll give a few

01:31:36
simple examples in a minute

01:31:38
but increasingly you also see the

01:31:39
attention paid to other sciences and

01:31:42
I'll briefly discuss tourists to

01:31:43
research which I think is pretty

01:31:45
interesting but obviously I'm biased

01:31:47
because I I tend to like mostly or Focus

01:31:50
mostly on on Music and Sound myself

01:31:53
um but I'll briefly discuss uh some of

01:31:56
the research on let's see auditory

01:31:57
culture Sonic cultures or Music and

01:32:00
Sound

01:32:02
now to start with the visual ecology

01:32:05
spots so remember Jameson so this is

01:32:07
let's say the the the hotel that was

01:32:09
already discussed uh in the in the

01:32:12
Jameson text 1984. basically you could

01:32:15
say one element of if not star

01:32:16
architecture but at least let's see very

01:32:18
sort of in your face uh phase

01:32:21
architecture and within Urban studies a

01:32:23
lot of attention has been paid to this

01:32:25
kind of architecture so basically

01:32:27
buildings designed to leave a strong

01:32:29
visual impression because that is what

01:32:31
these buildings do and what they aim to

01:32:32
do now the analytical Focus starting

01:32:35
already in the 1980s some elements have

01:32:38
let's say survived the years others have

01:32:40
not has been on cognitive disorientation

01:32:42
but also on Landmark statements in a

01:32:45
city with an emphasis on spectacle and

01:32:47
surveillance with emphasis and

01:32:49
consumption Landscapes and an emphasis

01:32:51
on representation and Global

01:32:53
attractiveness so this is all you see

01:32:55
well rehearsed territory within Urban

01:32:58
studies and which has a long history of

01:33:01
of analysis now star architecture you

01:33:04
literally adds value to world cities or

01:33:08
aspiring world cities so the

01:33:10
architecture becomes you could say an

01:33:12
urban icon in global rankings it really

01:33:15
helps and years there is a tourism

01:33:16
reference it really helps to put world

01:33:19
cities on the map for tourism and

01:33:21
consumption purposes

01:33:22
uh these sites or or the surrounding

01:33:25
areas become size for business

01:33:26
Investments uh or also for up Market

01:33:29
residential housing so they literally

01:33:31
add value to aspiring the world cities

01:33:34
true you could say strong visual claims

01:33:38
now this has this of course has a

01:33:40
history right this is not we have we

01:33:42
should not be naiveless historically a

01:33:44
leaf and pretend that this is something

01:33:46
of let's say the post for this age or

01:33:49
something that we've only seen since the

01:33:50
late 20th century although it probably

01:33:52
has increased and probably let's say

01:33:56
more let's say professional and

01:33:58
strategic attention is now being paid a

01:34:01
paid to let's say the visual dimension

01:34:02
of cities compared to the let's say the

01:34:05
the

01:34:06
the decades before but it has a much

01:34:09
longer history the most and most obvious

01:34:11
or let's say a classic example of course

01:34:12
being the Eiffel Tower which itself was

01:34:15
built to put Paris on the map or to make

01:34:18
it more visual Again part of let's say a

01:34:21
broader broader exhibition setup you

01:34:23
know originally intended temporary but

01:34:25
has been there for quite some time and

01:34:27
which now is a classic Landmark case in

01:34:30
uh or example in oops sorry

01:34:34
around the world when people think about

01:34:36
Paris sorry

01:34:40
or another example

01:34:42
um

01:34:43
so I'm working with two two computers

01:34:45
here so this is sometimes confusing uh

01:34:48
another example the Opera housing City

01:34:50
again an example even if you've never

01:34:52
visited Sydney you will know this

01:34:54
building the Opera House in Sydney

01:34:56
architect you're on utsan uh or another

01:34:59
example which I think by now also

01:35:01
everyone knows which is perhaps you in a

01:35:03
way the more recent example the gubernet

01:35:05
museum in Bilbao Spain which in its very

01:35:09
setup uh was intended to leave Legacy a

01:35:14
visual impression and you will see that

01:35:16
many people visit the Google night

01:35:18
Museum in Bilbao without seeing anything

01:35:20
else or any or very little of Bilbao as

01:35:23
such so I would I would dare to to claim

01:35:26
that the vast majority of people that

01:35:28
visit the Google Museum in Bilbao will

01:35:31
leave the city Without Really knowing

01:35:33
much about Bilbao yeah I mean there's

01:35:36
not a question if they should be it

01:35:37
should but it's clear that this kind of

01:35:39
a visual attraction plays a key role and

01:35:42
it has played out at the same time in

01:35:43
almost role in increasing tourism flows

01:35:46
towards Bilbao

01:35:48
or an even more recent Example The

01:35:50
Helpful Harmony the Opera House in

01:35:54
Hamburg uh 800 million euros enormously

01:35:58
over budget which is very typical also

01:36:00
for some a lot of the star architecture

01:36:03
but in general though and not

01:36:05
surprisingly perhaps also is that many

01:36:06
of these buildings are cultural

01:36:08
landmarks that both offer you could say

01:36:10
culture and a design space for tourism

01:36:12
and consumption yeah

01:36:15
so this as I said this is well rehearsed

01:36:17
territory still a lot of interesting

01:36:18
research is being done on this but it's

01:36:20
it's quite established in in the base

01:36:24
I'll give some examples of course that

01:36:26
leads to all kinds of discussions also

01:36:28
about

01:36:29
um who has the biggest tower I won't go

01:36:31
into sort of the masculine connotations

01:36:32
of building the world's tall tallest

01:36:35
building but it's quite obvious here uh

01:36:37
the Burj Khalifa and also I think and

01:36:40
this is perhaps a shift which is newer

01:36:42
uh although and also not completely new

01:36:45
is that especially unless the world

01:36:47
global cities such as New York such as

01:36:49
London we see a lot of intention being

01:36:51
paid by private developers to very

01:36:53
up-market elite residential housing yeah

01:36:56
so this is height one uh in in London

01:36:59
for example

01:37:03
it is interesting also because these

01:37:05
there's some of these space for up

01:37:06
Market residential housing they are

01:37:08
built to leave a visual impact they are

01:37:10
built to attract buyers multi buyers but

01:37:13
let's say the running joke in a way or

01:37:15
low the sadness of the story in many

01:37:16
ways is that if you look at uh how well

01:37:20
for which period of the Year these are

01:37:22
Partners or builds are actually occupied

01:37:24
by actual actual inhabitants is often

01:37:27
quite limited some of these are just

01:37:28
Apartments to park uh to park like money

01:37:31
but not Nest or do laundry money but not

01:37:34
necessary to actually live there for for

01:37:36
a sustainers well substantial period of

01:37:39
the year

01:37:41
foreign

01:37:43
or another example in New York for 423

01:37:47
Park Avenue

01:37:49
um perhaps less spectacular but maybe

01:37:51
intend in a similar Direction at least

01:37:53
visually speaking uh is this building at

01:37:56
the in the Canal Zone the upside Tower

01:37:59
in Brussels but the prices are certainly

01:38:01
more affordable than what the price you

01:38:03
will see in uh in New York or London

01:38:07
now what's interesting about this this

01:38:09
visual cultures especially in sort of

01:38:11
New Media times is that these let's say

01:38:14
these Landmark statements these are

01:38:16
actual buildings these are buildings

01:38:17
very much let's say uh very costly

01:38:20
investments in urban space uh but the

01:38:24
vast majority of people will know these

01:38:25
buildings they will see these buildings

01:38:27
through social media and online

01:38:29
magazines or maybe the let's say a

01:38:31
coffee table book magazines yeah so

01:38:34
these these buildings play a massive an

01:38:36
important role in City branding and

01:38:38
hopefully attracting cultural tourism

01:38:40
and also in circulating on social media

01:38:42
so you've got images such as this where

01:38:44
sort of if you look at Instagram and

01:38:46
search for Star architecture or

01:38:48
spectacular architecture you will see

01:38:50
loads of images or even let's say New

01:38:53
York using using uh using let's say

01:38:57
certain space or new builds in New York

01:38:59
and labeling it as best Instagram spots

01:39:01
and then you get these uh this

01:39:03
interesting uh let's say tourism

01:39:05
basically photograph themselves with the

01:39:07
building in the background as a candles

01:39:09
let's say

01:39:10
uh I've been there kind of attitudes but

01:39:13
it's quite obvious where sort of the the

01:39:15
spectacular Arctic plays a key role not

01:39:17
in relation to questions actual use but

01:39:19
largely in regression in relation to

01:39:21
questions of representation and how can

01:39:23
you actually uh how do how well do these

01:39:25
images look like on Instagram or other

01:39:28
websites

01:39:33
now this is empirically this is

01:39:35
interesting he's a new phenomena with

01:39:38
longer histories but empirically

01:39:39
interesting theoretically it raises

01:39:41
certain questions about how we should

01:39:43
look like how we should look at at city

01:39:46
development and how we should look at

01:39:48
how cities uh change over time this ties

01:39:51
then I would argue with a literature on

01:39:53
what is sometimes called geographies of

01:39:54
circulation where we really try to

01:39:57
understand City cultures as an effect of

01:39:59
circulation so not necessarily designed

01:40:01
locally but actually images traveling

01:40:03
between cities of course also traveling

01:40:06
of Architects and other experts but also

01:40:08
Concepts images plans best practices so

01:40:11
my Urban culture as such perhaps also

01:40:13
Urban policy as such becomes a kind of

01:40:15
practice of inter-inter referencing so

01:40:18
cities referencing each other or

01:40:20
buildings referencing each other to to

01:40:22
to to to to stake out a claim so to

01:40:25
speak

01:40:25
now all this leaves back in my view

01:40:28
although not always recognized as such

01:40:30
with the Innovative nervous studies do

01:40:32
classic cultural studies concerns with

01:40:33
the politics of representation but also

01:40:36
to an anthropological interest and

01:40:38
there's a very nice book an article also

01:40:40
by Ayana already from the late 1980s on

01:40:43
the social life of objects so how do

01:40:45
objects travel through space and Through

01:40:49
Time

01:40:51
okay

01:40:54
last section for today because this as I

01:40:57
said is it's well well throttling Theory

01:40:58
within Urban studies to really look at

01:41:00
sort of the visual in relation to to the

01:41:03
urban

01:41:04
but especially uh yeah the last 10 20

01:41:07
years I guess we see an increasing

01:41:08
interest also in other sciences and the

01:41:10
urban the example I briefly want to

01:41:12
discuss with you today as a closure for

01:41:14
the lecture uh isn't it is um research

01:41:17
and auditory Sonic cultures the

01:41:19
vocabulary tends to differ

01:41:21
um there's a lot of interesting work

01:41:23
being done on this still sometimes also

01:41:26
by practicing uh practicing artists

01:41:28
practicing musicians that also writes

01:41:30
such as for example Brandon LaBelle who

01:41:32
wrote quite a nice book on acoustic

01:41:34
territories sound culture and everyday

01:41:36
life so you see again everyday life

01:41:38
returning as a as a as vocabulary so in

01:41:43
chapter 3 for example which is the some

01:41:45
of the examples I use here where you

01:41:47
explicitly bills on micheliness of those

01:41:49
the practice of everyday life a very

01:41:51
develop the view on walking not an in a

01:41:55
visual way as actually the setode did

01:41:57
because he had a lot of discussions to

01:41:58
do about how you look in relation to

01:42:00
building how you position yourself in

01:42:01
relation to the city but a very develops

01:42:04
with you and walk through an auditory or

01:42:06
rhythmic perspectives and then he gives

01:42:09
all kinds of examples such as crosswalk

01:42:10
signals warning warning alarms or

01:42:13
personal audio so looking listening on

01:42:15
your smartphone to music while walking

01:42:16
through the city but also for example

01:42:18
sound art or marching bands or protests

01:42:21
and they're all sound plays and let's

01:42:23
say experiencing and and structuring uh

01:42:26
let's say city city life

01:42:30
he gives the example for example of

01:42:32
floriano jumano and fallante Sao Paulo I

01:42:35
think he actually mentions as Rio

01:42:36
dictionary but I think it's in Sao Paulo

01:42:39
um we walked around uh with with a big

01:42:42
speaker on us on his back uh which

01:42:46
basically

01:42:47
um where the voice is speaking out loud

01:42:50
don't don't something like don't pay

01:42:52
attention if I remember correctly so he

01:42:54
was walking around the streets in public

01:42:56
space don't pay attention don't pay

01:42:58
attention don't pay attention which

01:43:00
obviously the exact opposite will then

01:43:02
happen which is a pretty nice or neat uh

01:43:06
intervention I think in in public space

01:43:08
as a kind of art project

01:43:12
another example is okay is that that we

01:43:14
have active networks this is a much

01:43:16
longer history also of field recorders

01:43:18
people doing field recordings but

01:43:20
there's a very nice website for those

01:43:22
that are that are into this stuff uh

01:43:24
which uh it's called sound cities just

01:43:26
Google it you'll find it which has

01:43:29
connected let's say field records from

01:43:31
cities across the world where you can

01:43:33
actually play well this has been mapped

01:43:35
literally on the map of these cities and

01:43:37
where you can play Let's see sounds from

01:43:39
these cities or from these particular

01:43:40
locations in these cities uh and that's

01:43:43
that's an ever-growing database but

01:43:45
there's also active community of sound

01:43:47
recorders field recorders recording

01:43:49
sounds are cities and it's quite nice if

01:43:51
you have a bit of time to let's say to

01:43:54
go through some of the sounds and also

01:43:55
experience some of the let's say

01:43:57
differences and sounds uh between

01:43:59
between different cities

01:44:03
one example I want to just briefly play

01:44:06
and I hope this all works with uh with

01:44:08
sounds I'm just going to play it and

01:44:09
then you're gonna have to tell me if you

01:44:10
hear the sound so turn on do turn on the

01:44:12
sounds uh is a very nice piece I think

01:44:15
by Felix bloom a Mexican artist simaphor

01:44:17
was so normal from Mexico City 2015.

01:44:20
very

01:44:22
um basically manipulated the walking

01:44:25
signals uh of

01:44:27
um on the street in um

01:44:30
uh in Mexico City and when we replace

01:44:32
the sound of a pedestrian traffic light

01:44:34
with the sound uh with like let's say

01:44:36
the classic sound with the sound of a

01:44:38
donkey uh which according to him is a

01:44:41
nice way of of well paying attention to

01:44:43
well first of all making people think

01:44:46
differently look differently wait this

01:44:48
is something else than I expected so

01:44:49
it's a kind of intervention but also a

01:44:51
bit directing attention to an animal

01:44:53
which is largely disappeared from Mexico

01:44:55
City uh says this Urban space which uh

01:44:58
which uh was different let's say 30 40

01:45:01
50 years ago so I'm just gonna look if

01:45:03
this works and you're gonna have to tell

01:45:04
me just do it like this or something if

01:45:07
the sound is okay

01:45:13
do you hear sounds

01:45:15
okay perfect now please play

01:45:41
[Music]

01:45:55
[Music]

01:46:05
foreign

01:46:17
[Music]

01:46:30
okay so just one one small example which

01:46:33
I thought is a pretty pretty nice

01:46:36
um

01:46:37
nice intervention with a lot of humor uh

01:46:40
Felix Bloom also did quite he's done a

01:46:42
lot of work as a sound artist he also

01:46:43
did quite some interesting work and this

01:46:45
is a kind of early work you could argue

01:46:47
but where later on he actually worked in

01:46:50
collaboration with blind people uh to

01:46:52
actually and and use let's say sounds

01:46:54
and their experience of urban space in

01:46:57
order to sort of make make artistic uh

01:46:59
well it's artistic projects which is

01:47:00
also some interesting work to just check

01:47:02
his website if you're interested in this

01:47:04
kind of stuff

01:47:07
this example I'll move to the very end

01:47:09
which is a nice example by the way of

01:47:12
of sound and protests and there are many

01:47:14
examples of this following the 2011

01:47:17
Fukushima Fukushima nuclear accident in

01:47:20
Japan Japan saw actually a wide range of

01:47:24
public protests here's one example which

01:47:27
was a sound demo organized by a loose

01:47:31
association called shirota noiran

01:47:33
amateur revolt

01:47:34
and the organized a kind of sound demo

01:47:37
protest which is pretty neat if you like

01:47:39
noise which I do but since it's a 10

01:47:41
minute video I will

01:47:43
leave this for the very end and close my

01:47:48
sorry that one that will come in a

01:47:50
second

01:47:51
and move to my conclusions

01:47:53
before I do so are there any questions

01:47:55
on the um on the section on sensory

01:47:59
urbanism

01:48:04
and I know it's almost 8 PM so I know

01:48:06
it's late

01:48:08
yeah just just unmute yourself and start

01:48:10
talking because I don't see anyone

01:48:11
everyone in my screen okay I would just

01:48:13
like to share with with you and with

01:48:16
whom can be interested about the project

01:48:19
of um sound of tourist tourism

01:48:23
Lisbon he mapped the the sound of

01:48:27
tourism in the city and it's pretty

01:48:29
interesting

01:48:31
I didn't know it yet so I'll check it

01:48:34
out very cool yeah okay thanks

01:48:37
other comments suggestions

01:48:40
interventions

01:48:42
no

01:48:44
I will wrap up then with the conclusions

01:48:46
and then after the conclusions I will

01:48:48
move to the to the Tokyo video but

01:48:51
there's obviously no obligation to sit

01:48:52
through 12 minutes of noise so I'll just

01:48:54
leave it play for those that are

01:48:56
interested uh but I will conclude uh and

01:48:59
say bye after the after the conclusions

01:49:01
okay to wrap up this uh this relatively

01:49:05
intense session I think around the

01:49:07
different strands of research on on

01:49:09
Urban culture what I tried to get across

01:49:12
is that research and urban cultures is a

01:49:14
thriving and more perhaps more

01:49:16
importantly or very all equally

01:49:18
importantly and into a transdisciplinary

01:49:19
field of research it's increasingly

01:49:21
difficult to distinguish between

01:49:23
disciplines in research and urban

01:49:25
cultures which perhaps is a trend that

01:49:28
applies to all teams you could say but I

01:49:31
definitely think it applies more

01:49:32
strongly to research and urban culture

01:49:34
building on 1980s 1990s debate on the

01:49:37
cultural term uh post-modernism and

01:49:39
urban uh and the symbolic economy and

01:49:42
through interaction with Urban

01:49:43
anthropology and cultural studies

01:49:44
particularly through Notions such as

01:49:46
informal informality informal urbanism

01:49:48
everyday life what we see is that Urban

01:49:50
studies is really Diversified into

01:49:51
multiple strands of research dedicated

01:49:53
to cultural issues it's important to

01:49:56
make distinctions here because different

01:49:58
strands have different artists have

01:50:00
different communities of practice but I

01:50:02
would say there are three different

01:50:03
strands that that that are most

01:50:06
interesting but they pretty much do

01:50:08
cover it and they're not the only

01:50:09
strands but I do think they cover uh

01:50:11
let's say 80 of of the urban studies

01:50:14
research on Urban culture perhaps with

01:50:17
the exception of urban tourism and

01:50:18
cultural issues which I didn't discuss

01:50:20
in detail today the first one being the

01:50:22
Arts activism and urban engagement the

01:50:25
second cultural infrastructure the

01:50:26
informal urbanism and the third strand

01:50:28
around sensory urbanism where I give

01:50:31
very briefly two examples on visual

01:50:34
cultures and sounds

01:50:36
that's it from my site for today

01:50:39
um if there are no further questions

01:50:41
then I will move back to the uh to this

01:50:45
presentation sorry to this video

01:50:49
um I have one quick question

01:50:52
um are there any connections between

01:50:54
um Sansui urbanism and clubbing culture

01:50:57
for instance

01:50:59
um

01:51:01
limited limited I think it's in the

01:51:03
research is limited I think the clubbing

01:51:05
culture literature as far as I know it

01:51:08
is last year literature that builds on

01:51:09
the LA City Classic cultural studies

01:51:11
tradition

01:51:12
focusing on let's say youth culture

01:51:14
popular culture uh sociological

01:51:16
approaches by and large

01:51:18
however it's if you look at let's say

01:51:21
practitioners in clubbing culture

01:51:24
then I think there are stronger

01:51:25
connections especially those working in

01:51:27
let's say electronic music moving let's

01:51:31
say from a minimal techno orientation

01:51:33
who have increasingly moved into let's

01:51:35
say modern composition and or indeed

01:51:39
field work type Fields field recordings

01:51:41
type of work there you will see

01:51:44
um

01:51:45
artist who

01:51:47
um well who who sort of transcend the

01:51:50
boundaries who connect these things

01:51:51
because they then become you could say

01:51:53
sensory urbanists through their practice

01:51:55
but in the research I would say less so

01:51:58
they think they seem to be quite

01:51:59
separate well they are to a large extent

01:52:01
quite separate fields

01:52:03
but which doesn't mean that the

01:52:05
connection cannot be made so that may be

01:52:06
done your job yeah

01:52:09
well I'm thinking uh

01:52:12
I have one example in mind

01:52:15
um of Tbilisi in Georgia

01:52:18
where last year there were very big

01:52:21
protests I have to say I really don't

01:52:23
know the details about it but I know

01:52:25
there was also

01:52:26
uh some substantial mobilization from uh

01:52:32
clubs and from people from artists and

01:52:36
people from that scene um

01:52:39
and you saw some sort of a collaboration

01:52:42
between

01:52:44
yeah these these people from club

01:52:46
culture so to say and more political

01:52:48
movements and also using music in public

01:52:51
space as a form of protest yeah no that

01:52:54
that happens of course and I think in in

01:52:56
the Berlin example I used before I think

01:52:58
you also see these examples of public

01:52:59
protest and uh and music I mean the the

01:53:03
classic example of the love love parade

01:53:05
started out you could say as a political

01:53:07
movement even though I would argue it's

01:53:09
that it was heavily commodified soon

01:53:11
after or increasingly so

01:53:14
um but the sensory urbanism literature

01:53:16
perhaps relates more you could say to

01:53:18
the experimental sites and to the sound

01:53:20
not not even necessarily music and

01:53:22
that's a different kind of scene I would

01:53:24
argue and although there is overlap

01:53:26
obviously so yeah

01:53:28
yeah thank you any other comments

01:53:32
questions

01:53:33
perhaps just a very practical question

01:53:35
uh for me regarding the seminars that

01:53:38
will follow uh in the coming weeks and I

01:53:41
wonder how

01:53:42
um the presentations will will go

01:53:46
I asked because we were asked in the

01:53:48
past to record the video of our

01:53:49
presentation and I wondered if you

01:53:51
wanted the same or if we will give that

01:53:53
in person yes the rule would be would

01:53:55
remain the same I think that's how it's

01:53:56
the most communicated also so I would

01:53:57
actually need to look into the details

01:53:59
myself because I've been busy with with

01:54:00
the lectures so far but the idea would

01:54:03
still be that

01:54:04
the recordings are well are recorded in

01:54:08
advance and then we have and use and use

01:54:11
email it to me or you and and we

01:54:13
presented yes

01:54:15
thank you so much

01:54:17
sorry okay yeah okay

01:54:21
then I will move to the presentation but

01:54:23
it's 8 P.M so this is just when I say

01:54:25
the hardcore survivors who

01:54:28
want to stick stick around for a bit

01:54:30
longer

01:54:31
um I'm gonna say goodbye in any case I

01:54:33
will also look at it again so you can

01:54:36
still chat if you want to uh and then

01:54:39
thank you for your attention and I will

01:54:41
see well I think every one of you next

01:54:43
week during the during the seminars all

01:54:46

# 8 Transport and cities: a historical hegemony

00:00:41
hello it seems that

00:00:44
we are beginning to uh

00:00:47
to join this lecture today I hope you

00:00:50
can hear me

00:00:51
we're starting in four minutes but I

00:00:53
still would like to make sure that

00:00:55
everything is working here so if you're

00:00:58
not hearing me let me

00:01:00
know in the chat or over here but I

00:01:02
think

00:01:03
seems to be working

00:01:06
foreign

00:03:46
just to check can you all hear me and

00:03:49
see me

00:03:51
um it's a funny question to us these

00:03:53
days but

00:03:54
yes we can great very good thank you

00:03:58
fantastic I'm happy that we not running

00:04:01
into technical troubles right away

00:04:04
um let's start with five past to uh to

00:04:08
give everybody enough time to join us

00:04:13
um

00:04:14
so grab a grab a drink a tea or coffee

00:04:18
or whatever it is that you like to drink

00:04:20
at this time of the day and uh

00:04:22
and let's try to make this as pleasant

00:04:24
and experience as possible so five more

00:04:27
minutes I'm gonna switch up the video

00:04:29
for a moment and join you then

00:07:01
foreign

00:07:17
oh yeah please tell us or tell me in the

00:07:20
chat

00:07:22
um which I have open here just in case

00:07:25
welcome all of you

00:07:28
um I'm sure that you've had that so many

00:07:30
times already I really wish we could

00:07:32
meet face to face in a in an actual

00:07:34
lecture room at Pub

00:07:36
um but uh I'm still happy that we're

00:07:39
doing it in any case in this very

00:07:41
unusual or maybe for you actually

00:07:43
already a very normal format by now who

00:07:46
am I you might be wondering my name is

00:07:49
I am a postdoctoral researcher here at

00:07:52
vub

00:07:54
and I'm the last of the four white males

00:07:56
to tell you everything about urban

00:07:58
geography so uh I come last but I hope

00:08:02
um this was not been a very tiring

00:08:05
course by now and you still have the

00:08:06
energy and then will to to follow

00:08:10
um over the course of the next two

00:08:12
lectures two sessions I will be sharing

00:08:15
with you my perspective my ideas about

00:08:19
Urban transport and Mobility

00:08:22
um well it's a lecture so it's very

00:08:25
difficult to make it highly interactive

00:08:27
but I will still try to ask you some

00:08:29
questions and

00:08:31
um I think I hope it's possible for you

00:08:33
to try to respond to them not only

00:08:37
through chat but basically you know turn

00:08:39
the audio on video and

00:08:41
um I don't think it will be a

00:08:42
conversation but at least it would be

00:08:44
nice to hear some other voices not only

00:08:45
mine for two hours and then two hours

00:08:48
again and of course this is followed by

00:08:50
a discussion seminar so you will have

00:08:53
read or you have read already some

00:08:54
articles and I hope we will have a

00:08:56
discussion there

00:08:58
um so that we we can make this whole

00:09:00
thing a little bit more interactive than

00:09:03
um then it is usually the case through

00:09:05
these uh online online courses

00:09:08
right

00:09:10
um I hope you can also see the slides

00:09:12
can you not those of you who have the

00:09:14
video on

00:09:15
do you see them perfect very good so

00:09:18
um excellent so Urban transported

00:09:21
Mobility it is uh if you have any

00:09:23
questions concerning the content or I

00:09:25
don't know the quality of uh video audio

00:09:27
let me know in the chat I'll try to read

00:09:31
this as I as I talk

00:09:33
multitasking and try to interrupt me if

00:09:37
you yeah if you have any you know

00:09:39
questions if you disagree if you if you

00:09:41
have some burning issue let me know or

00:09:43
let us know and then I'll try to stop

00:09:46
and address that all right great so what

00:09:49
is the plan for the next two sessions

00:09:52
today we're going to talk about a

00:09:54
historical hegemony of two different

00:09:57
main sets of approaches to Urban

00:09:59
Geography of transport and next week

00:10:02
we're going to try to deconstruct all

00:10:04
that to address this in a critical

00:10:05
manner and to understand how to look at

00:10:08
Urban transport immobility from a

00:10:10
critical set of perspectives

00:10:12
so without further Ado today we're going

00:10:15
to start with a bit of a historical

00:10:18
overview of the relationship between

00:10:19
transport and the city uh how this

00:10:22
relationship evolved in

00:10:24
these two directions

00:10:25
and discuss as much as possible as much

00:10:28
as time will allow us to this historical

00:10:31
hegemony of two main sets of approaches

00:10:33
on Urban transport and geography so

00:10:36
neoclassical and sustainable

00:10:37
perspectives of urban transport

00:10:41
but before we begin

00:10:44
um I'm really curious about what your

00:10:45
expectations might be I imagine that a

00:10:48
lot of you when you know starting a

00:10:50
course of urban studies or geography

00:10:53
didn't really expect to study transport

00:10:55
why would the transport be important for

00:10:58
understanding cities and their geography

00:11:00
what do you think would any like anybody

00:11:03
like to say something or type it in the

00:11:06
chat that's the moment we're going to

00:11:08
have a few of these open questions

00:11:10
throughout these four hours together

00:11:12
why study transport when studying cities

00:11:14
why why is that important or not

00:11:19
um I I did actually expect transport to

00:11:21
be part of the the study because to me

00:11:24
at least

00:11:25
um it Alters the way the city is

00:11:27
structured sometimes it's structured

00:11:29
around a specific mode of Transport

00:11:32
um like there's differences between

00:11:34
um

00:11:36
um what they call like Harbor cities or

00:11:38
cities more in the middle of land

00:11:39
something and I think it makes a big

00:11:41
difference with how with a geographic

00:11:44
development so to me it's actually I

00:11:47
think it's it's a key factor right so it

00:11:50
would have some impact on the urban

00:11:51
Forum on on so it's spatial arrangement

00:11:54
of the city why else

00:11:57
there are many reasons as you can

00:11:58
imagine but what comes to your mind

00:12:02
I think it also like Matilda already

00:12:05
mentioned before uh one main aspect is

00:12:09
sustainability and cities how to like uh

00:12:14
to to reach the climate goals so okay

00:12:18
it's yeah linked to different

00:12:22
transportation systems or so to think of

00:12:26
let's say environmental impact of of

00:12:29
cities and transport being a big part of

00:12:31
that

00:12:33
um possibly or being part of the the

00:12:37
problem right so generating emissions

00:12:39
CO2 and other gases that yeah

00:12:43
contribute to the climate crisis all

00:12:46
right what else

00:12:48
I think something has to do with job

00:12:51
opportunities

00:12:53
for example in Lagos in Nigeria

00:12:56
we see people moving for hours

00:13:00
um go to town to to look for a job and

00:13:04
go back again so eight hours they're

00:13:06
spending in in casual right right so

00:13:09
transport is well without transport it's

00:13:11
difficult to get around the city and and

00:13:14
use its different functions and uh

00:13:17
use different opportunities that the

00:13:19
city might provide like employment

00:13:21
education Leisure many other things all

00:13:25
right

00:13:25
any last point before we move on does

00:13:29
somebody have a great idea to add this

00:13:31
little discussion

00:13:34
well okay well I think today yes it's

00:13:41
quite

00:13:43
um actually is this slide a little bit

00:13:45
cut or do you see it yeah I think this

00:13:46
will be better now so today when you

00:13:49
open the news I think it's difficult to

00:13:51
not to notice that transport is well

00:13:54
very present I would say in the in the

00:13:56
public debate last year I'm just taking

00:14:00
a few examples here last year you

00:14:02
probably

00:14:03
um read about or maybe even participated

00:14:05
in a witnessed huge protests that

00:14:07
erupted in Chile studying in the capital

00:14:10
of the country which of course

00:14:12
very much addressed uh

00:14:15
um fundamental structural issues in

00:14:17
terms of how capitalism develops in this

00:14:19
in this country and how it has its Urban

00:14:22
or spatial impact but the beginning of

00:14:25
the protest was so the final you know

00:14:27
dropped that actually led to the

00:14:29
eruption of those and all those strikes

00:14:31
in these uprisings was the increase of

00:14:33
public transport first and specifically

00:14:36
the underground phase

00:14:38
in Brussels that's the top right corner

00:14:40
we've in the past years we've witnessed

00:14:43
a series of protests in public space

00:14:44
that address uh the increased presence

00:14:47
of the car which supposedly these

00:14:49
protests claim takes space from the from

00:14:52
the people so decrease the quality of

00:14:54
our life

00:14:56
um negatively impact the the quality of

00:15:00
um quality of every living health

00:15:02
conditions especially of of children and

00:15:05
then the figure in the top left I'm sure

00:15:07
that you all know Greta

00:15:09
uh who refers to transport of course she

00:15:12
doesn't talk only about the transport

00:15:13
boy when she does when she makes this

00:15:15
very political statement of not

00:15:17
traveling by plane and using only trains

00:15:19
to go to her meetings or or

00:15:22
conferences at least before copied she

00:15:25
did the idea there is to to show us that

00:15:28
there isn't a necessity for us to engage

00:15:30
in some social and environmental

00:15:32
transition and transport is part of this

00:15:34
transition so the way that we've moved

00:15:36
around the way that we've lived is

00:15:38
essentially unsustainable it's

00:15:40
detrimental from the environmental point

00:15:41
of view we need to change that radically

00:15:43
uh meaning in a very drastic way so

00:15:48
really

00:15:50
um

00:15:51
in a very profound way but also in terms

00:15:53
of speed of that change in order to

00:15:55
address what shared and devices the main

00:15:57
issue today the main problem today which

00:15:58
is the climate crisis or the climate

00:16:00
catastrophe that is that is imminent

00:16:03
it's I think easy to yeah just by

00:16:05
following the news to realize that well

00:16:07
something is profoundly wrong with with

00:16:09
uh with the way that we are Mobile today

00:16:10
and that has to change and indeed the

00:16:14
industry or those who are the the key

00:16:17
actors in terms of producing transport

00:16:19
is there to of course respond with some

00:16:22
solutions at least so we're being told

00:16:24
that at least one of the solutions or

00:16:26
one of the series of solutions that are

00:16:28
that are available are those of

00:16:29
platform-based economies of shared

00:16:31
digitalized smart Giga economy related

00:16:35
Mobility or mobilities so we for

00:16:38
instance in the future uh living in the

00:16:42
city we don't have to have a car as we

00:16:44
know detrimental to human environment we

00:16:46
can rent one through an app we can drive

00:16:49
electric cars which are readily

00:16:50
available in public space in our cities

00:16:52
we can use one of these electric

00:16:53
scooters and many other modes of

00:16:55
Transport that have boomed in recent

00:16:58
years in in many many cities of the

00:17:00
flogo north especially but also Global

00:17:02
South and Brussels uh I'm sure those of

00:17:05
you who are from the city who have been

00:17:07
there for a couple of months now

00:17:09
you know you can observe many of these

00:17:11
different practices of Mobility very

00:17:13
present in the city and some of them at

00:17:15
least

00:17:16
um being part of a narrative of of some

00:17:19
change of some future of something that

00:17:21
is shaping the way that we that we live

00:17:23
and move around the city

00:17:26
from a more scientific perspective one

00:17:29
answer why to the question why study

00:17:32
transport is that quite simply and this

00:17:35
is I think actually the very first

00:17:36
sentence of one of the most seminal uh

00:17:39
textbooks on German of Transport

00:17:41
geography there wouldn't be no

00:17:43
Transportation without geography and

00:17:44
there will be no Transportation no

00:17:46
church free without transportation and

00:17:48
transport of Transportation in North

00:17:51
America

00:17:52
um is an essentially geographical issue

00:17:54
the idea is and again it's the same

00:17:56
textbook the transport allows to reduce

00:17:59
the distance to zero of course that

00:18:01
reduction never really happens but the

00:18:03
idea is the transport allows to

00:18:05
manipulate space and time that is

00:18:07
required to to conquer to cover that

00:18:10
space

00:18:12
and I think beyond that very dry

00:18:15
definition of the relationship between

00:18:17
the two what's quite important is that

00:18:20
well it's very hard to imagine not only

00:18:22
contemporary but also

00:18:24
pre-modern ancient societies without

00:18:26
movement without without transport it's

00:18:29
it's something that has always been

00:18:30
fundamental for for human societies for

00:18:32
human settlements and today and that's

00:18:35
something that I will try to show you in

00:18:36
these two two lectures and in the

00:18:38
discussion that will follow the week

00:18:40
after

00:18:41
transport is absolutely fundamental for

00:18:43
for studying the city and I think it's a

00:18:44
fascinating entry for for studying what

00:18:47
cities are today with problems might be

00:18:49
found in the not only transport problems

00:18:51
but social problems facial problems

00:18:53
economic problems related to all

00:18:55
different challenges that at first at

00:18:58
least do not seem to be transport

00:19:00
related but in fact they are being

00:19:02
negotiated articulated contested soft

00:19:06
sometimes but more often unfortunately

00:19:08
created through transport through the

00:19:10
production and distribution of of

00:19:13
transport

00:19:14
so we will try to unpack this

00:19:16
relationship starting by uh let's say

00:19:18
more of a historical analysis so I'll

00:19:20
start in mid 19th century in cities in

00:19:23
western Europe uh in what we can

00:19:25
identify as a pre-industrial era

00:19:28
and we will bring that analysis to the

00:19:32
1960s 1970s let's see how much time

00:19:35
we've got uh for this today too uh well

00:19:39
let's say the beginning a major crisis

00:19:41
that formed or framed the debate in a

00:19:45
way that it is Being Framed still today

00:19:47
so some kind of a setting of a

00:19:49
contemporary challenge or series of

00:19:52
contemporary charity challenges related

00:19:54
to to transport and Mobility

00:19:56
all right

00:19:58
so

00:20:01
um

00:20:02
the main point here I don't want to

00:20:04
spend too much time on this historical

00:20:06
part because I don't think this is the

00:20:07
well it's it's not contemporary so

00:20:10
perhaps it's not as interesting as many

00:20:12
challenges that are happening right now

00:20:15
the main point here is that Urban

00:20:16
Transport Systems are are very strongly

00:20:19
and strictly related with Urban form and

00:20:21
with a spatial structure so the

00:20:23
development of cities is conditioned by

00:20:24
the development of what we call

00:20:26
transport modes from walking so just

00:20:29
walking on foot to the bicycle to public

00:20:31
transport and and to the car

00:20:35
and there is a persistently strong

00:20:36
relationship between the intra-urban

00:20:38
transportation system and the

00:20:39
organization of the Metropolis as

00:20:41
Mueller who wrote one of the most

00:20:43
seminal again textbooks on on the

00:20:46
history of Transport geography tells us

00:20:48
and there is a variety of different

00:20:50
Urban forms and spiritual structures and

00:20:52
land use patents which are related

00:20:53
specifically or very closely to the

00:20:56
development of different transport laws

00:20:58
and as far as I understand you've

00:21:01
covered quite a few of the most

00:21:03
important models of development Urban

00:21:07
Development throughout history with with

00:21:08
Nick you can not hear if that's the case

00:21:11
and or deny the fact that if you if you

00:21:15
didn't but I think that this was this

00:21:17
was covered at some point and the idea

00:21:19
here is that and a lot of these models

00:21:21
although not explicitly mentioned

00:21:24
transport was actually absolutely

00:21:25
crucial so the idea was both purchase

00:21:28
and announcer movement Mills mentioned

00:21:30
that without the development of

00:21:32
different ways of moving around the city

00:21:34
um the development which of course to an

00:21:37
extent erroneously they try to model or

00:21:39
predict would not be able to to happen

00:21:44
um well the debate has been there in the

00:21:48
in the in transport geography until the

00:21:51
1970s 1980s how to how to model that

00:21:55
relationship how to analyze it and

00:21:57
whether in fact it's it's more the

00:22:00
development of the city that drives the

00:22:02
development of transport of the other

00:22:03
Iran whether it's the development of

00:22:05
different transport modes that drive the

00:22:07
development of the city it's not a

00:22:09
particularly interesting debate today

00:22:10
but it's important to acknowledge that

00:22:12
geographers were very early on Urban

00:22:14
geographers interested in the

00:22:16
development of Mobility

00:22:18
one also rather imperfect and symbolic

00:22:21
rather than you know analytical way of

00:22:23
describing this is through identifying

00:22:26
some cycles of innovation so looking at

00:22:28
different

00:22:29
um scientific developments uh come uh

00:22:32
well some scientists would say in in

00:22:35
these kind of crucial moments and

00:22:37
there's a bundle of different

00:22:39
Innovations coming together so at the

00:22:41
end of the 19 18th century as you can

00:22:43
see at the left-hand side of the graph

00:22:45
and the invention of water power

00:22:47
textiles iron then some 60 70 years

00:22:51
later the steam engine rail production

00:22:53
of Steel etc etc each of these bundle of

00:22:57
Innovations allowing you to of course

00:23:00
create a more efficient that usually

00:23:02
meant faster and more energy efficient

00:23:04
way of moving uh of course not only

00:23:07
within but also between cities changing

00:23:10
not only the way that people move but

00:23:12
also the way that the city itself could

00:23:15
be could be organized in in space and in

00:23:19
this sense we could although of course

00:23:21
this is not a perfect you know robust

00:23:23
typology but we could

00:23:25
come into some kind of agreement you

00:23:28
don't have to accept it and I'm happy if

00:23:30
you if you raise some some issues with

00:23:32
it but we could divide the development

00:23:34
of the city around the development of

00:23:36
Transport by identifying four different

00:23:39
let's say stages I wouldn't call them

00:23:40
errors but a city that is a

00:23:42
pre-industrial city that largely was

00:23:44
based on walking uh since

00:23:47
um motorized transport was uh was

00:23:50
generally speaking not uh well it was

00:23:52
just not there and having a horse would

00:23:54
be an extremely expensive investment so

00:23:56
basically most people walked an

00:23:58
industrial city which uh developed

00:24:00
around

00:24:01
um the birth of what we could identify

00:24:04
today as public transport first horse

00:24:07
driven carts and then motorized ones

00:24:10
then the fordest city which very much

00:24:12
developed around the not only the

00:24:14
invention but rather domestification and

00:24:16
the panelization of of private vehicles

00:24:18
or private cars and then a city of today

00:24:21
the post Forest City which uh very much

00:24:24
Builds on the development of Transport

00:24:26
modes that use the ICT information and

00:24:29
information and communication

00:24:31
Technologies

00:24:33
and of course

00:24:35
um Aviation so the city does is very

00:24:38
much related also to the development of

00:24:40
of all the typology of spaces related to

00:24:42
to Flying to airplanes both passenger

00:24:46
and and cargo transport

00:24:49
are there any questions at this stage

00:24:51
before we dive into

00:24:53
these different four stages

00:24:55
I don't hear any yeah yeah go ahead

00:24:59
um

00:25:00
[Music]

00:25:02
it's linked to conductive

00:25:05
um because we saw something like that

00:25:09
with lessons of Nick

00:25:12
yeah I would say so I I think that it's

00:25:14
one of it's one of the ways of um

00:25:18
I wouldn't say that it's specific yeah

00:25:20
that it completely matches conductance

00:25:22
ways but the idea is the same uh that

00:25:24
there is some kind of development of uh

00:25:26
of innovation within the capitalist

00:25:28
system which allows to gain some

00:25:30
competitive Advantage which device

00:25:31
allows to create uh some kind of growth

00:25:35
machine and then this competitive

00:25:36
advantage over time is is uh is lost so

00:25:39
that we have a decline until it picks up

00:25:42
again what I think with chondratic is

00:25:44
still not clear is whether this new wave

00:25:46
so the one that here in this graph

00:25:48
happens after the 1990s it's very clear

00:25:51
so as far as I understand although I'm

00:25:53
not a specialist here there is a

00:25:55
discussion whether this new wave is with

00:25:57
the digitalization and software

00:26:00
engineering is actually materializing or

00:26:02
whether we've arrived at a global system

00:26:04
in which there is uh no growth of

00:26:09
um well at least within industrial

00:26:11
production it's rather a financial or

00:26:13
financialized growth

00:26:16
um but it's it's a good

00:26:19
um let's say it's a good hunch it's the

00:26:21
idea is more or less the same it's the

00:26:22
same intuition

00:26:24
also the problem with this clearly is

00:26:27
that it's not uh I mean this kind of way

00:26:30
of trying to understand what happened in

00:26:32
cities around transport in the past two

00:26:34
centuries is extremely Western uh

00:26:37
focused or very eurocentric

00:26:39
so so this would not be a story of of

00:26:43
cities in most of Latin America Africa

00:26:47
south Asia and also uh post Soviet or

00:26:50
Soviet world right so the global South

00:26:53
and the global east as it's sometimes

00:26:55
even called today it's not really part

00:26:58
of this

00:26:59
um well the story that is told by this

00:27:01
graph

00:27:03
um we will try to address this but um

00:27:05
it's yeah it's um that will happen at

00:27:08
the very end of the last of the last

00:27:10
session to try to decolonize a little

00:27:12
bit our knowledge about transport

00:27:14
geography because it's extremely

00:27:15
westernized and extremely eurocentric

00:27:19
right let's let's dive into that

00:27:22
um

00:27:23
right so the pre-industrial city right

00:27:28
um well I guess it's quite uh

00:27:30
self-explanatory it's not very difficult

00:27:32
to understand I mean the the idea is

00:27:34
that the city basically is

00:27:35
um well since there is no motorized

00:27:38
transport modes and

00:27:39
um having as I mentioned having a horse

00:27:41
or a horse car it's an it's a cost it's

00:27:44
a fortune it's an absolutely uh

00:27:46
luxurious good

00:27:49
pretty much everybody walks and since

00:27:51
everybody walks uh the city could not be

00:27:54
um cannot be too big for people to cross

00:27:56
it on foot with within more than 20 30

00:28:00
maybe 40 minutes so a traditional

00:28:03
Global northern European city would have

00:28:06
until

00:28:07
let's say end of the 18th century no

00:28:10
more than five kilometers in diameter

00:28:12
and that would mean of course here for

00:28:16
example you have a map of Brussels from

00:28:17
from that time that will mean that

00:28:20
within the city walls which existed for

00:28:22
for military purposes for defense

00:28:24
you know how to be a very high density

00:28:27
of of different functions of different

00:28:29
users

00:28:31
um and uh for other reasons that we're

00:28:34
not going to dive into today the great

00:28:36
Street pattern was also very common from

00:28:38
Middle Ages onwards also very

00:28:41
importantly since these well not maybe

00:28:43
since but as these different functions

00:28:45
were were mixed

00:28:47
um maybe this mixed city was allowed

00:28:49
partially also because of the fact that

00:28:51
the division between work at home a

00:28:53
division that is absolutely fundamental

00:28:55
for a lot of writing on transport

00:28:57
geography that focuses on that morning

00:29:00
and evening commute from home to work

00:29:03
and work from home that did not exist

00:29:04
most people worked from home most people

00:29:07
did not have to move

00:29:09
um to to reach we can say they employ

00:29:13
for the employment that they had or to

00:29:15
engage in some kind of productive

00:29:16
activity that would be renumerated to to

00:29:19
um gain some kind of salary or profit

00:29:24
things and this is all Brussels first

00:29:26
Brussels uh the map of it and then uh a

00:29:30
view of the of the city center where you

00:29:31
obviously well you basically see a lot

00:29:34
of pedestrians and uh not much else in

00:29:36
terms of in terms of Mobility modes this

00:29:38
began to change with a series of

00:29:41
inventions first a steam engine an

00:29:43
electric engine in both

00:29:46
um

00:29:46
well the invention started at the end of

00:29:49
18th century and and moved also to the

00:29:51
19th century then the bicycle

00:29:54
um I'm moving very fast here in time

00:29:56
when bicycle was invented in the

00:29:59
60s of the 19th century I think 1867

00:30:03
more or less

00:30:04
of course all these inventions first

00:30:06
being on Curiosities and again very

00:30:09
luxurious Goods bicycle being something

00:30:11
that was much more used for us as a form

00:30:13
of pleasure before eventually becoming a

00:30:16
mode of Transport for for many workers

00:30:19
all that it meant is that they gradually

00:30:22
uh led to mechanization of of land

00:30:25
Transport Systems

00:30:29
and

00:30:30
we see that gradually happening here so

00:30:35
these different inventions particularly

00:30:38
steam engine and nature also the

00:30:40
discovery and then Discovery information

00:30:43
that allow to produce electricity uh

00:30:47
meant that uh towards the end of the

00:30:50
19th century appears a completely

00:30:51
different amount of Transport which

00:30:53
revolutionized uh cities of the time

00:30:55
which is that of first a host drone

00:30:58
streetcar and then an electric street

00:30:59
car which started to be introduced in

00:31:03
European Western European cities around

00:31:05
1890s and then became extremely Popular

00:31:08
by the 1920s

00:31:12
that led to well we moved to this second

00:31:15
state let's say to the industrial city

00:31:17
led to a huge revolution of of how

00:31:20
cities could be conquered by its by its

00:31:23
inhabitants how they could be managed

00:31:24
navigated by by its inhabitants

00:31:29
um

00:31:30
that also allowed or led to the decision

00:31:33
to to engage in construction of a number

00:31:35
of underground uh tramways as they were

00:31:38
first called The Underground systems

00:31:39
first

00:31:40
uh in London and 18 as early as 1863

00:31:44
then Budapest in 1896 and the First

00:31:47
Northern American system in Boston in

00:31:49

00:31:52
and that that marked the beginning of of

00:31:54
as I said a revolutionary change in a

00:31:57
golden era of the development of Railway

00:31:58
Transport Systems as Railway networks

00:32:01
expanded tremendously and became the

00:32:03
dominant land transport for both

00:32:05
passengers and for Freight and that was

00:32:08
valid or is valid for both inter-urban

00:32:11
and intra intra-urban transport

00:32:14
why was this invention revolutionary

00:32:16
well of course because

00:32:18
increased speed allowed to cover

00:32:20
increased distance so suddenly the for

00:32:22
instance the idea of of still living

00:32:25
within the very medieval perimeter of

00:32:27
the city uh was or started to be to be

00:32:31
questioned the idea of expanding the

00:32:33
city to the suburb or connecting the

00:32:34
villages and the suburbs to the to the

00:32:37
city proper began to to make a lot of

00:32:40
sense so that led

00:32:42
um

00:32:43
was one at least one of the ideas why in

00:32:46
a number of uh cities across Europe City

00:32:48
walls where um were demolished

00:32:53
see that here in in Brussels so first uh

00:32:56
horse drawn card I think it's a

00:32:58
photograph from the 1890s

00:33:00
so end of the 19th century and

00:33:03
1910 uh I think it's a great Royal in

00:33:06
Brussels you already see and uh no I

00:33:09
think that's is that a horse

00:33:12
I think it actually is already it's an

00:33:15
electric one although I don't see the

00:33:16
cables I thought it was an electric but

00:33:18
I think it might still be

00:33:20
um pulled by a horse although you don't

00:33:21
see that from uh well the drum that is

00:33:24
heading in our direction does not have a

00:33:26
have a horse pulling it

00:33:30
right so

00:33:33
I already mentioned this in a little bit

00:33:35
so a revolution in urban travel a

00:33:38
breaking uh mode that's allowed to

00:33:43
um to rethink the air before made an

00:33:45
impact on it in a great way breaking

00:33:48
this idea of a compact dense medieval

00:33:51
city allowing to extend what we what was

00:33:54
considered to be a city to up to 20 or

00:33:57
30 kilometers in Diamond if you think

00:33:58
that the previous

00:34:00
um let's say model of a city had up to

00:34:02
five This was um

00:34:04
an expansion of four to six six times

00:34:09
what also appears in in this process uh

00:34:13
of course it's not all related to

00:34:14
transport but it's happening at more or

00:34:16
less the same time and it makes a big

00:34:18
impact on on what transport is in the

00:34:20
city and what a role is is that this

00:34:23
expansion of the urban form in space

00:34:25
allows for some specialization of

00:34:27
different functions especially economic

00:34:29
functions and what it also creates or

00:34:32
contributes to the creation of is the

00:34:34
creation of a working class of of a

00:34:36
specific group a social group of course

00:34:39
Very diverse internally but a group that

00:34:43
um sells its time for a living that uh

00:34:46
of course with the Industrial Revolution

00:34:48
does that not anymore at home but

00:34:50
actually starts what we start calling

00:34:53
commuting to its uh to its workplace

00:34:56
where

00:34:59
things are being produced what profit is

00:35:01
being made and where their salary

00:35:03
workers is exchanged uh for uh for money

00:35:07
for a salary

00:35:09
um that separation as I mentioned being

00:35:11
absolutely fundamental for decades of of

00:35:14
analysis of transport to to come so

00:35:16
focus on this commute from from work to

00:35:19
home and vice versa

00:35:22
moving to the next some technical issues

00:35:25
here moving to the next uh stage of

00:35:28
Urban Development we can put it very

00:35:30
very roughly of course a fundamental

00:35:34
invention of of the car not only the

00:35:36
invention of the car proper because the

00:35:38
well the vehicle itself I mean we can go

00:35:41
back to the first the diesel engine

00:35:44
invented in the 90s of the 19th century

00:35:46
pneumatic tire four-stroke engine

00:35:48
invented a few years later and that led

00:35:51
to the construction of the first

00:35:53
automobiles as they were called back

00:35:55
then in 1890s

00:35:58
um but it was fundamentally the

00:36:00
massification of of the current the

00:36:02
invention of this particular model uh

00:36:05
which I'm sure you've

00:36:06
or a lot of you probably have heard

00:36:08
about already the Model T by Ford uh

00:36:11
which began to be produced in 1913 and

00:36:13
famously Mr Ford said that this model is

00:36:16
available in any color as long as it is

00:36:19
black the idea being that with

00:36:21
unification of

00:36:23
universalization of the model uh getting

00:36:26
rid of any options of any customization

00:36:30
of any personalization

00:36:33
um and also the implementation of today

00:36:36
is being called taylorism so reaching a

00:36:41
near automated way of producing this

00:36:43
this vehicle with very strictly measured

00:36:45
time for every single activity that

00:36:48
that was part of the production process

00:36:50
the final price of the production and

00:36:53
the final price for the consumer could

00:36:55
be reduced as much as possible meaning

00:36:57
that this product this commodity could

00:37:00
be available to to White masses and that

00:37:03
does begin uh from the 1910s already but

00:37:07
especially from the 1930s uh when indeed

00:37:10
the price started going significantly

00:37:12
down the era of of the automobile the

00:37:15
era of a mode which I'm sure that if you

00:37:18
you know turn on the news about Brussels

00:37:20
or any other Western European North

00:37:22
American city uh by that debate also uh

00:37:25
is very very present in many African

00:37:27
Latin American South Asian cities

00:37:30
um it's a mode that is very much on the

00:37:32
agenda whenever you talk about whenever

00:37:34
you hear about transport

00:37:37
and we're going to talk about that I

00:37:39
guess tonight if not in a week as a very

00:37:43
uh well as a very present mode of

00:37:46
Transport in our cities and also very

00:37:47
problematic mode of Transport that

00:37:48
attracts a lot of condensation a lot of

00:37:50
uh

00:37:52
um a lot of anger and a lot of

00:37:54
um creative and critical thinking in

00:37:56
terms of what's the alternative to the

00:37:57
to the automobile

00:37:59
so it's been almost a century now that

00:38:01
our cities if we think about it from the

00:38:03
global North uh I don't know benefiting

00:38:06
or suffering from that from that no you

00:38:08
tell me

00:38:09
um

00:38:10
famously from 1913 to 1927 Ford managed

00:38:14
to build 15 million units 15 million

00:38:17
Vehicles making it the second most

00:38:19
produced car in history right after

00:38:21
Volkswagen Beetle

00:38:23
um which was also they began the

00:38:25
production a little bit later but also

00:38:27
in the period between the first and

00:38:29
second World War

00:38:31
so why uh well this we've covered

00:38:34
already mostly but well the most

00:38:37
important thing here is in the last

00:38:39
bullet points I mean why is the car such

00:38:43
a revolutionary and such an important

00:38:44
mode of transports to be to be mentioned

00:38:46
here is that for the very first time

00:38:48
Mobility

00:38:50
um modernized Mobility is an individual

00:38:52
exercise it's no longer only a motorized

00:38:55
or a horse horse-drone streetcar that

00:38:58
allows you to cover long distances of

00:39:01
taking a train a Suburban train that

00:39:03
takes you to the factory and back but

00:39:05
it's an it is an individual vehicle an

00:39:07
individual product that allows you to

00:39:09
reach unprecedented levels of of

00:39:12
individual Mobility

00:39:14
and of course that uh immediately uh had

00:39:18
a very important impact on on the way

00:39:21
that the cities are planned and and

00:39:22
imagined

00:39:26
um

00:39:28
well

00:39:31
without running the risk of uh or maybe

00:39:33
a little bit of you know drawing some

00:39:36
kind of caricature this impact

00:39:39
um starting from especially the second

00:39:40
world war when when it was a very strong

00:39:43
Narrative of the need of modernizing

00:39:46
um cities especially in North America

00:39:48
and Western Europe

00:39:50
a lot of cities be became basically

00:39:53
um

00:39:55
well perfect space for for for for

00:39:57
driving around a space in which huge

00:40:01
amounts of infrastructure for this

00:40:03
individual car based Mobility was built

00:40:06
this process started a little bit early

00:40:08
in the US and the 1940s and 50s already

00:40:10
and after the second world war

00:40:13
um that narrative was started to be very

00:40:15
present in in Western European as 50

00:40:17
both of these images by the way come

00:40:19
from a really wonderful film by uh

00:40:22
Jacques tatti I believe it's called

00:40:24
playtime from the 1967 which I really

00:40:26
recommend you watch it's a great

00:40:27
critique of this idea of this training

00:40:30
of modernity which also very much hinges

00:40:33
on on the idea of having a car of um

00:40:36
of driving around

00:40:39
um and well moving to more serious stuff

00:40:42
I mean accommodating the current city

00:40:45
meant that

00:40:47
serious infrastructure had to be built

00:40:49
uh series have had to happen in in

00:40:51
cities at the time for for the car to

00:40:55
receive this kind of space

00:40:57
um

00:40:58
some of the most important projects

00:41:00
happen in the US as I mentioned on the

00:41:02
on the left hand side you've got the

00:41:04
Franklin Delano Roosevelt drive and

00:41:06
opened in 1966 in New York on the right

00:41:09
hand side the infamous Ponte Morandi in

00:41:11
in Genoa in Italy 1967 which

00:41:13
unfortunately collapsed I believe two

00:41:16
years ago which also symbolized of

00:41:20
course it's a it's a terrible terrible

00:41:22
event but for for many it was a very

00:41:25
powerful symbol of this infrastructure

00:41:27
crumbling and an important question of

00:41:29
what to do with these relics of

00:41:32
um of modernity or past modernity

00:41:35
whether they should be in this case

00:41:38
rebuilt or maintained or invested in

00:41:41
whether this is something that we want

00:41:42
to gradually dismantle uh and and stop

00:41:45
subsidizing the maintenance of these

00:41:47
infrastructures is um undoubtedly very

00:41:50
costly

00:41:52
and the next slide uh does anybody have

00:41:55
a clue where this city is

00:42:00
very good well done yes this is the uh

00:42:06
I don't remember the name of the road

00:42:08
but uh yeah yeah it's in the next slide

00:42:10
I'm so silly green belch are nine built

00:42:13
in 90 or opened in 1976. I don't know if

00:42:16
you've ever had the experience of of

00:42:18
driving this but it's really uh it's

00:42:20
uncanny it's it it makes me personally

00:42:22
feel as if I was in some uh Chinese or

00:42:26
other Asian City where you're on this

00:42:28
elevated platform almost gliding through

00:42:31
through the city so it's really one of

00:42:33
the

00:42:34
uh I think most extreme or more extreme

00:42:36
cases at least in this part of of Europe

00:42:38
of

00:42:39
um really plowing through through a city

00:42:42
to build this Motorway uh Ring Road

00:42:46
but chalawa was not the only one I mean

00:42:49
we are after all or I don't know where

00:42:51
you are right now but most of us are in

00:42:53
Brussels right now and Brussels was

00:42:55
definitely also a playground for many of

00:42:57
these many of these ideas and the idea

00:43:00
of bringing the car and opening the city

00:43:01
to the car

00:43:02
like in American cities at least that

00:43:04
was the comparison used in Belgium

00:43:06
became particularly strong and

00:43:08
particularly

00:43:11
um potent among the political class the

00:43:13
decision makers around 1958. what

00:43:16
happened in 1958 I guess you've heard

00:43:19
that date before

00:43:21
any non-belgians

00:43:23
1958 why is that important for Brussels

00:43:28
the atomium and why would the atomium be

00:43:31
uh well okay the World Expo symbolized

00:43:34
by the atomium and why would that be

00:43:36
related to the car

00:43:43
um you really don't have any ideas

00:43:47
I mean if you opening a World Expo for

00:43:50
the very first time in Belgium and

00:43:51
inviting I don't remember how many

00:43:53
people actually visited the Expo in the

00:43:55
end but millions of people uh visited

00:43:57
the city why why would a car be

00:44:00
important of the car be important in

00:44:01
that regard

00:44:05
so for putting Belgium on the map

00:44:16
yes it's to solve the idea of I mean not

00:44:19
the idea the problem of congestion is to

00:44:21
bring these masses to the Expo and back

00:44:23
is to allow for a better communication

00:44:25
but also to put Belgium on them to show

00:44:27
that Belgium is a modern country to show

00:44:29
that it's it's on you know Cutting Edge

00:44:32
and being Cutting Edge in 1958 and those

00:44:34
who meant opening the city for the car

00:44:36
and

00:44:37
building huge infrastructure or start at

00:44:40
least to build huge infrastructure that

00:44:42
would accommodate this new modern uh us

00:44:46
like

00:44:47
um American way of of mobility of moving

00:44:51
around the city

00:44:53
uh so yeah uh some things that are quite

00:44:58
quite Unthinkable today uh were going on

00:45:00
at that time so this is Gohan plus uh I

00:45:03
think it's in the 1960s

00:45:05
so of course Expo was a symbolic event

00:45:08
it didn't really uh I mean it was it was

00:45:11
not just tipping points there were a lot

00:45:14
of Dynamics happening at that time and

00:45:16
the Expo was maybe a more of a symbolic

00:45:18
moment but it is around the time that

00:45:21
the level of motorization so the level

00:45:23
of ownership of cars in Belgian

00:45:25
households and similar processes are

00:45:28
mentioned in Belgium here but similar

00:45:29
things were going on in France in

00:45:30
Germany

00:45:31
uh in the UK it went through the roof

00:45:35
um so it was

00:45:37
it was very very common back then to uh

00:45:41
to invest in a car as a symbol of of

00:45:43
advancing as a household as a symbol of

00:45:45
social Mobility not only a physical uh

00:45:48
geographical Mobility that of course

00:45:50
meant that more and more space had to be

00:45:52
given to the car and as the car became

00:45:54
more present more people bought the car

00:45:55
so the circle was closed and it was a

00:45:58
vicious one

00:45:59
in Brussels specifically well one of the

00:46:02
most important infrastructures built at

00:46:04
the time is the Petit Center so the Ring

00:46:06
Road that surrounds the Pentagon of the

00:46:09
city I'm sure that you've all have been

00:46:11
there so essentially the

00:46:14
well the the framing of it right the the

00:46:18
actual shape of the Pentagon comes from

00:46:21
the city was the second walls of

00:46:22
Brussels uh coming from the 14th century

00:46:25
uh completely destroyed which defined

00:46:27
the historic center of the city still

00:46:28
and until the 1950s it was a very much

00:46:31
an urban Boulevard in which one could

00:46:33
stroll and and walk very much like in

00:46:35
the

00:46:36
drawings rather than photographs that I

00:46:37
showed you at the beginning from this

00:46:39
city of walking city that was very much

00:46:41
defined by by The Pedestrian mode of

00:46:44
moving around

00:46:47
um and in relation to the 1958 that had

00:46:50
to be gradually uh transformed so a

00:46:53
series of first tunnels were built then

00:46:55
uh the service was raised to uh to open

00:46:58
to the car it took 20 years of work

00:47:01
which is not a very unusual thing in

00:47:02
Brussels uh to do so two decades of

00:47:04
extremely heavy work uh and very

00:47:06
destructive work whole neighborhoods

00:47:08
have to be relocated destroyed to

00:47:10
rebuilt

00:47:12
um so opened in 1976 uh with 15 tunnels

00:47:15
surrounding the city also quite

00:47:18
importantly and that's maybe a bit of an

00:47:20
extreme story that not necessarily

00:47:22
happened also in France or in Germany or

00:47:24
in other Western European cities but

00:47:26
what was very crucial in Brussels is

00:47:28
that the engineering teams or the

00:47:31
engineering offices consultancy officers

00:47:33
who would call them today would receive

00:47:35
a personal bonus on top of their salary

00:47:37
for every kilo kilometer of an

00:47:39
underground tunnel built so that led to

00:47:42
creation of a huge push to build

00:47:45
underground infrastructure for Mobility

00:47:48
both for for cars but also for railroad

00:47:51
and Metro uh and that led to a creation

00:47:54
of very important expertise in building

00:47:56
these underground tunnels uh which of

00:47:58
course once you have that expertise you

00:48:00
of course want to keep building more

00:48:02
because that's what you are very good at

00:48:04
doing and that problem in Brussels well

00:48:07
problem of situation exists until today

00:48:10
where we have huge teams of engineering

00:48:13
Specialists who specialize in building

00:48:15
underground it's in steep in the public

00:48:17
transport company in Brussels half of

00:48:19
the company is responsible for for Metro

00:48:21
for maintenance and construction so you

00:48:24
can imagine that what you want to do of

00:48:26
course is to keep building and Metro

00:48:28
which is what they are currently doing

00:48:30
in Brussels

00:48:32
um moving a little bit or zooming out a

00:48:34
little bit from cities

00:48:36
um the large-scale diffusion of of the

00:48:39
car or the automobile is a mass

00:48:41
consumption project of course was uh

00:48:44
strongly also influenced or maybe also

00:48:46
LED so it's a two-way Dynamic to the

00:48:49
emergence of first Nationwide Highway

00:48:52
systems in the first one uh created was

00:48:55
of course the one in the US the American

00:48:57
interstate highway system which began to

00:49:00
be not maybe completely built from

00:49:01
scratch but the first framing of it and

00:49:04
continuous gradual addition to the

00:49:07
network in 1956.

00:49:11
um which was of course back then uh that

00:49:14
symbol of modernity that

00:49:16
um in many many places in Belgium being

00:49:19
one of them influence the definition of

00:49:22
the idea of what was Modern what was

00:49:24
cutting-edge was technologically

00:49:26
advanced

00:49:28
today of course uh it's not the us

00:49:32
anymore that it's the leading uh country

00:49:34
or the leading power in terms of the

00:49:36
development of Transport technology and

00:49:38
and highways in particular uh that

00:49:40
system that American system has been by

00:49:43
now surpassed definitely by the one in

00:49:46
China the national trunk highway system

00:49:48
here I have a little bit of an old graph

00:49:50
but by 2011 as far as I can read it well

00:49:54
but already 2009 the total amount of

00:49:57
kilometers of motorways in both

00:49:59
countries us and China was equal and the

00:50:02
one in China of course was Rising still

00:50:04
very

00:50:05
um very steep but you can see that this

00:50:08
I don't like the term but let's say the

00:50:11
catching up or this idea of following a

00:50:14
little bit in the footsteps of what the

00:50:16
Americans did in the 1950s in China

00:50:18
happened in an extremely

00:50:20
um short time which not only because of

00:50:23
the construction of the motorways but

00:50:25
this was a very important part of the of

00:50:27
the construction boom meant that

00:50:30
um

00:50:31
from 2006 2007 onwards now the situation

00:50:35
is a little bit different because of the

00:50:37
ongoing crisis and also other problems

00:50:39
the Chinese economy uh suffered from but

00:50:41
the consumption of the the demand for

00:50:44
concrete in China was bigger than in all

00:50:46
other countries around the world

00:50:47
combined so this was really a boom of an

00:50:51
unprecedented scale and we will see a

00:50:54
few other graphs and down the lecture

00:50:56
which

00:50:57
show us that while in many cities many

00:51:01
countries around what we might be

00:51:02
thinking that we are moving away from

00:51:04
the current right now but that's the

00:51:06
idea that the other parts of the world

00:51:09
that did not experience this development

00:51:11
at the same time as Global noise are now

00:51:13
and definitely contributing to um to not

00:51:18
even I would say Persistence of

00:51:19
automobility but actually it's

00:51:20
continuous rise on the global scale

00:51:23
what was very important going back to

00:51:26
the Belgium uh context of the 1950s and

00:51:29
1960s it's also difficult to say what

00:51:32
was first the car or the suburbs or the

00:51:35
suburbs and the car but the two were

00:51:37
extremely uh strongly linked with one

00:51:40
another having the car

00:51:41
and as I mentioned as I explained the

00:51:45
car became a very common popular and

00:51:47
cheap commodity not only defined how we

00:51:50
moved to to uh to work and you move

00:51:52
around the city but actually it's again

00:51:54
redefined what the city is so suddenly

00:51:56
areas which would be normally considered

00:51:59
rural become accessible and become

00:52:02
interesting for people to to settle in

00:52:04
the idea also being and that you have

00:52:07
more space more freedom

00:52:09
you are close to you are close to Nature

00:52:12
etc etc these days it might be it might

00:52:15
feel like it's something of the past

00:52:17
something that is uh yeah not

00:52:20
interesting to to many urbanites of

00:52:23
today day but back then it was

00:52:25
absolutely the way to the way to go the

00:52:27
way to live the way to think uh that one

00:52:30
should invest as a household in

00:52:34
the home Marketing in property Market

00:52:38
um

00:52:39
the special

00:52:40
[Music]

00:52:42
results of of that of the double Dynamic

00:52:45
of motorization on the one hand

00:52:47
suborganization on the other was that if

00:52:51
a pre-industrial city had more or less

00:52:53
10 of its space devoted to transport and

00:52:57
Mobility an industrial a modern city has

00:53:01
between 15 and 30 percent and that's

00:53:04
rough estimates from Western Europe to

00:53:06
up to 60 percent in in some American

00:53:08
cities of space will be given to uh to

00:53:12
Mobility infrastructure which is

00:53:13
principally uh highways and and parking

00:53:17
lots which of course uh is a is a huge

00:53:21
spatial cost

00:53:24
and uh well another development of

00:53:26
course is that uh the commuting area as

00:53:29
we we start to call it so the the actual

00:53:33
um

00:53:34
definition of what a city is regardless

00:53:36
of administrative limits and different

00:53:38
boundaries of course this would be often

00:53:39
divided into some municipalities and all

00:53:41
it goes up to uh 100 kilometers in

00:53:45
diameter so suddenly what is a city

00:53:47
becomes

00:53:48
um or starts becoming a little bit vague

00:53:51
in the sense that the old Urban course

00:53:53
of course do not hold all the functions

00:53:56
anymore and we start seeing cities

00:54:00
um expanding in this economic uh

00:54:02
economic terms

00:54:05
well

00:54:09
without running into the risk of of

00:54:12
simplifying things a little bit too much

00:54:14
but what happened in a lot of cities

00:54:16
both in North America and in Western

00:54:19
Europe is that as the car became more

00:54:21
and more popular and as moving by car

00:54:24
became absolutely common

00:54:26
um and if you basically had a middle

00:54:28
class job and that's that's what you did

00:54:31
you lived in the suburbs and you

00:54:32
commuted to the office job by car

00:54:35
Transit companies or mass transit

00:54:38
companies public transport companies

00:54:39
started to run into serious financial

00:54:41
difficulties so

00:54:44
um traditionally uh when they were

00:54:46
actually set up in the 19th or end of

00:54:49
the 19th century 1910s 1920s they would

00:54:51
be private companies very often private

00:54:53
arailroads bringing workers to the

00:54:55
suburbs and dark or bringing the

00:54:57
Bourgeois and people who wanted to enjoy

00:55:00
Leisure outside of the city and then

00:55:02
back

00:55:02
as they started to run into trouble in

00:55:05
some countries and that's usually the

00:55:08
case in Western Europe they would be

00:55:09
nationalized they will be taken over by

00:55:11
the state as an important part of

00:55:13
military infrastructure but also an

00:55:16
important part of Mobility

00:55:17
infrastructure and kept but they roll

00:55:20
the societal role would definitely

00:55:22
decline so it would be it would become

00:55:23
something not necessarily for the middle

00:55:26
class but rather for the working class

00:55:28
Belgium here is some sort of an

00:55:31
exception because a lot of commuting

00:55:34
here and due to the fact that the

00:55:35
railway system was traditionally been

00:55:38
very dense

00:55:39
hadn't happened and still is happening

00:55:42
uh very much through public transport

00:55:43
but that's definitely not the case in

00:55:45
the UK for example or definitely not in

00:55:47
North America

00:55:48
but and sticking to North America

00:55:52
um in a number of uh cities over there

00:55:55
the process that happened uh was

00:55:57
inversed so the decline of public

00:55:59
transit did not lead to any uh

00:56:01
investment by the state either on the

00:56:03
federal or the state state level uh but

00:56:06
rather

00:56:07
um

00:56:08
eventually a dismantling of of public

00:56:10
transport systems happened and a very uh

00:56:14
particular story is that of the General

00:56:16
Motors Company so one of the main

00:56:18
producers of of these Mass Commodities

00:56:20
the cars

00:56:22
um who throughout the 1940s basically

00:56:25
bought a number of public transport

00:56:27
companies mass transit companies as they

00:56:28
are called over there and purposely led

00:56:30
to the decline uh why well the idea was

00:56:34
quite simple and it was basically to get

00:56:36
rid of the competitions that public

00:56:37
transport

00:56:38
um could have

00:56:39
um could have posed to the to the

00:56:42
individual Mobility to to the car so the

00:56:44
idea was to push public transport out of

00:56:46
the market and again

00:56:49
um

00:56:50
I just saw the comment from somebody

00:56:53
and and again yes the idea of course was

00:56:57
that this was also framed by the

00:56:59
discourse of modernity and and advancing

00:57:02
as a society

00:57:03
um I forgot to mention but we will be

00:57:05
taking uh a break in both today and then

00:57:07
a week uh I don't think that you know

00:57:09
sticking to the screen for two hours is

00:57:11
a healthy thing to do so we will take a

00:57:13
break actually in three minutes probably

00:57:14
for about five minutes

00:57:16
uh just in case you're getting a little

00:57:18
bit tight

00:57:21
but this uh total decline or some could

00:57:26
even say a disaster in terms of what

00:57:28
happened to mass transport must transits

00:57:30
or in public transport was not uh always

00:57:32
the case so as I already mentioned in in

00:57:35
some countries uh public transport

00:57:37
networks are actually what being taken

00:57:39
over by the state and even invested in

00:57:41
and one important thing that happens or

00:57:43
you know a symbolic project that

00:57:45
happened is that of copenhagen's finger

00:57:47
plant from 1947 uh so basically their

00:57:50
the decision was made to create an

00:57:52
alternative or maybe not a substitute

00:57:55
but an alternative parallel to car

00:57:56
commuting basically Suburban rail which

00:57:59
follows the shape of five fingers uh

00:58:02
corridors that would not only be

00:58:04
transport corridors but also along which

00:58:07
a number of different functions

00:58:09
especially residential but also economic

00:58:12
work related functions would be

00:58:15
um placed as well and that was uh as far

00:58:18
as I know one of the first plans that uh

00:58:21
tried to achieve what we call transport

00:58:23
oriented development or development

00:58:25
Urban Development that happens around or

00:58:28
in this particular case a long transport

00:58:30
corridors to allow for different

00:58:33
Mobility options back then maybe

00:58:35
environmental issues were not so much on

00:58:37
the agenda but the idea was that people

00:58:38
would be able to get more efficiently to

00:58:40
work not only by car but also by

00:58:42
Suburban rail

00:58:45
uh in our lovely Brussels well things

00:58:49
were not so

00:58:50
not so easy or well things were a little

00:58:53
bit in between so on the one hand the

00:58:55
car was definitely the king and actually

00:58:57
it's one of the uh slogans in in

00:59:00
let's say Brussels centered Academia and

00:59:02
public debate Carr became the King

00:59:05
around the 1950s with the Expo of the

00:59:07
1958 and still very much is a very

00:59:09
present and very privileged mode of

00:59:11
transport

00:59:12
but public transport of course did not

00:59:14
disappear and one of the particularities

00:59:15
of Brussels is that unlike in Charlotte

00:59:18
for example or many cities in Germany or

00:59:22
in France especially tramways for

00:59:23
example were never completely dismantled

00:59:25
and you would see and I can't think of

00:59:29
any specific names right now in France

00:59:31
but there are cities in which tranway

00:59:33
network existed uh 1940s 50s and 60s and

00:59:37
then was completely dismantled to open a

00:59:41
surface space to the car so what

00:59:43
happened in Brussels is that the Trump

00:59:45
was basically put underground so you see

00:59:48
on top left

00:59:50
which is that magnificent Urban Waterway

00:59:53
these days and you see a tram trying to

00:59:56
plow its way through the through the

00:59:58
city standing in a traffic jam the idea

01:00:01
uh well of course the city is packed the

01:00:04
space is limited with the rise of

01:00:05
mobility and individual mobility and the

01:00:08
rise of the number of cars traffic jams

01:00:11
happen the decision there was May need

01:00:13
not to make more space for the tram

01:00:14
would make to make more space for the

01:00:16
car so strategic decision was to put the

01:00:19
tram first on the ground creating a very

01:00:22
particular mode of transports made in

01:00:24
Brussels called pre-metro premature

01:00:26
which then eventually

01:00:29
um as it was actually planned was

01:00:31
converted into into a full-scale as we

01:00:34
call it in Brussels heavy metal look you

01:00:37
can actually see in pre-metro still and

01:00:39
that's line three and four in in

01:00:40
Brussels the tramline that goes from

01:00:42
north to south of the Pentagon which as

01:00:44
you probably have heard

01:00:46
is now well will soon be converted into

01:00:49
a proper Network once and the new metro

01:00:51
line from God you know and northwards is

01:00:54
constructed uh so you can for example

01:00:56
see I don't know if you ever had a

01:00:59
chance of of uh you know noting that the

01:01:01
platforms and although this is a trump

01:01:02
stock the platforms are actually much

01:01:04
much wider than usually would be in the

01:01:06
case of a tram and they are much longer

01:01:08
basically they were built I think

01:01:10
already back in the 70s anticipating a

01:01:13
proper Metro we are now in 2020 so

01:01:16
finally the Metro is is happening

01:01:18
although well it's a controversial

01:01:19
project to say the least

01:01:22
um let's take a little break here not

01:01:25
longer than five six minutes so grab

01:01:28
another tea or a coffee and I'll see you

01:01:31
back in four or five minutes all right

01:01:33
great

01:01:35
see you in a moment

01:06:38
welcome back overview I hope you grabbed

01:06:41
another drink or whatever it is that you

01:06:43
are having or grab another notebook to

01:06:46
keep noticing things although of course

01:06:48
you've got the recording of all this

01:06:50
um and I can see that some people are

01:06:52
asking questions

01:06:54
um I might also ask you if up to now up

01:06:58
to now everything has been clear or if

01:07:00
you've got any questions about what I've

01:07:02
been talking about if yes please raise

01:07:04
your hand just speak up but I think it's

01:07:06
an interesting question that Mika asked

01:07:09
here in the chat with um

01:07:12
indeed what was happening right now is

01:07:14
that we have an increased desire for

01:07:17
uh what we could say is a pre-industrial

01:07:19
city a city of walking of uh short of

01:07:22
distances density of users mixes

01:07:26
um does anybody have an opinion on this

01:07:28
would you agree would you not agree

01:07:37
or maybe Mika whoever he or she is has

01:07:39
an opinion

01:07:41
that's me

01:07:42
um

01:07:43
yeah I wasn't sure if it's really linked

01:07:46
to the pre-industrial city but when you

01:07:49
explained

01:07:51
um

01:07:52
how how it was looking how how it looked

01:07:55
like I thought about like actually it's

01:07:58
exactly what today's planning is about

01:08:00
like this

01:08:01
uh mixed use this like

01:08:05
a narrow uh streets where you yeah with

01:08:09
walkability and short distances and I

01:08:14
mean maybe it's also really a European

01:08:16
perspective

01:08:20
maybe it could be like a new role model

01:08:24
of today's planning does anybody have an

01:08:28
uh an opinion on this would anybody like

01:08:30
to react

01:08:39
I can compare with for example in

01:08:41
interrupt

01:08:43
um I'm living

01:08:43
[Music]

01:08:44
um

01:08:45
in the center of the city and

01:08:48
what we see is uh that the place for

01:08:52
um private cars is reducing for example

01:08:55
they they put parking lots under

01:08:57
undergrounds for making some some

01:09:00
leisure activities or Parks or something

01:09:03
else so we see a movement I guess when

01:09:06
we focus on that and definitely in

01:09:09
Brussels depending on the policy now

01:09:12
um it's more ecological

01:09:14
minded and we see more

01:09:18
um opportunities to to reduce

01:09:20
parking lots and and more movements like

01:09:24
for example in unspec land yeah

01:09:27
um

01:09:29
so this pedestrian area of Brussels yeah

01:09:31
yeah and we couldn't imagine I guess 20

01:09:33
years ago so we see different movements

01:09:37
yeah there is definitely some kind of

01:09:39
shift happening I mean we are not in the

01:09:42
1960s or 70s not where like what is

01:09:45
right now on the slide things have moved

01:09:47
on the present of the car is definitely

01:09:49
put on the question but is this about

01:09:51
going to a free industrial city what

01:09:54
would be the problem with that or would

01:09:55
be the risk of

01:09:57
um just reverting to walking let's say

01:10:00
if that's what the pre-industrial city

01:10:02
was about

01:10:04
does anybody have you know an opinion on

01:10:07
this

01:10:08
there is no wrong answers here

01:10:12
Vitality is saying that new Mobility

01:10:13
plans are aiming at the best of use of

01:10:15
all Technologies we have now with

01:10:17
maximum inclusivity

01:10:18
yeah I guess so

01:10:21
um the proof is in the in the you know

01:10:24
well depends on how they of course

01:10:27
implement it and and it's the idea of

01:10:29
course is that everybody is included and

01:10:31
we use all the Technologies we have

01:10:34
in practice we will see that it's a

01:10:35
little bit complicated

01:10:36
um

01:10:39
maybe it's also the like when we were

01:10:41
looking at the Metro System that it's

01:10:44
more about underground transportation

01:10:47
so like separation okay

01:10:51
transportation systems mm-hmm somebody

01:10:54
somebody else started uh talking who was

01:10:58
that yeah that was me and also

01:11:00
also what I wanted to bring up was the

01:11:04
where industry

01:11:05
industry or small businesses are still

01:11:07
located and where people can have you

01:11:10
know

01:11:11
um can find jobs almost in their in

01:11:13
their neighborhood that it it you know

01:11:15
especially maybe jobs that don't

01:11:18
necessarily pay so well that wouldn't be

01:11:20
interesting for other people to to

01:11:22
commute into the city too and I think

01:11:25
these kind of businesses are a bit under

01:11:27
pressure from the reduction in space

01:11:29
that they have on you know to to

01:11:32
organize these productive activities so

01:11:34
I think yeah space in front of there in

01:11:38
front of the street to to actually do

01:11:41
their deliveries and I think there's

01:11:43
attention there in the kind of city

01:11:46
um you want and the way you want the

01:11:48
service different neighborhoods and

01:11:50
different

01:11:51
um different areas so one of the cases

01:11:53
was like um these smaller construction

01:11:57
um supplies kind of stores maybe in the

01:12:01
area of lack and like not far from the

01:12:03
canal you know serving a kind of a

01:12:06
secondary places where you know you just

01:12:09
wouldn't go to Bricco for those kind of

01:12:11
um materials you would go to your

01:12:13
neighborhood and that's that's becoming

01:12:15
harder with uh you know to to maintain

01:12:18
in a in an urban environment that gives

01:12:21
more space to walking and to to to to

01:12:24
um yeah to bike lanes and so on so

01:12:27
that's on the one side it doesn't mean

01:12:28
that I agree but it's I think one of the

01:12:30
one of the pressures that is being

01:12:34
um this is being felt by by that by that

01:12:37
group I mean I guess what's what's

01:12:39
important what you said and to relate it

01:12:41
also to what I was talking about before

01:12:42
and what we tell you there is the

01:12:43
writing is that there is some with each

01:12:45
of these technological shifts of course

01:12:47
they are very

01:12:49
um I mean it's a very broad sketch these

01:12:51
things were not happening in in sudden

01:12:54
turns it's a it's a process but the

01:12:57
space is valorized in different ways and

01:12:59
for example if we see here in this slide

01:13:01
as I mentioned

01:13:03
um

01:13:04
clearly space became very limited with

01:13:06
the rise of the cars and the decision

01:13:07
was made that the space is extremely

01:13:10
valuable and it should be given to the

01:13:11
modes that it's the most efficient in

01:13:14
terms of speed as the most rational mode

01:13:16
also not only economically or or

01:13:19
temporally efficient so other modes like

01:13:22
public transport or I don't even mention

01:13:24
cycling there had to disappear or be

01:13:27
moved elsewhere and I think what's

01:13:29
happening right now is some kind of

01:13:30
revolarization of space

01:13:33
um but space is always limited so if you

01:13:35
take it uh I mean if you give it to one

01:13:38
or some set of users

01:13:40
which I think also perhaps we will have

01:13:43
time to talk about it next week has a

01:13:45
clear class component so there is a

01:13:46
clear middle class idea and behind

01:13:49
opening Central uh Urban spaces to

01:13:53
walking cycling and public transport and

01:13:54
taking it away from the car so if you

01:13:57
give it to these kind of users you have

01:13:58
to take it away from others in this case

01:14:00
the car

01:14:01
and I think an important question is to

01:14:03
ask well if we want the car to disappear

01:14:06
from the city like from Brussels who is

01:14:08
using the car right I mean who is who is

01:14:11
dependent on it for example these

01:14:13
businesses small shops that um I don't

01:14:17
know either well I mean they play

01:14:20
productive activity requires

01:14:21
accessibility by car but also I think

01:14:24
um probably you've heard and right now

01:14:26
in this pandemic crazy times people are

01:14:28
talking about 15-minute neighborhood and

01:14:30
the idea of how

01:14:31
the pandemic has shown us that we can

01:14:34
well since we uh essentially many of us

01:14:37
stop a lot of activities we started

01:14:38
walking around and cycling and all that

01:14:40
so the idea that maybe we could use this

01:14:43
to reorganize the cities around uh 15

01:14:45
minutes perimeters walking pyramids

01:14:48
within which we can all find all the

01:14:49
uses and functions that we need but I

01:14:52
think an important question there is who

01:14:54
actually lives so close to a good school

01:14:57
a good job and all that and then

01:15:00
Brussels but in many other cities there

01:15:03
will be a lot of people who need to find

01:15:04
employment uh quite far from where they

01:15:06
live and a lot of them would have to go

01:15:09
by car to to get to that job so what you

01:15:12
know what then

01:15:15
um

01:15:16
I will continue with the with the

01:15:18
lecture but I hope there will be space

01:15:20
for for more for more questions

01:15:22
um there was one point that I want to

01:15:24
make that is you know I don't want to

01:15:27
say main conclusion of this historical

01:15:29
trajectory but I think an important

01:15:31
Point

01:15:33
um to keep in mind in in all this is

01:15:35
that

01:15:36
um

01:15:38
it's not just a well it's not just a

01:15:40
descriptive you know took the fox of

01:15:42
what different modes of Transport were

01:15:44
there and and how it impacted the urban

01:15:46
reform I think this is something that is

01:15:48
maybe a little bit interesting but

01:15:49
essentially I don't think it's very

01:15:51
critical and doesn't really allow us to

01:15:53
understand uh too much about how the

01:15:55
city functions or functioned in the past

01:15:57
I think what's very important though is

01:15:59
that with each of these shifts with each

01:16:01
of these

01:16:03
um turning points and dynamics that led

01:16:05
to to uh to a shift in terms of how

01:16:07
people moved we were getting closer and

01:16:10
closer

01:16:11
um to the situation that we have today

01:16:13
which is that transport is absolutely

01:16:15
crucial uh not only for the development

01:16:17
of cities but for the development of

01:16:19
the socio-economic system which we live

01:16:23
uh today on a global scale which is that

01:16:25
of of global capitalism uh so it would

01:16:28
be import impossible for for the current

01:16:30
socioeconomic relations to to develop to

01:16:32
the point that they have developed

01:16:33
without transport and without the

01:16:35
development of transport and vice versa

01:16:37
so outside of the capitalist system

01:16:39
there probably would not have been such

01:16:41
such a push for development of

01:16:43
individual vulnerability for example and

01:16:45
individual Mobility by car that is

01:16:47
propelled by fossil fuels uh with all

01:16:50
the geopolitical and environmental uh

01:16:52
atrocities and impacts that this this

01:16:54
produces

01:16:57
um essentially transport or transport

01:16:59
geography is a discipline uh required

01:17:02
space Not only to be conquered

01:17:05
physically intensive distance basically

01:17:07
uh moving from A to B would become as

01:17:10
fast as short of a time as possible but

01:17:14
also uh some kind of imaginary and

01:17:16
cartographical colonization or

01:17:18
conquering of space if we go back to end

01:17:22
of the 18th century for example in

01:17:23
Europe uh well the majority of people

01:17:26
who inhabited uh well maybe eight of the

01:17:28
17th century could be a little bit less

01:17:29
controversial but the majority of people

01:17:31
who lived on our continent and

01:17:33
definitely the majority of people who

01:17:34
lived on our planet did not live on the

01:17:37
jurisdiction of any state or any any

01:17:38
state Administration they essentially

01:17:41
lived outside State structures of course

01:17:42
State States and administrations existed

01:17:45
but most people lived in villages in

01:17:48
areas where once in a once in a while a

01:17:51
tax collector would maybe show up it

01:17:52
would be quite easy to avoid the

01:17:54
encounter with that kind of gentleman

01:17:56
rather not gentle woman I'm afraid

01:18:00
so

01:18:01
it's at this point and I think transport

01:18:03
is absolutely crucial for understanding

01:18:05
of why this happened and how this

01:18:06
happened that there happened or began to

01:18:09
happen some kind of strategic expansion

01:18:11
of State infrastructure and state

01:18:12
Administration predominantly related to

01:18:14
security reasons and search for you know

01:18:16
different forms of capital uh for

01:18:20
instance slavery so trying to uh reach

01:18:23
different places where bodies could be

01:18:24
could be snatched taken into captivity

01:18:27
and then and then sold or propelled into

01:18:29
productive activity

01:18:31
um but for the state to be able to

01:18:34
organize this process it had to develop

01:18:36
its cartography it has to develop its uh

01:18:39
dominance its knowledge its control over

01:18:41
the over space

01:18:43
and here we see a map of France in 1632

01:18:46
which is essentially well we've seen

01:18:48
some roads we see some cities and and

01:18:50
connections between those

01:18:53
um but this radically changes with uh

01:18:56
the development of States interest in

01:18:58
terms of the resources uh as I mentioned

01:19:00
bodies people but also of course other

01:19:03
natural resources would anything that

01:19:05
you can mine and well I don't know I'm

01:19:08
not a specialist here in terms of who

01:19:10
you can be interested in as a state but

01:19:11
uh what essentially happened is that

01:19:15
um

01:19:15
from a natural space a space that was

01:19:18
inhabited a space that was lived uh we

01:19:21
started moving into a fire name of

01:19:24
obstructive of uh of absolute space that

01:19:27
is very much related to the

01:19:28
consolidation of of States

01:19:30
infrastructure as a way of organizing

01:19:33
social and material order that is on the

01:19:35
ground to bureaucratically govern it to

01:19:38
rule it from the distance from a very

01:19:40
top-down perspective

01:19:41
the example of France is very

01:19:43
interesting because literally over there

01:19:45
the decision was made of course not

01:19:47
immediately not at one meeting but

01:19:49
progressively

01:19:50
um it was a state bureaucrats arrived a

01:19:53
decision to divide the state in more or

01:19:54
less equally shaped

01:19:57
um

01:19:57
areas the Departments and based on a

01:20:00
regular grid on the left hand side you

01:20:03
see there's some kind of

01:20:03
conceptualization of this on the right

01:20:05
hand side we see a result which is the

01:20:07
the actual the eventual Division I think

01:20:10
one of the first ones uh in in the in

01:20:12
the French territory I think today of

01:20:15
course it's not exactly the same that

01:20:16
has developed for uh different

01:20:18
historical reasons but the idea was very

01:20:21
important that the seven the

01:20:22
administrative reform of the 1790 would

01:20:26
replace some old feudal uh tribal even

01:20:28
uh division of territories

01:20:31
into

01:20:32
um it would be replaced with abstract

01:20:34
bureaucratic logic that would be applied

01:20:37
and more or less the same way in each of

01:20:40
these each of these territories each of

01:20:42
these uh departments

01:20:45
as we can skip uh what was very

01:20:49
important in this in this development is

01:20:51
that the state needed very much uh

01:20:54
um Universal

01:20:57
[Music]

01:20:57
um

01:20:58
and how to put it a reliable system of

01:21:01
measuring space and other related

01:21:04
phenomena such as for example time or

01:21:06
quantity it might be very difficult for

01:21:09
us to to imagine this but the

01:21:11
unification of of measuring systems both

01:21:14
of time and space and quantity was

01:21:16
something that took a very long time and

01:21:18
it was definitely not in place until end

01:21:21
of the even 17 or 18th century so it

01:21:23
took a very long time to actually make

01:21:25
sure make sure that all the inhabitants

01:21:29
of a given nation state of a given

01:21:31
territory would actually subjugate

01:21:33
themselves to the usage of of a unified

01:21:35
that's the word I was looking for

01:21:37
unified metric or measurement system so

01:21:41
for example the unification of the

01:21:42
metric systems in Germany took place in

01:21:44
as late as 1868 in Austria in 1871 and

01:21:47
Hungary three years later in Russia in

01:21:49
1919 and in China only in 1959. what

01:21:53
does it mean it means that there existed

01:21:56
of course ways of measuring but there

01:21:57
will be culturally dependent or there

01:21:59
will be spatially dependent so a

01:22:01
particularly a unit of measurement a

01:22:03
foot an elbow

01:22:05
would mean different things in different

01:22:08
Villages would mean different things at

01:22:09
the different times of the day or yeah

01:22:11
it would mean different things whether

01:22:12
it would be the activity of selling or

01:22:15
of buying so for example you would sell

01:22:18
a small bag of rice and buy a big one

01:22:22
um

01:22:22
there was a difference between and

01:22:24
that's in many pre-colonial African

01:22:27
communities kingdoms there will be a

01:22:30
division between strong measures for

01:22:32
selling goods and weak measures for for

01:22:35
buying loans so there was a huge

01:22:37
diversity of different ways of measuring

01:22:40
space measuring time and measuring

01:22:42
quantity all that in order and also

01:22:45
because of and again this is a two-way

01:22:48
Dynamic the development of the transport

01:22:50
system and the development of State as a

01:22:52
institution or a set of Institutions

01:22:54
that had to control space quantity and

01:22:56
time gave way to a unified system

01:23:01
of which transport is absolutely Central

01:23:03
and here I mean the symbolic one meter

01:23:06
which is of course a huge abstract

01:23:09
agreement that we are in that this is

01:23:12
what one meter is and same could be said

01:23:14
about a kilogram a second and many

01:23:16
others

01:23:17
moving a little bit more uh well going a

01:23:20
little bit more into transport here

01:23:23
um I mentioned time and for example as

01:23:25
late as in the 18th century uh distance

01:23:28
between particular cities and as a

01:23:30
result of travel time speaking in

01:23:31
particular cities such as in Germany

01:23:33
we're not fixed or or set

01:23:37
um so in 1881 German Railways or

01:23:40
different kinds of German Railways

01:23:41
because there was no one National system

01:23:43
followed five different time zones which

01:23:45
were different not by one hour but by a

01:23:47
different amount of minutes which meant

01:23:49
that basically one area I guess they are

01:23:53
here color coded would be five or seven

01:23:55
minutes ahead of the other one which

01:23:57
meant that the passengers had to do the

01:23:58
calculation themselves it was all an

01:24:01
oral agreement and an ongoing discussion

01:24:03
between

01:24:05
um between the passengers and the staff

01:24:06
to understand at what time uh things

01:24:08
would happen what time the train would

01:24:10
depart leave

01:24:12
Etc

01:24:14
um

01:24:15
and as I mentioned the this integration

01:24:19
of of measurement system integration of

01:24:21
uh of different modes of Transport

01:24:24
networks allowed the state to control to

01:24:28
consolidate the territory and to

01:24:30
um and to yeah to basically be able to

01:24:33
develop socioeconomic relations that we

01:24:36
take today very much for for granted

01:24:40
um this was absolutely crucial I mean

01:24:42
the reason why I'm making this a bit of

01:24:44
a digression and the departure from you

01:24:46
know this historic uh trajectory is that

01:24:48
this was absolutely crucial this

01:24:50
colonization of space and colonization

01:24:52
of what we consider to be a very much of

01:24:54
a social or could consider a social

01:24:56
activity that movement and transport is

01:24:58
was absolutely crucial for the

01:25:00
development of again what we take very

01:25:02
much for granted the global networks of

01:25:04
wires cables railroads highways in this

01:25:07
particular case I already show you that

01:25:10
um that map

01:25:12
allowing transport to to lubricate the

01:25:16
capitalist global global system

01:25:18
and today this colonization of space uh

01:25:22
if we can call it this way it's no

01:25:23
longer a national matter is no longer

01:25:25
nation states that are propelling this

01:25:26
process it's something that is happening

01:25:28
very much on the on the global scales

01:25:31
um

01:25:33
what was very important in this very

01:25:36
long trajectory I started very quickly

01:25:38
at the end of the 17th century and now

01:25:40
we are in 1950s what was very important

01:25:43
is that a whole science developed around

01:25:45
uh this colonization of different

01:25:48
measuring systems of different uh ways

01:25:51
of of living and interacting with space

01:25:54
and this science of this scientific

01:25:56
field

01:25:57
I think we can call it a set of

01:26:00
neoclassical perspectives on not only

01:26:02
transport but also in economics on

01:26:04
social life which in transport itself is

01:26:07
very much present is very much dominated

01:26:10
by

01:26:11
um on the one hand transport Engineers

01:26:13
on the other hand transport Econo

01:26:15
economists what I'm talking about here

01:26:16
is basically

01:26:18
um the main say and I will not talk a

01:26:21
lot about this but basically if you went

01:26:23
to

01:26:25
um a master degree which I'm very happy

01:26:27
you did it but if you went to a mass

01:26:29
degree in in transport management or

01:26:31
Logistics at any Technical University

01:26:34
this is very much what you would be

01:26:35
learning today

01:26:36
I guess at this time of the Neo night

01:26:38
which we are a bit more boring I hope

01:26:40
than what I have to offer but

01:26:43
um hope there is no regrets here in the

01:26:45
room today but uh if you want to be an

01:26:47
engineer and if you want to be an

01:26:48
economist to build roads this is

01:26:49
basically what you what you learn why is

01:26:52
it called neoclassical transport well

01:26:54
very much it relates to new classical

01:26:56
economics which deals with uh a

01:26:59
cold-blooded analysis A study of

01:27:02
distribution production of goods outputs

01:27:05
and and income through uh and that's

01:27:07
absolutely crucial supply and demand so

01:27:10
a system which has to be in a permanent

01:27:13
equilibrium

01:27:15
which essentially looks at transport as

01:27:18
a part or a separate Market in which

01:27:22
transport is a good commodity which is

01:27:25
offered in the market passengers being

01:27:28
the being its consumers

01:27:32
um

01:27:33
what is important here there are two

01:27:35
main principles which very much today

01:27:38
again in Academia but also very much in

01:27:41
the world of practitioners so the wealth

01:27:43
of those who plan roads who build roads

01:27:45
who claim that we need a new metro line

01:27:46
we need Motorway or that this or that

01:27:49
particular mode of Transport is

01:27:51
absolutely essential for for

01:27:52
contemporary cities to thrive

01:27:54
so these two dogmas say that on the one

01:27:57
hand transport is an essentially

01:27:59
rational discipline it's a it's a

01:28:02
discipline that is rational because it

01:28:04
has to be developed by by experts it's a

01:28:07
top-down discipline that requires this

01:28:09
top-down cartographic vision of space

01:28:12
which can be reduced to its absolute

01:28:14
Universal measures

01:28:17
um that also means that there is a

01:28:18
science behind it which means that it's

01:28:20
not an issue that can be fully opened to

01:28:22
a public debate it's a it's a part of

01:28:25
urban life that has to be developed by

01:28:27
experts and only experts can have the

01:28:30
final word in terms of decision making

01:28:31
uh in terms of how transport develops

01:28:34
why and and using what most

01:28:38
um there is a very strong prediction

01:28:40
there in this uh in this in this field

01:28:42
of of knowledge that transport geography

01:28:44
or or transport economics engineering

01:28:46
are essentially objective Sciences they

01:28:48
are they are much more on the side of

01:28:50
science sciences and Humanities for

01:28:52
example they they purpose being pursuing

01:28:55
objectivity and truth that's a quote

01:28:57
from another very important textbook on

01:28:59
on transport geography the idea being is

01:29:02
that we can arrive some kind of absolute

01:29:04
truths in terms of what is good

01:29:06
transport and wonder what is bad which

01:29:09
essentially are translatable

01:29:11
transferable from one locality to

01:29:13
another so if uh if we go back to the

01:29:16
1950s if the US cities develop

01:29:21
motorways and develop car infrastructure

01:29:23
which is efficient and rational this is

01:29:24
a solution that can also work in dense

01:29:27
medieval European cities uh such as the

01:29:30
ones in Belgium Brussels for example

01:29:34
um

01:29:34
crucially this line of thinking and that

01:29:37
maybe didn't develop in the end of the

01:29:39
17th or 19th century but was definitely

01:29:42
a result of this uh process that I

01:29:45
called the colonization of space

01:29:47
this field of of thinking and and

01:29:50
producing uh transport Consolidated

01:29:52
itself around the 1930s and 40s and that

01:29:56
propelled

01:29:57
um measurements and engineering studies

01:29:59
that allowed to to construct these

01:30:02
um into urban and intra-urban Motorway

01:30:05
systems and this very much continues

01:30:07
today following a rule of predicting uh

01:30:10
demand for for Mobility predicting

01:30:13
passenger flows or traffic flows and

01:30:17
providing necessary infrastructure for

01:30:19
it so basically most of Transport most

01:30:23
of which transport models do is predict

01:30:27
where would these flows go and provide

01:30:30
essential infrastructure an extension of

01:30:32
a

01:30:33
of Road Lane a construction of a new

01:30:36
Motorway construction of a new Metro uh

01:30:38
line and you name it

01:30:42
so that's one part of the rationality of

01:30:44
Transport the other part is that the

01:30:46
assumption is that the user itself uh

01:30:49
and uh it's yeah yeah the user itself is

01:30:54
also a rational being it's a homo

01:30:57
economicus it's an it's an economically

01:31:00
minded being that

01:31:03
um almost on a regular basis on a daily

01:31:05
basis conduct some kind of economic

01:31:06
analysis in terms of what is uh an

01:31:10
efficient way of of reaching a

01:31:11
destination B from from point A in terms

01:31:14
of time in terms of cost

01:31:16
um being making pragmatic free and and

01:31:19
very much utility-based choices in terms

01:31:22
of how to move and where to move

01:31:25
so in other words a market a market that

01:31:28
is being governed by by the laws of uh

01:31:30
of Economics which very much in this in

01:31:34
this line of thought are being compared

01:31:35
to the laws of physics a lot of these

01:31:38
models would have for example allusions

01:31:40
to gravity so gravity models that uh in

01:31:43
a natural-like way pools uh flows of

01:31:46
passengers to some destinations rather

01:31:48
than others because for example economic

01:31:50
activities present in an area

01:31:53
so that's

01:31:55
principle of Dogma number one and number

01:31:57
two is that uh there is this very strong

01:32:00
conviction and funny enough still not

01:32:04
fully fully proven but uh but the

01:32:06
conviction is very much there that

01:32:07
investment in transport infrastructure

01:32:10
uh of course uh that part is not

01:32:12
controversial leads to higher speeds uh

01:32:15
leads to lower travel times at least

01:32:17
lower transaction costs if you want to

01:32:19
move from A to B or yourself or some

01:32:22
Goods it's basically cheaper leads to

01:32:24
Economic Development so the better

01:32:26
infrastructure we have the the higher or

01:32:29
the better the growth of a locality so

01:32:32
if you want the city to be economically

01:32:35
prosperous uh wealthy you need

01:32:39
um you need Quality Transport

01:32:41
infrastructure

01:32:44
um

01:32:45
so that very much is on the pin by this

01:32:49
um by this quote that I already

01:32:50
mentioned earlier today that the unique

01:32:52
purpose of Transport is in fact to to

01:32:54
limit to reduce space and time that is

01:32:57
needed to cover the space to zero that

01:33:00
that is the unique purpose of of

01:33:01
movement in in the city which also means

01:33:05
that the travel time itself is an

01:33:06
unproductive activity because from the

01:33:09
monetary perspective if you want to go

01:33:10
from A to B

01:33:12
um well you want to get there as quickly

01:33:13
as possible the time of getting there

01:33:15
itself is not a valuable activity now

01:33:18
there are I mean there's a flurry of

01:33:20
problems here starting from the fact

01:33:21
that if you actually ask people through

01:33:23
studies uh what they do when they take

01:33:25
the metro or where they cycle which is

01:33:27
such a complicated and multi-faceted

01:33:30
activity they very often say that this

01:33:32
is actually a very important part of the

01:33:34
day that commuting on public transport

01:33:36
for example allows them to catch up with

01:33:38
friends to read to relax to meditate

01:33:41
cycling being as I mentioned

01:33:43
multi-faceted activity allows people to

01:33:46
get relaxed work out

01:33:49
get an endorphin kick and and all that

01:33:52
and that's so much more than just moving

01:33:54
from from one place to

01:33:56
um to another

01:33:59
um but again without trying to draw some

01:34:03
kind of caricature I think it's

01:34:04
important to to understand that this way

01:34:07
of thinking about transport leads us to

01:34:10
a formulation of an absolutely

01:34:11
fundamental problem uh in inverted

01:34:14
commas that a lot of Engineers transport

01:34:16
Engineers transport economists recognize

01:34:18
and that problem is congestion if you

01:34:21
focus on a fluid flow of

01:34:24
passengers cars whatever the transport

01:34:27
mode is any obstruction to that flow any

01:34:30
obstruction to that model is a is a

01:34:32
problem that has to be solved

01:34:34
and that problem has to be solved

01:34:36
because otherwise the system is

01:34:37
irrational that's talking about number

01:34:39
one and

01:34:41
the second reason is that uh and unless

01:34:44
you do that you uh you can

01:34:47
um

01:34:48
hamper the economic growth the economic

01:34:50
development of of the locality that

01:34:52
you're in in charge of

01:34:54
as I mentioned this uh this beneficial

01:34:58
supposedly beneficial relationship

01:34:59
between transport development and

01:35:01
economic development so better roads

01:35:03
mean better transport better exchange of

01:35:05
goods and services

01:35:07
um that of course Works to some extent I

01:35:09
mean you can you can see that happening

01:35:11
theoretically at least from scratch in

01:35:14
um in many cities many countries of the

01:35:17
global South but then uh this relation

01:35:19
has never really been theorized it's

01:35:21
never really been proven and it will be

01:35:22
extremely difficult to to make that

01:35:24
claim in cities that are postmodern so

01:35:28
such as Brussels or many other cities in

01:35:30
the global North but actually

01:35:31
increasingly also Global South so

01:35:33
addition of infrastructure especially

01:35:35
road infrastructure car infrastructure

01:35:38
um and it's anticipated impact in terms

01:35:41
of economic growth Economic Development

01:35:43
it's it's a very controversial issue

01:35:45
that

01:35:46
um well it's not really we don't have

01:35:48
any tangible proof or tangible enough to

01:35:51
to uh to say with certainty that this is

01:35:54
the case

01:35:54
but it's an argument that you can hear a

01:35:57
lot and including in Brussels and

01:35:59
Belgium

01:36:01
is this clear do you have any questions

01:36:04
this is usually where people are

01:36:05
scratching their hands a little bit so I

01:36:08
want to make sure that you are okay

01:36:10
uh nobody is writing anything in the

01:36:13
chat no Angry comments I keep

01:36:16
advancing here then

01:36:19
um so what happens when you when you

01:36:21
believe that what you do is is rational

01:36:23
and and it's very important for Society

01:36:25
for economy

01:36:26
well you essentially engage in I mean

01:36:31
um developing more and more and more to

01:36:33
elaborate and complicated mathematical

01:36:35
models that try to predict not only to

01:36:38
describe what's happening without

01:36:40
actually trying to predict uh what is

01:36:42
going to happen and what is now

01:36:44
happening very much in the business of

01:36:46
transport economics and transport

01:36:47
engineering is modeling human behavior

01:36:49
so trying to predict uh where people

01:36:52
will be interested in going and not

01:36:54
anymore where where they are actually

01:36:56
are heading and where these flaws are

01:36:58
being distributed in an urban

01:37:00
environment what's crucial here is that

01:37:03
this field is extremely not only

01:37:04
extremely Technical and quantitative but

01:37:06
it's very indescriptive so this logic of

01:37:09
Transport Supply and transport demand is

01:37:11
is devoid of any social uh cultural

01:37:14
political uh relations so

01:37:18
when I say that a transport user this

01:37:20
homo economicus is considered to be this

01:37:22
rational utility-based uh person or

01:37:26
figure that makes these rational choices

01:37:28
in terms of where they go and how any

01:37:30
issue of gender any issue of class or

01:37:33
ethnicity of age is

01:37:36
um at best mentioned but given a very

01:37:39
little weight if we are talking about

01:37:41
modeling so these different aspects can

01:37:43
be given different ways given different

01:37:45
importance importance different levels

01:37:47
of levels of importance and these issues

01:37:50
are quite simply not not there and of

01:37:52
course we will be discussing this a

01:37:54
little bit I mean these different

01:37:55
critical approaches such as

01:37:58
well some anti-capitalist marxists

01:38:02
feminist

01:38:03
uh any radical Theory social theory the

01:38:07
exposure to those in engineering

01:38:09
programs is close to none

01:38:12
um which basically means that without

01:38:14
trying to be you know too critical about

01:38:16
the engineers who are trying to do their

01:38:17
job

01:38:18
um basically they they are really not

01:38:20
aware of of the complexity of social

01:38:22
relations and spatial relations that are

01:38:24
happening in the city so everything that

01:38:25
you've learned with David bass and Nick

01:38:28
by now this is this is simply not there

01:38:31
um a city according to this vision is

01:38:34
essentially a a model that can be

01:38:37
um constructed calculated and put in

01:38:40
place and you can predict what will

01:38:43
happen uh tomorrow or the day after

01:38:45
based on that in any City in the in the

01:38:49
world

01:38:49
now that thinking uh has a very yeah

01:38:54
very very strange uh way of Imagining

01:38:58
the city essentially if a city is or any

01:39:01
Urban space is more of a field of

01:39:03
application than than actually a side of

01:39:05
any Dynamics or conflicts or

01:39:07
contradictions uh different interests in

01:39:09
terms of what should be happening in

01:39:11
that space in that in that society and

01:39:13
I'm sure that you've all come across um

01:39:16
uh maybe even these drawings or similar

01:39:19
ones from from Nicole busier and his and

01:39:22
his friends and allies who basically

01:39:24
imagine that this is exactly what should

01:39:25
happen in in a modern city that these

01:39:28
models not only related to transport in

01:39:30
this case also to housing or generally

01:39:32
Economic Development should be literally

01:39:34
applied in a city

01:39:36
um so the idea there would be that in

01:39:39
order to for that model to be as

01:39:40
efficient as possible everything in the

01:39:43
city especially it's medieval it's

01:39:45
pre-industrial uh remnants would have to

01:39:48
be raised the city would have to become

01:39:49
black empathy slave on which this model

01:39:53
could be applied

01:39:56
so

01:39:59
even though

01:40:01
this maybe wasn't its most extreme in

01:40:05
the 1950s in the 1960s when these Urban

01:40:07
motorways were being constructed when as

01:40:10
I showed you these Urban tramways and

01:40:12
Brussels were being put on the ground

01:40:14
and a lot of heavy construction offers

01:40:17
destruction had to be done this thinking

01:40:20
still very much applies this if you if

01:40:22
you tune in to Engineers from

01:40:24
construction offices in Brussels or

01:40:26
elsewhere in Belgium

01:40:28
northern Europe the idea is that uh

01:40:31
planning still has to fall follow uh

01:40:34
some rational rules of solving

01:40:36
congestion uh in Brussels for example we

01:40:39
have a Belgium a long-standing debate

01:40:40
about what to do with the Ring of

01:40:42
Brussels the Ring Road whether it has to

01:40:43
be expanded or not every single time

01:40:45
there is an engineer talking on the

01:40:47
radio or on the news what their solution

01:40:49
would be is to add to the infrastructure

01:40:51
because basically if you have traffic

01:40:53
jams that generates lost time that's

01:40:55
detrimental to the economy you have to

01:40:57
expand that infrastructure in order for

01:40:58
the flows to be more fluid and

01:41:01
unobstructed

01:41:03
This Modern neoclassical thinking also

01:41:06
uh well thinking about the fluidity of

01:41:10
flows and and removing barriers to these

01:41:13
led to a separation of different modes

01:41:15
of Transport so this is this is why we

01:41:18
would have uh overpasses uh food bridges

01:41:22
that would allow of well separate

01:41:25
pedestrians from Cars For example so

01:41:27
allow the cars to have

01:41:29
um a smooth smooth space infrastructure

01:41:32
to for movement while pedestrians would

01:41:34
have to

01:41:36
cross it uh cross it over all the energy

01:41:40
and that of course also

01:41:43
um that line of thought would be very

01:41:45
much related or very much inspired also

01:41:46
by the development of individual

01:41:48
Mobility via VIA the car right so the

01:41:51
car being not only this extremely

01:41:53
freeing mode of Transport also a very

01:41:55
rational and very fast way of moving

01:41:57
around

01:41:58
now

01:42:00
we arrived to the 1970s let's say and

01:42:03
something very important happened around

01:42:05
that time

01:42:06
would anybody have an idea looking at

01:42:08
the pictures uh What uh what I have in

01:42:11
mind

01:42:13
not change the way that we look at the

01:42:16
car the change of the way we look at the

01:42:18
transport

01:42:19
the only crisis in the oil crisis I

01:42:21
guess somebody already mentioned that in

01:42:23
one of the classes

01:42:24
so the oil trucks of the 1970s

01:42:27
um when first in the 1973 uh the

01:42:31
organization of our petroleum exporting

01:42:33
countries so essentially the the Persian

01:42:35
Gulf countries uh instituted Noel

01:42:38
embargo in the 1979 Iranian Revolution

01:42:41
uh took place that's not something that

01:42:43
you can easily model that's geopolitics

01:42:46
for you and what basically happened is

01:42:47
that the global oil prices went through

01:42:49
the roof

01:42:50
um not maybe for a moment for a longer

01:42:53
time but and then they went

01:42:55
um down a little bit to a level that

01:42:57
allowed of course for for car-based

01:42:59
Mobility to to continue but the what

01:43:02
basically happened was that

01:43:04
um on a global scale

01:43:06
decision makers people who were in

01:43:09
charge of Designing transport

01:43:10
infrastructure realized that this

01:43:12
Limitless Mobility by car has its um

01:43:15
it's its economic cost First of all that

01:43:17
fossil fuels might not be as available

01:43:20
as as they as they used to be but also

01:43:22
around that time began to begin some

01:43:26
kind of uh

01:43:29
move to this slide already uh

01:43:32
reflection on on different externalities

01:43:35
of different also social and

01:43:37
environmental costs that are related to

01:43:39
to car based Mobility these

01:43:41
environmental costs being for example

01:43:43
are predominantly noise

01:43:45
of course accidents health related

01:43:48
issues uh mostly related to pollution

01:43:51
that is that is created by by individual

01:43:54
costs

01:43:57
um

01:43:57
and around that time I mean maybe it's

01:44:00
also difficult for us to imagine but

01:44:01
until the 1970s the idea that a car uh

01:44:06
to be efficient in terms of its fuel

01:44:08
consumption it has to be safe in terms

01:44:10
of making sure that if it hits other

01:44:12
vehicles or with his pedestrians or

01:44:14
cyclists it has to be more or less safe

01:44:17
and and that there are these different

01:44:19
areas of the car that uh that absorb the

01:44:22
the energy of the impact that was all uh

01:44:26
essentially noted there with some

01:44:28
exceptions uh a car was

01:44:31
um the cars were not efficient from the

01:44:33
from the economic perspective from the

01:44:35
environmental perspective either

01:44:37
uh what changed is that well I'm again

01:44:42
moving very fast to these uh through

01:44:45
these developments but what changed is

01:44:47
that there was uh first a reflection on

01:44:50
the environmental and impact of the car

01:44:52
itself

01:44:53
um and a general reflection on the on

01:44:55
the question of sustainable development

01:44:57
of development that

01:44:59
allows uh future generations to benefit

01:45:02
from the same resources from the same

01:45:04
opportunities that we are we are

01:45:06
benefiting from today so some kind of

01:45:09
beginning of a reflection in terms of

01:45:11
the planetary limits of of the growth

01:45:13
that our societies are of the societies

01:45:16
at the time where we're engaging in

01:45:20
and also an idea that uh

01:45:23
uh cities are absolutely crucial for

01:45:25
that in that process that in order to

01:45:29
arrive with uh at sustainability of the

01:45:31
development on the planetary level uh

01:45:34
cities have to uh have to also be

01:45:36
transformed in order to become more

01:45:39
sustainable

01:45:43
why is that important and we arrive to

01:45:46
to today to contemporary situation well

01:45:50
it's important and yeah this is as also

01:45:53
the title uh says this is the

01:45:56
let's say a

01:45:58
another set of also very dominant and

01:46:00
very very important hegemonic

01:46:02
perspectives on transport sustainable

01:46:05
Urban transport this is because

01:46:06
transport is recognized today as one of

01:46:09
the most important sources of um or

01:46:11
contributors to pollution here we uh see

01:46:14
that it's at least 14 of CO2 Emissions

01:46:17
on the on the global scale as the uh

01:46:19
direct emissions

01:46:22
um and also while the graph I would say

01:46:24
that it's a little bit controversial

01:46:25
because you also could add much more in

01:46:27
terms of the different other related

01:46:29
course on construction and and the way

01:46:32
that housing is constructed as as a

01:46:34
function of of availability of Transport

01:46:36
but let's say we stick to the 14 of

01:46:39
global emissions being related directly

01:46:41
to transport which makes transport one

01:46:43
of the

01:46:45
um well here I'm a little bit wrong that

01:46:47
is the largest single source of global

01:46:48
Transportation emissions because you

01:46:49
immediately see that industry is at 21

01:46:51
but it can be also boiled to the

01:46:53
different sectors and all that but

01:46:55
what's very important with transport is

01:46:57
that this um definitely one of the

01:46:59
fastest if not the fastest uh Rising uh

01:47:02
contributed to to emissions so every

01:47:04
year the increase is the highest among

01:47:05
all economic sectors globally so Global

01:47:08
Climate problems are essentially

01:47:10
increasingly transport problems this is

01:47:13
uh this is let's say maybe not Point of

01:47:16
Departure but one of the main

01:47:17
reflections of this perspective on on

01:47:19
the issue

01:47:21
what also is very important is that as

01:47:23
you see on the left hand side the global

01:47:26
proportion of people living in in urban

01:47:28
communities is rising so one if in 2010

01:47:32
we were already after this magic uh

01:47:36
threshold of 50 or more of people living

01:47:38
in cities as opposed to the countryside

01:47:40
in 2030 the projection is that it will

01:47:43
be 60 of people living in cities and

01:47:45
that will go up to at least 67 in 2015.

01:47:49
of course this is a mantra that I'm sure

01:47:51
that at least those of you who follow

01:47:52
the master and urban Studies have

01:47:54
already heard before that we are living

01:47:56
in an urban society that you know and

01:47:59
our planet is essentially in urban and

01:48:02
urban planetary urbanization there's a

01:48:04
lot of Concepts uh flying flying around

01:48:08
but it's important and it is a fact that

01:48:12
increasingly the global population

01:48:13
becoming more and more urban it's in the

01:48:16
cities that a lot of these problems will

01:48:18
have to be addressed so the urban

01:48:19
Mobility is not only the transport is

01:48:21
crucial for solving the climate crisis

01:48:23
but it's the urban transport that

01:48:25
constitutes definitely a very important

01:48:27
uh challenge that has to be addressed so

01:48:30
we see that and that's the right hand

01:48:32
side graft graph that Urban Mobility

01:48:35
demand for urban Mobility is rising uh

01:48:38
almost exponentially

01:48:39
and that's expressing trillions of

01:48:41
kilometers per year here uh that it Rose

01:48:44
from uh 2010 to 2030 by uh 68 percent

01:48:49
now we might think that with all the

01:48:53
reflection on externalities that cars

01:48:55
have and produce an environmental and

01:48:58
social aspects that are very detrimental

01:49:00
to to our lives

01:49:03
um that we are moving away from the car

01:49:06
this is a perspective that we already

01:49:08
had a short charge on that there is a

01:49:11
shift so we start to look at Urban space

01:49:13
a little bit differently we want less

01:49:14
cars to be present in it and in fact on

01:49:17
a global scale

01:49:18
um if you look at the on the left hand

01:49:20
side as a cumulative figure so the

01:49:23
global number of all registered cars uh

01:49:26
the rise is is ongoing and it's um and

01:49:29
it's huge and that's

01:49:32
well also seen in the graph on the right

01:49:35
hand side where we see non-cumulative

01:49:37
yearly amount of cars being sold

01:49:40
on a global scale so we see that every

01:49:43
year the amount of cars being sold is

01:49:45
rising 2019 being some sort of an

01:49:48
exception we have a little bit of a drop

01:49:50
but what the graph doesn't not show is

01:49:53
the amount of SUV so the sports utility

01:49:56
vehicles as they are called which went

01:49:58
through the roof in 2018 and 2019 their

01:50:01
contribution environmentally speaking

01:50:03
being much uh High a few times higher

01:50:05
than regular vehicles what also you can

01:50:08
see over there is that in Orange if you

01:50:11
see that the contribution we can call it

01:50:13
this way of the European Union countries

01:50:15
in terms of the number of cars sold is

01:50:18
more or less stable so here we don't see

01:50:20
um an important rise if you look at

01:50:23
India in Gray and then on China in Blue

01:50:26
uh here the difference between 2005 and

01:50:30
2019 is significant

01:50:32
so there is a lot of economies some call

01:50:36
them developing economies I'm not really

01:50:38
a fan of the word but um

01:50:40
a lot of nation states a lot of

01:50:42
societies where where the levels of

01:50:44
motorizations were relatively low and

01:50:46
this commodity is is definitely becoming

01:50:49
uh more and more available it's not

01:50:51
exactly the same process that was

01:50:52
happening uh in in northern Europe or

01:50:55
North America or Western Europe or North

01:50:57
America in the 1940s 50s and 60s but uh

01:51:01
it's definitely a steep rise of

01:51:03
motorization of Mobility levels which

01:51:06
raises a lot of environmental questions

01:51:08
but also ethical issues in terms of

01:51:10
whether this is something that

01:51:14
um well we now with our Western Northern

01:51:16
eyes are looking at very critically

01:51:19
matter of fact it's something that these

01:51:21
people these societies have the right to

01:51:22
engage in as as we did as our parents

01:51:25
and grandparents did some decades ago

01:51:29
um but what is very important here I'm

01:51:31
going to skip this one slide is that

01:51:33
this debate if we can put it this way

01:51:35
shifts its attention so we're moving

01:51:38
away from the problem of congestion the

01:51:41
problem of uh

01:51:43
unobstructed flows uh the problem of

01:51:46
rationality the problem of Economic

01:51:48
Development we see that this Economic

01:51:50
Development has its

01:51:53
um environmental price if we can put it

01:51:57
this way and in a very important and

01:51:59
very important and symbol of that in

01:52:01
mobility in transport is the car is is

01:52:04
the car is the

01:52:05
important contributor to to that uh to

01:52:09
that cake in terms of pollution in terms

01:52:11
of externalities of

01:52:13
um of transport

01:52:15
and next time so we still have a bit

01:52:18
time for questions maybe discussion

01:52:21
we're going to talk about specific

01:52:23
examples of how transport develops along

01:52:26
this line of thought

01:52:28
but and I think we'll be uh well it's

01:52:32
definitely not the only thing we're

01:52:33
going to do because as I will also

01:52:35
explain in a week

01:52:37
um that perspective also is extremely

01:52:39
Limited in its lack of social and also

01:52:42
spatial understanding of the city so a

01:52:45
simple critique of the car as the

01:52:47
problem is also leading us into a number

01:52:50
of traps which mean that our

01:52:54
understanding of how people enjoy or do

01:52:57
not enjoy Mobility because of the class

01:52:59
the gender the ethnicity and many other

01:53:01
factors is extremely Limited

01:53:06
so I put a little comma here

01:53:09
um I wonder if you have any questions

01:53:11
any points of discussion

01:53:14
we still have 12 minutes so we might as

01:53:16
well use them

01:53:18
just ice

01:53:24
I might

01:53:25
um

01:53:26
try to initiate a little discussion here

01:53:30
about about popularity of cars and

01:53:34
um

01:53:35
and the Smiths that we're now seeing of

01:53:38
of the of the of the lifestyle on high

01:53:42
speed and Etc

01:53:45
um I observed a curious a curious thing

01:53:49
that on TV in Belgium at least I don't

01:53:52
usually watch TV but I happen to watch

01:53:57
uh one night with my friends like a

01:54:01
generic Belgium Belgium program and

01:54:05
during the advertisement

01:54:07
uh period all the ads a vast majority of

01:54:11
them were about cars

01:54:14
and uh

01:54:16
in any or in all ways they were trying

01:54:19
to sell either a lifestyle the

01:54:22
ecological ecological idea that new cars

01:54:26
to be can be green and Etc but I was

01:54:30
wondering if we might ever arrive to to

01:54:35
to this

01:54:36
um to this thinking that we should not

01:54:39
be advertising this anymore as we don't

01:54:42
advertise cigarettes or I don't know

01:54:45
hard alcohol on on

01:54:48
TV and in media and whether it makes

01:54:52
sense or it doesn't

01:54:56
it's an interesting thought we will

01:54:58
actually come back to it next time but I

01:55:00
wonder if somebody has already you know

01:55:02
an opinion on this

01:55:04
should advertising car cars or sales

01:55:07
cards would be banned because it's

01:55:09
but for society

01:55:20
maybe I can even add to this that

01:55:24
um

01:55:24
I've been watching Belgian TV for a long

01:55:26
time as I'm convention and um

01:55:30
I there always used to be uh car

01:55:33
commercials but in the last two years

01:55:36
um actually most of them has have been

01:55:39
for SUV

01:55:41
uh cars or like there's been a bit shift

01:55:45
to

01:55:46
making commercials for SUV cars which

01:55:49
yeah I find really strange yeah

01:55:53
well

01:55:57
um yeah I think it's it's happening and

01:55:59
I was considering to put another graph

01:56:01
that shows the increase of SUV sales and

01:56:03
really before 2015 it was this Market

01:56:06
hardly existed it really became uh a

01:56:09
thing in the last two years at least in

01:56:12
in Western Europe I think it was a

01:56:15
little bit different in Eastern Europe

01:56:16
and Russia Ukraine

01:56:18
[Music]

01:56:21
some cultural reasons also really bad

01:56:23
roads and a lot of rich people

01:56:27
um but um

01:56:30
okay but that seems that if you tune

01:56:32
into the mainstream culture if you show

01:56:34
TV and and advertising in between

01:56:36
programs the cars are still very much

01:56:38
there well maybe not regular cars but

01:56:40
more SUVs as you say

01:56:44
um

01:56:45
I think it's an interesting observation

01:56:47
anybody else has some some thoughts on

01:56:50
this or another things

01:56:54
[Music]

01:56:56
be yeah quite hard to uh prohibit the

01:57:01
advertisements if there's no uh real

01:57:04
alternative for the car for example in

01:57:08
in Flanders yeah there's an extreme

01:57:11
suburbanization and it's uh Mobility is

01:57:14
not

01:57:15
uh not that good to get to to different

01:57:19
places such as work or Leisure so yeah I

01:57:23
think first a better alternative for the

01:57:26
car needs to be installed

01:57:28
and and what is that alternative

01:57:31
yeah maybe better public transport

01:57:35
um safer also in cities but also in just

01:57:40
Town safer uh bicycle Lanes or yeah

01:57:47
and yes uh yeah car sharing more if not

01:57:52
really an alternative for cars it may be

01:57:54
less having each household having two

01:57:57
cars or three

01:58:00
um and in Belgium there's also the big

01:58:02
problem of

01:58:03
the the companies having giving cars to

01:58:08
their employees

01:58:10
uh which has spark debates a lot

01:58:14
yes in Belgium in fact most of new cars

01:58:18
being installed on so-called company

01:58:19
cars which uh

01:58:21
paid for by the I mean for those who

01:58:23
don't know who are not from Belgium

01:58:25
um

01:58:26
it's a system that allows you to get a

01:58:28
free car from your employer it's

01:58:30
basically a way of giving somebody a

01:58:32
salary bump because it's tax-free and

01:58:36
um bonus if you increase somebody's

01:58:38
salary they would have to pay tax on

01:58:40
this you don't pay a tax on the company

01:58:42
car

01:58:44
um

01:58:45
but then why do you think people uh well

01:58:48
because it seems that

01:58:50
I described some some kind of a shift of

01:58:52
thinking and some reflection on these

01:58:55
environmental problems that the

01:58:56
corporate uses and all the nuisances

01:58:58
that it causes but it seems that people

01:59:00
still drive why why do you think they

01:59:02
still do it

01:59:05
why is it still so popular

01:59:10
and maybe I can refer to this I think

01:59:13
there's like the

01:59:15
um exactly what you were talking about

01:59:17
before like

01:59:18
um certain

01:59:20
um

01:59:21
yeah so

01:59:24
factors which which cannot be

01:59:28
um

01:59:29
um somehow persist before like like

01:59:33
urban planners cannot

01:59:34
um no sorry

01:59:36
um like certain things you cannot plan

01:59:39
and like it's an individual approach

01:59:42
that the symbol of the car is still like

01:59:45
deep in the mind of a lot of people that

01:59:47
they it's like a day um routine that you

01:59:52
get into your car and drive to the to to

01:59:54
your working place and I think that's

01:59:58
exactly the problem that it's certain

02:00:01
um changes in the transportation system

02:00:03
cannot be made by other planners or

02:00:06
transport Transportation planners but

02:00:09
um have to be made in in in the society

02:00:13
or in the in symbolism of of a car so

02:00:17
it's a mindset it's a cultural

02:00:20
habitus sociologists would say it's a

02:00:23
way of imagining how we interact with uh

02:00:26
with the world or how we move through it

02:00:29
but I think the example of the company

02:00:30
car also shows that something else it's

02:00:33
not exclusive but it's also a policy

02:00:36
that there are a number of political

02:00:37
instruments that make it uh

02:00:40
I mean if we go with that uh

02:00:44
simplified logic of making a rational

02:00:47
economic choice uh how do I go and where

02:00:50
do I go it simply makes this decision

02:00:52
more more simple more rational it makes

02:00:55
sense to have a car from an economic

02:00:58
perspective as well in in many cities

02:01:00
still

02:01:03
um

02:01:06
yeah if I could maybe add to that also

02:01:09
that's structurally there is a lot of

02:01:11
government as well like policy support

02:01:13
not just like the company cars but as we

02:01:16
saw these days with the crisis I think

02:01:18
we try to boost like not to to allow our

02:01:22
automobile manufacturing automobile

02:01:24
companies

02:01:25
um Cromwell because of the employment

02:01:27
opportunities that they provide so

02:01:29
strangely enough actually some of the

02:01:31
financial

02:01:33
loss or some of the new

02:01:36
um funds for to stimulate the economy

02:01:39
have been directly towards I think

02:01:41
Individual Car ownership purchase of

02:01:44
different people so I think when you

02:01:47
when you see that it's

02:01:49
it's a big imperative a big push if if

02:01:53
you can have access to that as well yeah

02:01:56
I think same goes with Aviation I don't

02:01:58
know if you follow that on the news but

02:02:00
one of the first maybe not first but one

02:02:03
of the early discussions in terms of

02:02:04
some economic package for stimulating

02:02:08
the the economy in Belgium was towards

02:02:10
the the aviation companies the argument

02:02:13
being is that these industries create

02:02:14
jobs and these jobs are valuable

02:02:18
well

02:02:20
um I'm not saying whether this is right

02:02:21
or wrong

02:02:22
[Music]

02:02:23
but the argument is there that these

02:02:25
modes of Mobility also produce

02:02:27
employment

02:02:28
I think that relates a little bit to

02:02:30
this aspect of Economic Development this

02:02:32
anticipation that you know since this

02:02:34
way of moving around our cities or our

02:02:36
Societies in general uh is very

02:02:39
important for the economy to to to keep

02:02:42
growing to keep persisting

02:02:44
um

02:02:46
are there any other comments maybe from

02:02:47
some people who haven't spoken yet

02:02:50
you have some thoughts

02:02:52
some comments

02:02:55
um I was also thinking about security

02:02:56
like

02:02:58
um the the use of the car is still

02:03:01
um like yeah done by many because maybe

02:03:04
it's the last like it's the most secure

02:03:06
way of moving around in some cities and

02:03:09
also like I'm thinking and like as a

02:03:11
woman as a girl like moving around the

02:03:13
city at night usually like um I mean not

02:03:16
here in Brussels because I don't have a

02:03:17
car here in Brussels like back home

02:03:20
um I would go by car at night

02:03:23
um just because like

02:03:25
um yeah it's not very secure to move

02:03:27
around uh with like public transport or

02:03:30
even by bike so I would say like yeah

02:03:32
it's it's a matter of security as well

02:03:34
and

02:03:36
um it's more like a structural problem

02:03:39
uh to change so I guess more steps have

02:03:42
to be taken in that sense

02:03:44
yeah it's a very good point it existed

02:03:47
before the pandemic and now it's uh it's

02:03:50
become even more more of an issue so

02:03:53
early data uh shows us that uh

02:03:56
especially the upper middle class or

02:03:58
upper class people have uh have bought

02:04:00
themselves a new car to uh to separate

02:04:02
themselves from the from the danger of

02:04:05
interacting with others earlier this

02:04:07
danger would be related to maybe

02:04:08
criminality or general lack of safety

02:04:11
especially at night especially for women

02:04:14
perhaps but now this sense of danger and

02:04:17
the car is this kind of bubble that

02:04:18
allows you to separate yourself from

02:04:19
whatever danger Society holds it's it's

02:04:23
even stronger

02:04:25
[Music]

02:04:26
um

02:04:27
I think what's important also uh we will

02:04:30
talk about this a lot uh next time is

02:04:33
that this goes very differently for for

02:04:35
different people I mean it sounds very

02:04:37
obvious but uh whether you look at the

02:04:40
situation from a class perspective or

02:04:42
from a gender perspective or from a

02:04:43
racial perspective

02:04:45
I think all these three uh also age is

02:04:48
very important all these four then apply

02:04:50
in Brussels very much

02:04:51
uh the way that people arrive to a

02:04:54
decision in terms of why they go where

02:04:56
they go and how they go it's it's very

02:04:58
different from class to class from

02:05:00
gender to gender and

02:05:02
etc etc

02:05:04
so this homo economicus Paradigm is

02:05:07
extremely problematic there but so is I

02:05:11
hope I will convince you of that this uh

02:05:14
direct critique uh of the car because uh

02:05:18
different people use the car for

02:05:19
different reasons and not always it's a

02:05:22
individual choice but also there are

02:05:24
some structural issues at play uh also

02:05:28
indeed some cultural inertia some ways

02:05:32
of being that were installed and

02:05:34
promoted for decades which now we are or

02:05:38
some of us

02:05:39
living in City centers

02:05:41
are critical of but things have things

02:05:44
are quite different if you're uh from a

02:05:46
different class and living in different

02:05:47
areas of the city

02:05:50
um I don't mind taking one more or two

02:05:52
more questions but it's eight already so

02:05:54
we are very free to leave if you want to

02:05:56
I don't want to take too much of your

02:05:58
time

02:06:01
well

02:06:04
great

02:06:05
um I'm glad this is working from the

02:06:07
technical perspective at least

02:06:09
yeah I will uh I will see you next week

02:06:19
that we have program I know that in

02:06:22
covet times Well it's not happening but

02:06:25
no no I was I was told that uh yeah yeah

02:06:28
I was uh

02:06:30
was trying to do it but uh it's not

02:06:32
possible unfortunately I wish we could

02:06:34
and do it the idea is for those of you

02:06:36
who are in Brussels next semester but

02:06:37
all of you will be right

02:06:40
um

02:06:41
well

02:06:43
I mean

02:06:45
um let's say

02:06:46
[Music]

02:06:48
well we don't know of course what

02:06:49
happens in a few months but the idea is

02:06:51
that if in Spring we are more or less to

02:06:54
you know more into face-to-face meetings

02:06:57
than we do the Excursion then

02:06:58
we imagined with David bus and others

02:07:01
what would happen if we meet with 40

02:07:02
people and try to keep distance I think

02:07:05
this would uh you know we would hit

02:07:06
YouTube very quickly I think trying to

02:07:08
walk through the city in this

02:07:10
arrangement

02:07:11
so

02:07:12
no and also in December I mean it would

02:07:15
be very strange uh from my experience in

02:07:17
the end we would definitely try to keep

02:07:19
together just to keep warm it's it's

02:07:21
cold right so

02:07:24
um we will do that in Spring I hope it's

02:07:26
a nice Excursion uh from what I've heard

02:07:29
uh people usually enjoy it

02:07:31
um even though it's only about transport

02:07:34
but yeah uh

02:07:36
uh I'm sorry about that I wish I wish we

02:07:38
could do it yeah this is the reality

02:07:40
we're living in

02:07:44
um I hope you care of a great rest of

02:07:46
the week I'll see you all next week uh

02:07:48
the links are there so it seems that

02:07:50
everything is clear and working so

02:07:52
that's brilliant

02:07:54
um enjoy and have a good have a good

02:07:57
week

02:07:59
thank you for the like John thank you

02:08:01
very much

# 9 Critical perspectives on urban transport

00:00:00
should be recording automatically but

00:00:01
well it is now thanks for thanks for

00:00:05
reminding me so double rationality the

00:00:08
rationality of the discipline uh which

00:00:10
is taken as uh some kind of

00:00:15
um Fields deriving from Natural Sciences

00:00:19
alluding to laws of physics which

00:00:22
apparently help to understand where

00:00:24
people go how they move around the city

00:00:27
um and the rationality of the of the

00:00:30
people themselves of the users of

00:00:31
passengers drivers who make rational

00:00:34
economic choices in terms of where they

00:00:37
go how they go

00:00:38
how does this apply to the city uh well

00:00:41
basically the city's approach as a clean

00:00:44
slate so it's social political spatial

00:00:47
complexity it's seen if it is seen it's

00:00:51
seen as an obstacle to these principles

00:00:53
of rational planning

00:00:55
um if it's not seen then basically well

00:00:58
this planning is applied as if on a

00:01:01
clean slate

00:01:02
which

00:01:03
in this particular slide maybe this is a

00:01:05
bit of an exaggeration these are plans

00:01:06
from the cocusier who was really very

00:01:09
back then it was called bold or

00:01:11
courageous in terms of proposing to

00:01:14
actually demolish all's uh neighborhoods

00:01:17
or whole cities to to give way to this

00:01:19
rational modern planning

00:01:22
um but a lot of these planning

00:01:24
principles have been applied and I'm

00:01:25
sure that you've been to maybe even

00:01:27
lived in cities where

00:01:29
um whole neighborhoods if not whole

00:01:30
cities have been designed according to

00:01:32
this principle of rationality speed

00:01:34
modernity that of course focused on or

00:01:37
framed the car the private vehicle as

00:01:40
the ultimate most rational most

00:01:43
liberating mode of of Mobility mode of

00:01:46
transport

00:01:47
we also arrived last time to this

00:01:51
growing reflection starting from the

00:01:54
1970s and then through the 1980s and

00:01:57
1990s on many different problems related

00:02:00
to car and automobility so there's wider

00:02:03
social uh phenomenon related to to

00:02:07
massification and commodification of of

00:02:10
private cars

00:02:12
so a lot of social issues have been

00:02:14
raised and primarily environmental

00:02:16
issues have been raised with regards to

00:02:18
automobility with regard with regard to

00:02:20
the car and to be frank I think in a lot

00:02:25
of Transport debates whether in Academia

00:02:28
or an activism or in policy in Brussels

00:02:31
I think is quite apparent in many other

00:02:33
Belgian cities too this is where we are

00:02:35
this is still very much the dominant

00:02:37
Paradigm in terms of how policy is Being

00:02:40
Framed and how research is being done

00:02:42
Harris are considered to be something

00:02:44
detrimental to the quality of urban

00:02:45
space to a living

00:02:48
be it because of its environmental

00:02:50
impacts the pollution noise accidents

00:02:52
that it causes uh it's a very dangerous

00:02:55
mode of transport

00:02:56
for those of course who are outside of

00:02:58
the car and Clash collide with it or

00:03:02
it's spatial Footprints all right so the

00:03:04
the spatial uh impact of the the

00:03:06
infrastructure the amount of square

00:03:08
meters that have to be devoted to this

00:03:10
particular amount of Transport in order

00:03:11
for it to uh to be able to uh to move

00:03:15
around the city so I'm thinking here

00:03:16
about all the urban motorways the

00:03:18
parking lots Junctions and all that that

00:03:20
has to be present in the city for the

00:03:22
car to uh to be a a valid uh useful of

00:03:28
of moving around

00:03:30
so this is what we did last time

00:03:32
uh

00:03:33
a bit of an well not an interlude but

00:03:35
what happened also uh throughout the

00:03:38
1970s and 80s is that in the global

00:03:40
North at least in so-called developed

00:03:43
countries such as Belgium but also

00:03:45
across the pond in North America cities

00:03:48
have uh entered into a post-foldist era

00:03:51
and I'm sure this has been covered a lot

00:03:52
by David and probably a little bit by

00:03:54
Nick and here I'm going to focus much

00:03:56
more on the transport related impact of

00:03:58
that shift of course it was not

00:04:00
something that happened over a day and

00:04:02
it's difficult to tell or to pinpoint

00:04:05
when did for this cities

00:04:07
you know conclude the existence and and

00:04:10
we move to prosperity and it's more of a

00:04:12
longer process that happened over over a

00:04:14
long period of time at least at least

00:04:16
years if not decades but what's very

00:04:19
important there is that if you go back

00:04:21
to these um curves and that are somewhat

00:04:24
similar to contratives waves of

00:04:26
different Innovation waves uh 1960s 70s

00:04:30
and 80s brought first The Innovation and

00:04:32
then the massification the spread of ICT

00:04:35
technology so different modes of

00:04:37
different instruments of

00:04:39
telecommunications and also a big

00:04:42
development of Aviation of air which was

00:04:46
used both I mean of course it existed

00:04:48
already in 1930s 40s and 50s but it's in

00:04:51
the 1970s that it really became a common

00:04:54
or more common than ever way of for

00:04:57
people to move around to travel of

00:04:59
course not within the city but between

00:05:01
cities between countries and also to

00:05:03
move Goods so this really propelled uh

00:05:08
or gave constituted a really big step in

00:05:12
terms of globalizing both traffic of

00:05:14
people as and and of goods of trade

00:05:17
and that's coincided with a general

00:05:20
shift from industrial to service economy

00:05:23
ongoing supervisation of not only

00:05:26
housing but also a number of other

00:05:28
economic functions that were

00:05:30
traditionally related to memory course

00:05:31
also going to do the suburbs which

00:05:34
created a polycentric

00:05:37
mosaic-like patterns of suburbanization

00:05:39
so the suburbs were no longer these

00:05:41
residential areas from which people

00:05:43
commuted to the city center but actually

00:05:45
a lot of jobs a lot of productive

00:05:47
activity and service economy would start

00:05:50
being located in in the suburbs

00:05:52
themselves

00:05:53
uh so creating all kinds of

00:05:55
constellations which for example could

00:05:58
be called the Suburban downtowns or Edge

00:06:00
cities that comes from the work of

00:06:01
famous geographer and Soldier uh

00:06:03
analyzing the development of Los Angeles

00:06:05
in the 1980s and the 1990s

00:06:09
the Paradigm of this could be seen I

00:06:14
mean or the symbol not a paradigm of

00:06:16
this transformation could be seen in the

00:06:18
particular space or a type of space of

00:06:21
an airport if back in the 1970s as you

00:06:24
can see in this image the airport would

00:06:25
be a very functional Place uh a place of

00:06:28
arrival a departure and a rather small

00:06:31
area would be devoted to the airport

00:06:34
this over of course a number of decades

00:06:37
has completely changed so you see that

00:06:40
development of one of the most important

00:06:41
efforts in the world's Hip Roll which is

00:06:43
the airport of Amsterdam

00:06:46
uh what's very important here is that

00:06:48
the airport it's no longer an addition

00:06:50
to the city but actually increasingly a

00:06:53
central space around which or in

00:06:57
relation to which the city develops so

00:06:59
what kind of a city a city what kind of

00:07:01
an Oakwood city has uh has a

00:07:03
repercussions in terms of what kind of

00:07:05
class of investors and productive

00:07:07
activities it can attract to have an

00:07:09
importance in airport Hub is

00:07:12
increasingly only well it's already a

00:07:15
well-established point of the agenda of

00:07:16
open marketing of Urban Development

00:07:20
um and airports are no longer just

00:07:21
airports I mean you can see here in the

00:07:23
slide that around sleepwell we've got a

00:07:26
number of other activities so a business

00:07:27
district office spaces uh residential

00:07:31
Hotel so it is uh sort of neighborhood

00:07:35
in itself that is built around the the

00:07:38
airport

00:07:40
um itself

00:07:41
this is important why is it why is it is

00:07:44
important

00:07:45
well there was a number of things at

00:07:47
stake here but the most important thing

00:07:49
here is that this change of typology of

00:07:52
different spaces in relation to these

00:07:53
different modes of travel so coming into

00:07:56
telecommunications Aviation means that

00:07:59
the travel contents are becoming more

00:08:01
and more complex

00:08:03
um the globalization of world economy

00:08:05
and the centrality of the city and this

00:08:07
global economy means that there is a

00:08:10
number of productive activities jobs

00:08:12
basically that happen 24 7. it's the

00:08:16
Paradigm of going to uh I mean of most

00:08:18
people going to work at eight o'clock

00:08:20
nine o'clock in the morning and then

00:08:21
going back in the afternoon of course

00:08:23
it's a lot of people still do that but

00:08:25
there is plenty of jobs that happen

00:08:27
overnight that require

00:08:29
transport infrastructure that is

00:08:30
provided in places and at times that

00:08:34
we're not needed there was no demand for

00:08:36
in the past

00:08:38
so in our

00:08:39
in us this

00:08:41
making of those Urban economy more

00:08:44
flexible uh and more precarious has

00:08:46
repercussions in terms of making

00:08:48
transport and Mobility also much more

00:08:50
flexible or the demand for much more

00:08:52
flexible way of moving which of course

00:08:54
means that it's way more complicated and

00:08:56
way more difficult to design Transport

00:08:59
Systems than before since people move if

00:09:02
we can put it in a very blunt way in in

00:09:04
much more complicated ways than ever

00:09:05
before at very different times in a

00:09:07
different stasis just to give you an

00:09:09
example I mean traditionally

00:09:11
reserventence of the airport of Brussels

00:09:12
will be considered of course as a very

00:09:15
important space that'll have to be

00:09:17
connected to the city primarily to

00:09:19
receive passengers there and from and

00:09:21
increasingly a random area of the city

00:09:23
and I think you covered that with David

00:09:25
White's uh in quite in detail there's a

00:09:27
whole Hub of business and productive

00:09:29
activity which of course attracts a lot

00:09:32
of middle class workers who would go to

00:09:34
that area daytime but then the

00:09:37
development of ongoing development of

00:09:38
the city sorry of the airport means that

00:09:41
there is

00:09:42
um high demand for workers in logistics

00:09:44
for example who have to arrive at the

00:09:45
airport at three o'clock in the morning

00:09:47
which raises questions in terms of

00:09:49
provision of public transport through

00:09:50
that area a lot of these people would

00:09:52
for example reside in working-class

00:09:53
neighborhoods of Brussels

00:09:55
so

00:09:56
um there is a question with a nighttime

00:09:58
public transport should be provided to

00:10:00
that area

00:10:02
um but then and get a current Paradigm

00:10:03
of public transport by Time by night

00:10:05
time in Brussels this mode of Transport

00:10:08
is mostly provided for leisure

00:10:09
activities so for people who go out

00:10:12
enjoy cultural activities or socializing

00:10:14
and then want to go back home at two

00:10:16
o'clock three o'clock in the night but

00:10:18
not for people who actually need to

00:10:20
reach their their jobs at that time of

00:10:22
the of the night in very let's say weird

00:10:26
or previously not so present areas such

00:10:30
as the the savitem area or other

00:10:32
localities around us that hack okay

00:10:36
so having said this uh so a quick

00:10:41
reminder of what we did last time and a

00:10:43
quick

00:10:44
uh cover of this shift from for this to

00:10:47
post four days in Paradigm of uh of

00:10:49
Urban Development and its repercussions

00:10:50
for for the cities uh and and transport

00:10:54
in them

00:10:55
here's what we are going to do today so

00:10:57
we will discuss uh perhaps have a little

00:11:01
discussion actually I will be trying to

00:11:03
ask you some questions and engage in

00:11:04
some exchange here

00:11:06
what is the sustainable Urban transport

00:11:09
and different sustainable perspectives

00:11:11
on imagining transport and developing it

00:11:14
and then we will engage in a progressive

00:11:16
deconstruction of that Paradigm and

00:11:18
analyze what we can identify as critical

00:11:21
approaches to transported Mobility that

00:11:23
built on a number of perspectives that

00:11:24
you already heard from David and bass

00:11:28
and Nick about

00:11:31
all right last week what you had to do

00:11:34
and many other things that an article

00:11:36
you had to do as students of Master

00:11:37
nerve and studies and geography is to

00:11:39
read a paper by David bannister on on

00:11:42
sustainable Mobility paradigm

00:11:44
um I wonder where they used to remember

00:11:45
anything from that paper this is not an

00:11:47
exam so don't worry if you remember

00:11:49
things that were not exactly you know

00:11:51
um I mean what you remember isn't

00:11:53
exactly carry clear maybe things a

00:11:55
little bit fuzzy but

00:11:57
does something ring a bell from that

00:11:59
from that piece

00:12:00
um if you if somebody asked you today

00:12:02
before this particular lecture what is

00:12:04
sustainable Urban transport what comes

00:12:06
to mind does anybody want to uh want to

00:12:09
share their thoughts on this with us

00:12:17
that's called awkward silence

00:12:21
foreign

00:12:23
does anybody remember what banister says

00:12:25
in this paper

00:12:31
that's all right

00:12:35
okay well

00:12:39
it's not how to put it it's not the most

00:12:42
um fascinating paper I've ever read but

00:12:44
for transport geography it's absolutely

00:12:47
fundamental so this is really something

00:12:48
that

00:12:49
you see being referred to for when was

00:12:52
it written 2011 right so nine years in

00:12:56
this is still a very very important

00:12:58
piece of writing that really defined

00:13:01
almost a whole field of research and

00:13:04
transport and Mobility

00:13:06
what's important here and this is

00:13:09
important when we keep thinking about

00:13:11
the last lecture in the neoclassical

00:13:13
Paradigm of uh of developing transport

00:13:17
is well could be summarized in a number

00:13:20
of points so if you think about this uh

00:13:22
image that I showed you from the Corpus

00:13:24
here and this modernist rational

00:13:26
approach to planning cities around

00:13:28
transport or

00:13:31
here the assumption is that we have to

00:13:33
ultimately break with this

00:13:35
monofunctional planning separation of

00:13:37
functions keeping residential areas on

00:13:40
the one side and productive activity

00:13:42
jobs offices industrial activity on the

00:13:45
other side and then Leisure somewhere in

00:13:47
between these three in the in between

00:13:49
these two here the idea is that we

00:13:51
really have to engage in planning cities

00:13:55
that are much more mixed which different

00:13:57
functions are

00:13:59
allocated much more closely to each

00:14:01
other why do we have to do that well

00:14:03
because this increases the possibility

00:14:06
of of engaging Less in mobility of

00:14:09
basically in moving less in the in the

00:14:12
city which has of course very good

00:14:13
implications or potentially good

00:14:15
implications in terms of the

00:14:16
environmental impact of transform

00:14:18
so the idea is that if we make cities

00:14:20
more mixed in terms of the functions and

00:14:23
on top of that more dense we might

00:14:25
arrive at the situation in which people

00:14:27
don't have to travel such far distances

00:14:29
or they don't have to travel that often

00:14:30
and potentially and that's the second

00:14:33
point we can also facilitate some kind

00:14:35
of a shift from the mode that we all

00:14:38
want to disappear I mean I'm thinking as

00:14:41
a sustainable Urban transport planner

00:14:42
now so the car towards public transport

00:14:46
Collective Mobility on the one hand and

00:14:48
on the other hand

00:14:50
so-called soft transport mode so walking

00:14:52
cycling to profoundly Challenge and

00:14:55
hopefully end the domination of cars in

00:14:58
in cities like

00:15:00
so this is I mean goes beyond the

00:15:02
critique of the car uh how do we maybe

00:15:06
not get rid of the car but how limited

00:15:08
how do we limit its presence well we

00:15:10
make cities more dense more mixed and we

00:15:12
make public transport and other

00:15:14
different modes of of moving around more

00:15:16
attractive

00:15:17
well of course there are important

00:15:19
cultural and social barriers to this so

00:15:21
there is some kind of social inertia and

00:15:24
you mentioned it in our discussion at

00:15:25
the end of the last lecture people are

00:15:27
used to driving the they of course have

00:15:29
been also told for a couple of decades

00:15:31
now that uh I mean buying a car is

00:15:33
something not only perfectly normal but

00:15:35
maybe in context such as Belgium or

00:15:38
Brussels a perfectly rational choice

00:15:41
and also well if we follow the

00:15:43
neoclassical line I mean people make

00:15:45
rational economic choices uh so it's

00:15:48
been simply quite profitable and and

00:15:50
economically reasonable to have a car so

00:15:54
to instigate some kind of a social

00:15:56
transformation we need to pay more

00:15:58
attention to how people make these

00:16:00
choices and this perspective starts

00:16:02
adding a number of psychological

00:16:04
analysis for example and factors to this

00:16:06
to this equation so it's not only an

00:16:08
economic uh choice and some kind of an

00:16:11
economic decision that people make when

00:16:14
they take a car or some other amount of

00:16:15
Transport but there's also

00:16:18
um

00:16:18
different social aspects psychological

00:16:21
aspects that impact and make an impact

00:16:24
on this and this means that sustainable

00:16:26
Urban transport Scholars planners

00:16:28
activists are much more attentive than

00:16:31
the neoclassical colleagues in terms of

00:16:33
how people engage in different

00:16:35
Lifestyles why do they practice certain

00:16:37
travel behaviors it is called which also

00:16:40
leads to a lot of studies on inclusion

00:16:43
in transport or exclusion from it on

00:16:44
accessibility two different transport

00:16:47
modes or accessibility through transport

00:16:49
to different Urban functions which

00:16:52
progressively over the you know 1990s

00:16:55
2000s and up to today questions this

00:16:58
Paradigm of of seems to question this

00:17:00
Paradigm of top-down planning and and

00:17:02
policy so this figure of some

00:17:04
neoclassical rational expert is not

00:17:07
necessarily

00:17:08
um well it's still there but it's not

00:17:11
the only god-like figure that makes

00:17:13
these like decisions in terms of you

00:17:16
know here we will build a Motorway and

00:17:18
he will build some residential uh

00:17:20
neighborhood etc etc

00:17:23
where is the city in this in this

00:17:25
Paradigm or in this perspective

00:17:27
well the city is

00:17:30
um

00:17:32
an outcome of the sustainable transport

00:17:35
Paradigm it's a sustainable transport in

00:17:38
the sustainable city is is an in it's an

00:17:40
integral component

00:17:42
um of what uh what Jacob's called good

00:17:45
City on what David bannister in the

00:17:48
article you had to read uh identifies as

00:17:50
Urban viability vibrancy Vitality there

00:17:55
was a lot of uh words about a lot of um

00:17:59
writing about uh the the attractiveness

00:18:03
of the city or its livability or its

00:18:04
resilience that's a bit more recent so

00:18:07
there's a lot of keywords which identify

00:18:09
uh a city as

00:18:12
um

00:18:13
ultimate benefactor of the shift towards

00:18:15
sustainable transport so there is talk

00:18:17
about maintaining economic performance

00:18:20
of the city since well we remember that

00:18:21
neoclassical Scholars have essentially

00:18:24
tried to theorize this relationship

00:18:26
between economic growth and development

00:18:28
of Transport so it's still there we move

00:18:30
away from the car but the cities still

00:18:32
continue to develop the economies

00:18:34
continue to thrive we achieve social

00:18:36
cohesion so presumably everybody is on

00:18:39
board there is no Losers of this process

00:18:40
it's all of course environmentally

00:18:42
friendly we arrive at Urban environments

00:18:45
which provide Better Health environments

00:18:48
or facilities well not facilities but

00:18:50
are basically more healthy for the for

00:18:52
the residents and all this in the spirit

00:18:54
of participation so everybody is on

00:18:56
board and and

00:18:58
this political process does not exclude

00:19:01
anybody well if you think about this uh

00:19:04
I mean I'm no my intention is not to be

00:19:08
ironic here I think that

00:19:10
um by the way the slide I mean the image

00:19:12
here is from uh this visualization of uh

00:19:15
in Brussels so the central uh

00:19:18
Avenue that crosses the Pentagon from

00:19:21
north to south and if you remember how

00:19:23
this this street looked like some years

00:19:26
ago

00:19:27
um this kind of vision is something that

00:19:29
we might all you know want to subscribe

00:19:31
to I mean who doesn't want to live in a

00:19:33
city that is all these things

00:19:34
economically performing socially

00:19:36
cohesive environmentally friendly I mean

00:19:38
it's a perfect City it sees

00:19:40
um the problem is well before we move to

00:19:43
the problem

00:19:44
um there are a few

00:19:47
I'm sure that this rings a bell and I'm

00:19:49
sure that you know a lot of different

00:19:50
practices which are trying to policies

00:19:52
practices that are trying to achieve

00:19:55
these things to make the city more

00:19:56
environmentally friendly in terms of its

00:19:58
transport economically performance

00:20:00
inclusive cohesive and whatnot

00:20:04
it's what examples you know so this is

00:20:06
maybe an easy question to answer

00:20:08
compared to the previous one

00:20:10
does anybody know any practices of

00:20:13
sustainable transport basically is it my

00:20:15
question

00:20:20
because you can see that the

00:20:21
construction of bike lanes for example

00:20:25
yes very much so I mean it's a

00:20:28
promoting a different mode of Transport

00:20:31
than the cars right one of the soft

00:20:32
modes cycling so we absolutely yes

00:20:38
what else

00:20:42
I see it enter

00:20:45
um I'm living uh

00:20:47
here next to it about one kilometer of

00:20:50
the Opera in antrop

00:20:52
and um

00:20:54
two years ago it was uh

00:20:57
for um

00:20:59
passengers

00:21:01
very difficult to cross the roads and

00:21:04
now

00:21:05
um they made a tunnel

00:21:06
and they made a huge space for um carbon

00:21:10
transport and and passengers so

00:21:13
you can see now and then

00:21:16
a big difference

00:21:18
um clear division from from what's

00:21:22
what's usual until the 90s so you mean

00:21:26
that there was less space of well of the

00:21:30
car infrastructure

00:21:32
by public transport

00:21:36
yeah

00:21:38
the the car was was still

00:21:40
um like they say it was the boss

00:21:43
um right presence of the of the car was

00:21:46
was very important we seen our shift

00:21:49
there

00:21:50
and this shift basically consists of

00:21:54
creating some infrastructure for

00:21:55
pedestrians and public transports to

00:21:57
somehow public schools now for a meeting

00:22:00
place uh for the Opera okay okay

00:22:07
to this

00:22:10
um can you hear me yeah I just just

00:22:13
right before the lecture I I read about

00:22:15
Paris with a more

00:22:17
um restrictive policy about banning

00:22:20
um your parking spots in cities in in

00:22:23
order to achieve the 50 minutes uh City

00:22:26
the so-called so-called Fatima City yeah

00:22:29
right so restricting restricting car

00:22:32
infrastructure or transforming it into

00:22:34
different type of infrastructure for

00:22:36
either either different modes or for

00:22:39
pedestrians so creating some Urban space

00:22:41
okay

00:22:44
what else maybe developing both rapid

00:22:47
transits for example in America

00:22:50
yeah does everybody or is this somebody

00:22:52
who doesn't know what bus Rapid Transit

00:22:54
is

00:22:58
it's a funny question to ask to a screen

00:23:00
but oh no don't tell me that it's

00:23:02
switched again I have to stop sharing

00:23:05
your screen but perhaps you want to

00:23:07
explain what bus Rapid Transit is

00:23:09
because I'm sure that there is somebody

00:23:10
who doesn't know

00:23:12
I can help in case

00:23:15
your definition is not perfect well what

00:23:17
it has

00:23:18
yeah yeah you know what I have as an

00:23:21
example is these lanes that the just for

00:23:25
bosses so they're developer a rapid Lane

00:23:28
that it will only go for buses so it's

00:23:32
supposed to work better around the city

00:23:34
yeah

00:23:35
yeah it's essentially creating separate

00:23:38
lanes for for buses but what's quite

00:23:41
specific about this or quite particular

00:23:43
is that it's

00:23:44
um kind of imitates or replaces an

00:23:47
underground system so a Metro system

00:23:49
which

00:23:51
is of course very expensive to build so

00:23:53
the idea is that instead of engaging in

00:23:56
all this digging and creating this very

00:23:57
costly and an invasive infrastructure

00:24:00
you can just create some separate lanes

00:24:01
for the buses and have an efficient

00:24:04
public transport system which is Metro

00:24:05
like

00:24:06
and that's I want to say common but uh

00:24:09
well a lot of cases first emerge in in

00:24:12
the global South right so in South

00:24:14
America and then in South Africa

00:24:17
um but there are also cases in in global

00:24:19
North in Western Europe

00:24:21
okay there is a lot of these different

00:24:24
policies and a lot of different

00:24:26
um

00:24:27
a lot of different uh practices and

00:24:29
ideas it seems so let's quickly go over

00:24:33
I mean let's let's try to put them

00:24:36
together into some kind of coherent uh

00:24:38
typology of different things that cities

00:24:41
can do in order to make this transport

00:24:44
more sustainable so the first thing is

00:24:46
to tackle the problem right so if the

00:24:48
problem is the car then how do we deal

00:24:50
with the car well we can either improve

00:24:52
the technology of the car and this means

00:24:55
um reducing emissions making it

00:24:58
contaminate the air a little bit less so

00:25:01
cleaning the engine technology

00:25:02
substituting for of petrol diesel

00:25:06
vehicles by electric vehicles or biogas

00:25:08
or whatnot uh creating the con I mean

00:25:11
changing the construction of cars so

00:25:13
that they cause less casualties in in

00:25:16
case of accidents right so this is

00:25:18
something that today we take for granted

00:25:20
that cars have these um crash zones and

00:25:23
crashes are being done safety tests but

00:25:25
this was virtually non-existent in the

00:25:27
1970s or 80s

00:25:29
so that's one thing so basically it's

00:25:31
trying to make the car a better vehicle

00:25:32
for the city

00:25:34
well here in the immediate problem is

00:25:36
that I mentioned that last time uh among

00:25:39
the type of vehicles that see a number

00:25:42
of sales go up most I mean most rapidly

00:25:45
in last two or three years are SUVs so

00:25:48
the sports utility vehicles which are

00:25:50
basically these massive jeep-like uh

00:25:52
cars which are extremely dangerous for

00:25:54
pedestrians and if you also turn to one

00:25:57
of the most important or marketized

00:26:00
inventors of Transport technology Elon

00:26:03
Musk I mean it's a guy who does electric

00:26:05
cars but also if you paid attention to

00:26:07
that I don't know if you know if you

00:26:08
notice that in the news I think it was

00:26:10
early this year or last year that he

00:26:13
produced this massive truck uh like

00:26:16
American style you know pickup truck

00:26:17
which has not been tested in terms of

00:26:20
its impact on pedestrians in case it

00:26:22
actually clashes with one but there is

00:26:24
on the one hand the industry tries to

00:26:26
reinvent the vehicles to make them more

00:26:28
safe and environmentally friendly on the

00:26:30
other hand there is still a push for

00:26:32
creating gigantic vehicles with simply

00:26:34
cannot achieve that with the size and

00:26:37
the you know its audience or the

00:26:39
audience is not simply looking for this

00:26:41
okay so that's the car another thing

00:26:44
that of course can be done is uh to

00:26:46
restrict the accessibility for the car

00:26:48
uh to the to the city as a whole or to

00:26:51
its different

00:26:52
um areas specific zones right so we can

00:26:56
for example impose these restrictive

00:26:58
pricing instruments such as congestion

00:27:01
charging or Powers which was stolen in

00:27:05
Dutch which was very recently announced

00:27:07
in Brussels but it existed in in several

00:27:09
other

00:27:10
Belgian cities in one form or another

00:27:12
for for quite a while now

00:27:15
um we can think of reducing physically

00:27:17
the space for the car so basically

00:27:19
making uh roads more narrow so so

00:27:22
cutting some Lanes reducing the number

00:27:24
of parking areas and then uh as it was

00:27:28
mentioned uh earlier replacing this

00:27:30
infrastructure is replacing the space

00:27:32
with other users so opening this space

00:27:35
to for example pedestrians or

00:27:37
non-motorized traffic creating these

00:27:39
so-called pedestrian zones or shared

00:27:41
spaces and here you have one from London

00:27:44
in this slide and also the famous

00:27:47
congestion charging scheme in London

00:27:48
which means that in a specific Central

00:27:51
area of London you pay 12 pounds to

00:27:53
enter every time you you do that right

00:27:57
okay

00:27:58
what other things can be done to tackle

00:28:01
a lot of Mobility well of course if we

00:28:04
want the presence of the car to go down

00:28:06
we need to propose some alternative to

00:28:08
the car our obvious alternative is

00:28:10
public transport and here sustainable

00:28:13
perspectives on transport basically uh

00:28:15
keep emphasizing the importance of

00:28:17
increasing the quality of public

00:28:18
transport of increasing the

00:28:20
accessibility of public transport

00:28:22
across the urban or Suburban space and

00:28:25
indeed fast Rapid Transit is one common

00:28:28
example of how this can be done actually

00:28:30
quite inexpensively also the

00:28:33
reinstallation of urban trumps and many

00:28:35
cities in the global North that got rid

00:28:37
of the tram uh to create space for the

00:28:40
car if you remember my slice from from

00:28:42
last time that's what partly happened in

00:28:44
Brussels in the 1970s it's a very common

00:28:47
way it was a very common phenomenon

00:28:49
common phenomenon sorry in France where

00:28:52
a lot of cities Trump's Trump network

00:28:54
was quite simply dismantled so here

00:28:56
since the 1990s 2000s we see The Return

00:28:59
of the Trump Urban funicular so creating

00:29:02
these cable cars plenty of other modes

00:29:04
basically of public transport and also

00:29:06
promoting the notion

00:29:08
of multi-modality right so creating

00:29:10
different options for users so that they

00:29:12
don't have to Simply choose between the

00:29:15
car and something else but there's

00:29:16
something else is a variety of different

00:29:18
options from which one can choose and

00:29:21
depending on where they go with whom

00:29:22
what they feel uh like like using in a

00:29:26
particular moment of time what

00:29:27
corresponds better to the behavior do

00:29:30
they to their lifestyle right if we if

00:29:32
the lifestyle and behavior is what we

00:29:33
pay attention to much more than before

00:29:38
um and then finally what's important in

00:29:42
this portfolio of different solutions or

00:29:45
tools if you will is reducing the need

00:29:47
to travel right so I mentioned already

00:29:48
that here the idea is that we make

00:29:51
cities more dense more mixed so perhaps

00:29:54
we don't have to travel so often and so

00:29:56
far

00:29:59
and in planning or in geography the idea

00:30:02
here is to progressively link Urban

00:30:05
Development with transport development

00:30:07
so the idea of Transit Oriental

00:30:09
transport oriented development

00:30:10
emerged within this Paradigm so for

00:30:13
example fostering some activities some

00:30:16
development around the development of

00:30:17
new Metro stations or Railway stations

00:30:19
or whole transport corridors a little

00:30:22
bit like what I showed you last time

00:30:23
with Copenhagen right the finger the

00:30:25
five finger plant which was one of the

00:30:27
first ideas of linking transport

00:30:30
development and Urban Development

00:30:33
um and many other things that's well

00:30:34
quite frankly I'm much more interested

00:30:37
in in sharing with you the critique of

00:30:39
all this than than this itself because

00:30:41
this is very easy to find and there's

00:30:44
plenty of different Publications on this

00:30:46
I mean basically if you follow any of

00:30:49
these uh websites which deal with or

00:30:51
well these are called magazines these

00:30:53
days that follow uh Urban policy City

00:30:56
lab the Atlantic fox or whatnot I'm sure

00:30:59
that you know more than I do I mean this

00:31:01
is what they say I mean this is what

00:31:02
they promote a lot right so the car is

00:31:05
the problem so anytime a big Northern

00:31:09
also in the global South uh this is

00:31:11
picked up a little bit but anytime any

00:31:13
important city does something in terms

00:31:15
of curbing automobility

00:31:18
um this is very often picked up by this

00:31:20
kind of media and hails as a radical

00:31:23
intervention as a radical step to to

00:31:26
reinvent Humanity to give cities back to

00:31:28
the people to make cities more

00:31:30
sustainable green attractive and etc etc

00:31:33
now I'm not saying that this is all bad

00:31:35
and that this is uh you know problematic

00:31:38
in itself but there is a number of

00:31:39
critical questions that answers critical

00:31:41
geographers really need to be asking

00:31:43
about these practices because they quite

00:31:45
simply

00:31:46
um well they are they are not really

00:31:48
taking full stock of the complexity of

00:31:50
cities that they're being applied in

00:31:52
for one

00:31:54
so

00:31:55
um well the first immediate problem is

00:31:58
that the word sustainability or the term

00:32:01
sustainability has already been picked

00:32:03
up by the industry the Paradigm that

00:32:07
sustainability in principle wanted to to

00:32:11
criticize and to have some critical

00:32:13
Cutting Edge over

00:32:15
so for instance the the oil industry and

00:32:20
the car industry both claim to be

00:32:22
extremely sustainable these days right

00:32:24
in terms of how they produce soil and in

00:32:26
terms of how they produce vehicles I

00:32:28
mentioned already this idea of

00:32:29
Reinventing the car so it's a more

00:32:31
sustainable mode of travel in in cities

00:32:34
but the deeper problem is that

00:32:37
and I will show that in a moment that

00:32:39
the kind of questions that sustainable

00:32:41
Urban paradigm

00:32:43
um asks about the city and the solutions

00:32:45
that it tries to bring are essentially I

00:32:48
mean they can only reveal some transport

00:32:51
reality to a point so it's very quick I

00:32:54
think that we can reach some kind of a

00:32:56
wall

00:32:57
um and this debate between let's say the

00:33:00
neoclassical engineers and economists

00:33:02
and the anti-car proponents of

00:33:05
sustainable vanities it's not a very

00:33:07
productive one

00:33:09
and very importantly for this course and

00:33:11
for you is I don't know Urban

00:33:13
geographers urban planners of the future

00:33:15
the relation between transport and the

00:33:17
urban in this debate is very it's very

00:33:19
weak so conceptually but also

00:33:22
empirically

00:33:23
um this kind of thinking about

00:33:25
transported Mobility simply does not

00:33:27
tell us a lot I think about the city

00:33:29
which is why we're here two nights

00:33:33
right so so let's deconstruct it and

00:33:35
explore some critical stuff about it

00:33:38
basically so

00:33:41
I wonder whether you can already pick up

00:33:43
some critique of this from Elena and her

00:33:46
colleague

00:33:49
I'll be starving with the readings today

00:33:53
does anybody remember something from the

00:33:55
reading for today

00:33:59
um I do

00:34:00
it's been a week since I read it

00:34:03
but uh

00:34:06
um I know that she uh has like

00:34:09
identified two main principles of

00:34:13
critique

00:34:14
which is first that the Alternatives

00:34:17
that are being proposed by um the

00:34:21
automobile industry and no specific

00:34:24
plans they are not very

00:34:26
like sufficient in reducing the uh out

00:34:30
to mobile impact

00:34:33
um in in certain cases you can you can

00:34:37
say if I uh say something wrong and then

00:34:39
secondly

00:34:42
um

00:34:44
well it's it's sort of a very exclusive

00:34:47
uh sometimes discussion I think but uh

00:34:50
yeah it's not very present anymore but I

00:34:53
would like to pose another question for

00:34:55
that paper it kind of upset me in a way

00:34:58
oh yeah

00:35:04
yeah if we're at it like uh I basically

00:35:08
I liked her way of like introducing her

00:35:11
thoughts and like structuring the paper

00:35:13
but I was a bit like put off just uh

00:35:17
methodologically uh in the way that she

00:35:21
uh links empirical evidence that she

00:35:27
produced herself to theory that is

00:35:31
oftentimes very theoretical and like

00:35:36
um based on uh very uh personal beliefs

00:35:41
and attitudes which I like also support

00:35:45
in a way but sometimes I found that did

00:35:48
make her arguments less striking and I

00:35:51
was just wondering because we are like

00:35:52
still in the beginning of all of our

00:35:54
like uh Urban critical research careers

00:35:58
uh how that is to be done

00:36:04
uh

00:36:05
if you have an answer to that

00:36:08
I don't know I mean I don't have an

00:36:10
answer to that question

00:36:13
um well I would agree with you that

00:36:15
maybe methodologically this is not the

00:36:16
strongest paper uh it's an analysis of

00:36:19
plans and it's not very clear exactly

00:36:21
what she's maybe done with this and

00:36:22
maybe it's true that her conviction is a

00:36:25
little bit stronger than her empirics in

00:36:26
this particular paper

00:36:28
um I picked it because it summarizes a

00:36:31
few things a little bit better than than

00:36:33
others but I really like what she what

00:36:36
she what she does even though the best

00:36:38
work that she's done is in French I

00:36:40
think which makes it not accessible to

00:36:43
everybody here

00:36:45
um

00:36:46
but yeah I think your first point in

00:36:47
terms of what's you know what's in the

00:36:49
article it's it's spot on it's also

00:36:52
there in the title I mean uh she may be

00:36:55
uh it's again she risks uh being maybe a

00:36:58
little bit uh engaging in some kind of

00:37:00
exaggeration right it's not every single

00:37:03
sustainable Urban transport policy that

00:37:05
leads to the processes that she

00:37:07
describes but there is a tendency for

00:37:10
these policies to create some

00:37:12
inequalities

00:37:13
and for the politicizing the debate

00:37:16
so um it's not exactly clear who these

00:37:20
policies are supposed to be for they are

00:37:23
these obvious a little bit again in this

00:37:26
kind of neoclassical uh Direction

00:37:28
rational tools of now dealing with uh

00:37:32
with the car is the problem right so in

00:37:35
fact the power relations in transport or

00:37:37
in transport policy have not really

00:37:38
changed is just that the focus has

00:37:41
shifted significantly and now

00:37:44
um this is what the planners are doing

00:37:45
as opposed to what they were doing in

00:37:47
the 1970s and 80s

00:37:51
um let's dive into this

00:37:53
whoops uh great so what are the and

00:37:57
that's my um individual of how to put it

00:38:00
my personal top five of the reasons why

00:38:03
sustainable Urban transport Paradigm is

00:38:05
not exactly the the you know doesn't

00:38:08
give you a complete view of the

00:38:10
relationship between transport and the

00:38:11
and the city and and also with some I

00:38:14
think quite practical theoretical

00:38:17
empirical uh recipes for how to get out

00:38:20
of this uh roadblock pan unintended so

00:38:25
the first issue with with a lot of the

00:38:27
riding on sustainability is that it's

00:38:29
still very much focused on technology

00:38:31
so there is a lot of attention given to

00:38:33
technological solutions where social and

00:38:35
political Innovations and some bottom up

00:38:38
political activity organization

00:38:41
engagement of people as political agents

00:38:44
not just the consumers and customers

00:38:47
that have to be now convinced to shift

00:38:49
from one mode to another from the car to

00:38:51
something else this is not so present

00:38:53
and uh well this comes from the from the

00:38:57
guru himself Elon Musk who is um despite

00:39:00
of course some obvious critique it was

00:39:02
his personality and and how he carries

00:39:05
himself in media he still is

00:39:07
um very much the hope for many in terms

00:39:11
of transitioning from carbon heavy modes

00:39:15
of Mobility to electric vehicles which

00:39:17
according to the industrial are the

00:39:18
thing of the future so according to Elon

00:39:20
Musk

00:39:22
um as he says I think public transport

00:39:24
is painful it sucks why do you want to

00:39:26
get on something with a lot of other

00:39:27
people that doesn't leave where you

00:39:29
wanted to leave doesn't start where you

00:39:30
want it to start doesn't air doesn't end

00:39:33
where you want it to end it's a pain in

00:39:35
the ass and so that's why people like

00:39:37
individualized transport that goes where

00:39:39
you want and when you want

00:39:40
so the idea idea is not to engage in

00:39:45
collectivizing transport for example and

00:39:46
making this a more common service or a

00:39:50
more common experience to break not only

00:39:52
the Paradigm of dependency on fossil

00:39:54
fuels and the car but the dependency on

00:39:57
individual transport making this

00:39:58
basically a less individual activity

00:40:01
which is a social political activity as

00:40:04
well no to the country here the idea is

00:40:06
to develop a better technology within

00:40:08
the Paranormal individual transport and

00:40:10
Elon Musk I mean he's doing a lot of

00:40:12
things but one of the other things in

00:40:15
Tesla and the produced production of

00:40:17
electric vehicles that he does is

00:40:20
um boring tunnels on the Los Angeles to

00:40:22
basically create some parallel Motorway

00:40:25
system if we can call it this way that

00:40:27
bypasses congestion so actually the

00:40:30
focus here while

00:40:32
um might apparently be on making trans

00:40:34
more sustainable it is essentially to

00:40:37
solve congestion which is an extremely

00:40:38
as I explained last time neoclastical

00:40:40
formulation of the problem

00:40:43
another issue and that's from Elena's

00:40:47
paper and but I think it's not from the

00:40:49
one that you had to read for today but

00:40:51
from another thing that I that I learned

00:40:53
from here is this focus on on

00:40:58
the individual as the not only well how

00:41:02
to put it not only is the source of a

00:41:04
number of Transport problems but also as

00:41:07
a as a solution to to address these

00:41:09
problems right so

00:41:10
the idea here is that essentially we can

00:41:14
convince people to change the habits to

00:41:17
change the lifestyle related to

00:41:19
transported mobility and in this way we

00:41:22
can solve a number of issues related to

00:41:23
to this uh to this field of of open

00:41:27
Planning of urban policies

00:41:30
um

00:41:31
which means that within the sustainable

00:41:34
Paradigm

00:41:36
um a lot of policy makers a lot of

00:41:38
Transport stakeholders would uh rather

00:41:40
than engage in the politics of Transport

00:41:42
they would engage on the pedagogy that's

00:41:44
related to it so it's suddenly the

00:41:48
challenge is to make sure that people

00:41:50
engage Less in behavior that is

00:41:53
identified as bad behavior for example

00:41:55
driving or living in the suburbs flying

00:41:58
around and switching to what is

00:42:01
considered to be good type of behavior

00:42:03
positive behavior so cycling around

00:42:05
walking living in a city center living

00:42:08
in these dense mixed urban areas that

00:42:11
don't require that you engage in

00:42:13
mobility and so much

00:42:16
and while this of course is not a

00:42:17
problem in itself I mean it's good to

00:42:19
think of why would people

00:42:23
um stick to particular ways of moving

00:42:25
what's very uh detrimental I think to

00:42:28
the debate and to ultimately solving

00:42:30
some issues related to transport

00:42:32
is

00:42:33
um putting these different ways of

00:42:36
moving and different behaviors related

00:42:37
to movement in a coyote where clearly

00:42:40
there is a moral component so this good

00:42:43
and bad behavior I think this is

00:42:44
something that can actually antagonize

00:42:47
people against one another rather than

00:42:48
try to think of Transport problems as

00:42:51
common societal problems thus issue

00:42:54
number one and issue number two is that

00:42:56
in this discussion about individual

00:42:58
behavior

00:43:00
um engagement with analyzing and then

00:43:02
ultimately addressing structural causes

00:43:04
behind behind transport and Mobility is

00:43:06
not so present so if we focus on on the

00:43:09
question why would people drive

00:43:11
um and why would people of for example

00:43:13
even specific ethnicity or gender or

00:43:16
class drive more than others

00:43:19
um it is very important to also

00:43:20
understand what is the structure uh

00:43:22
behind this what is the the general

00:43:24
policy that allows people to obtain

00:43:26
access to uh to a vehicle that allows

00:43:29
that are of car infrastructure which

00:43:32
very often and that's the case

00:43:33
definitely in Belgium it's often

00:43:35
absolutely free to use with no taxes to

00:43:38
to use motorways or with cheap parking

00:43:42
etc etc

00:43:43
so this perspective is

00:43:46
um in itself not a problem to look at

00:43:49
you know why people engage in particular

00:43:51
type of behavior and not other

00:43:53
um but it's very important to also

00:43:54
understand the structures behind this

00:43:58
what Elena also writes a lot about and

00:44:01
many others as well but as I said I'm

00:44:04
really quite convinced by by her writing

00:44:08
um

00:44:09
is the uneven geography that is being

00:44:11
produced by these different uh

00:44:14
Sustainable Solutions

00:44:19
somebody's asking a question in the chat

00:44:22
so let me read that so maybe there's

00:44:23
something in between for example

00:44:25
self-driving cars and apps like uber

00:44:28
um will be able to create smaller

00:44:30
vehicles that can be shared as public

00:44:31
transport so in a sense in between but

00:44:34
in between of

00:44:36
in between what

00:44:38
and between private uh I mean including

00:44:40
individual transport and Collective

00:44:43
transport you mean

00:44:45
Rudy do you want to explain whoever you

00:44:48
are

00:44:49
foreign

00:44:55
hello

00:44:56
Rudy are you with us

00:44:59
I hope you didn't just write the comment

00:45:00
and left

00:45:01
maybe the connection is not very good on

00:45:04
your end

00:45:05
um

00:45:07
well yeah I mean clearly in in recent

00:45:10
years there's been a rise of uh of

00:45:12
expectations towards this shared

00:45:14
Mobility modes right so so a number of

00:45:16
practices which allow you to get access

00:45:19
to seemingly collectivized transport

00:45:21
like uber I mean essentially you don't

00:45:23
own the vehicle but it's just a not even

00:45:26
a phone call but a tap on your phone

00:45:27
away

00:45:29
um

00:45:31
but there is a number of uh there's a

00:45:33
number of issues with this so there's a

00:45:35
question whether this actually replaces

00:45:37
uh individual transport

00:45:40
um so do people have less cars because

00:45:42
Uber is expanding in this city if we're

00:45:44
focusing on Uber in this instance

00:45:47
um there is also a lot of studies that

00:45:49
show that Uber actually adds to

00:45:50
congestion so there is the more Uber

00:45:53
develops in the city or it's

00:45:55
um counterparts or different other

00:45:57
competitive platforms left in China

00:46:00
there was a huge company called DD that

00:46:02
essentially does what Uber does

00:46:05
um so the more these companies develop

00:46:07
in your city the more the how do you

00:46:11
call it well the total number of

00:46:12
vehicles the the car stock increases

00:46:15
which means and that's a problem in a

00:46:17
lot of Chinese cities you basically have

00:46:19
more traffic jams so these cars are in

00:46:22
traffic all the time they keep looking

00:46:24
for customers they have to be mobile

00:46:26
um which means that you add to the

00:46:28
problem you try yourself which well then

00:46:30
you try to yourself again adding more to

00:46:33
these shared platforms

00:46:35
and also the big issue with Uber if we

00:46:37
are focusing on this for a moment is

00:46:40
that the working conditions of course

00:46:41
are quite quite terrible so the idea

00:46:44
there is that essentially there are

00:46:46
exceptions to this but in most cities

00:46:48
where Uber operates

00:46:50
um workers are not really workers

00:46:51
they're contractors

00:46:53
which means that they very often go in

00:46:56
debt to actually get the vehicle that

00:46:57
they're driving that they have to pay

00:46:59
back to Uber because it's offering also

00:47:01
leasing services this means that they

00:47:03
work very long hours unlike regular taxi

00:47:07
drivers that have to actually clock in

00:47:09
and out this is much more regulated in

00:47:11
terms of how they work for what amount

00:47:14
of time and also what knowledge of the

00:47:16
city they have I don't know how often

00:47:18
you've taken Uber in your life but it's

00:47:20
often the case that these drivers are

00:47:23
exploring the city alone I mean they

00:47:25
just learn as they as they drive which I

00:47:28
understand they might come from a very

00:47:30
difficult situation that this is the

00:47:31
only way for them to get access to a

00:47:33
more or less decent way of making money

00:47:37
but there's a question of safety there's

00:47:39
a question of Ethics in terms of

00:47:42
um inviting such a practice in in our

00:47:44
cities

00:47:45
so there are a lot of expectations for

00:47:47
these platforms and indeed there is a

00:47:49
question does this maybe sit between

00:47:52
public transport Collective transport

00:47:53
and individual transport but uh

00:47:56
um I would say that these hopes are

00:47:58
still not really fulfilled

00:48:00
um

00:48:01
okay that was a bit of the digression

00:48:03
let's go back to uneven geography of

00:48:05
sustainable transport

00:48:06
so what is the problem here

00:48:09
um more often than not the application

00:48:11
of the sustainable tools different

00:48:14
policies infrastructural measures to

00:48:17
deal with Mobility

00:48:20
uh especially quite exclusive what does

00:48:23
it mean well

00:48:25
on the one hand it often happens that a

00:48:28
lot of these measures are applied in a

00:48:29
specific area of the city and more often

00:48:31
than not this is the central Urban core

00:48:33
which has to be saved from the car in

00:48:36
which the the car has to limit its

00:48:39
presence which in no way contradicts uh

00:48:42
or prevents further maintenance at least

00:48:45
if not developing a further

00:48:47
infrastructure for the cars in more

00:48:48
peripheral areas so you can think of

00:48:51
cities in which in the city center

00:48:52
you've got

00:48:54
um restrictive parking regulations

00:48:56
you've got a lot of pedestrian areas

00:48:58
it's simply not easy to drive around

00:49:00
public transport is definitely a more

00:49:02
logical thing to to do to use to get

00:49:05
into but the further you go to the

00:49:07
suburbs the more

00:49:08
um

00:49:09
multi-lane streets or highways you see

00:49:11
or actual proper highways a lot of

00:49:13
parking lots all the infrastructure that

00:49:16
actually well belongs to the 1970s and

00:49:18
1980s

00:49:20
and that is I think a situation not only

00:49:23
in Belgium or and Brussels specifically

00:49:25
but

00:49:26
in a lot of these cities that are

00:49:28
supposedly

00:49:29
have achieved um a great level of of

00:49:33
policy in terms of dealing with with

00:49:34
Khan so Copenhagen Vienna a lot of

00:49:38
French cities that both these uh tram

00:49:41
renewal programs uh as long as you are

00:49:44
in the central part of the city this all

00:49:46
looks uh very coherent and very well

00:49:49
inverted Commerce good from a

00:49:51
sustainable transport perspective but

00:49:53
the farther you go from the city center

00:49:54
the more actually the more cars you see

00:49:56
the more it actually resembles the

00:49:58
problem that these policies try to try

00:50:00
to solve

00:50:01
another inequality is of the vertical

00:50:04
kind meaning that it often happens that

00:50:08
um

00:50:08
the investment in these kind of

00:50:10
sustainable tools comes at the cost of

00:50:12
putting the car infrastructure

00:50:14
underground so and you can think of any

00:50:18
case in which pedestrialization of of an

00:50:20
urban Avenue or Boulevard means that the

00:50:23
cars have to be put underground or

00:50:25
parking lots of the other highways

00:50:27
and this is often the the problem in in

00:50:30
the so-called car-free cities the cities

00:50:33
that are often picked up by

00:50:34
International media and and praised for

00:50:37
having addressed head-on the domination

00:50:39
of the cars and dealt with the problem

00:50:41
of automobility

00:50:44
um

00:50:45
a specific tool that's that I think we

00:50:49
can see this and even geography in ah

00:50:51
there's a question in the chat an

00:50:54
example for Rudy's question from Berlin

00:50:56
great

00:50:57
um let me go on with the congestion

00:50:58
charging while you're discussing Uber in

00:51:00
the chat uh this is perfectly allowed so

00:51:04
an example of this and even geography

00:51:06
can be found in in congestion charging

00:51:08
which is one of the let's say

00:51:11
um yeah one of the most uh classical

00:51:13
tools of of sustainable transport

00:51:16
Paradigm in terms of you know limiting

00:51:17
the presence of the cars the idea is

00:51:19
simple it came from Singapore in the

00:51:22
1970s it was developed as a very

00:51:24
neoclassical uh tool of planning

00:51:26
basically a problem with congestion and

00:51:29
the idea was to convince to encourage

00:51:31
drivers to use the car off-peak so to

00:51:34
minimize the the traffic the traffic

00:51:36
jams in morning and and afternoon or

00:51:39
evening peak hours

00:51:41
and progressively this tool or perhaps

00:51:45
with the shift of philosophy behind

00:51:47
transport from the neoclassical to

00:51:48
sustainable uh perspectives this tool

00:51:52
um was picked up by by the sustainable

00:51:54
narrative and now it not only allows to

00:51:56
solve congestion but actually it allows

00:51:58
to limit the presence of the car in the

00:52:00
city which of course supposedly makes a

00:52:02
positive impact on on the urban

00:52:04
environment

00:52:05
and this tool has been put in place in

00:52:07
in a number of cities in Europe

00:52:09
so you here see pictures from Oslo but

00:52:12
actually this exists in pretty much all

00:52:15
uh Norwegian cities and towns so a

00:52:18
system of tolling Gates

00:52:20
um in London which is probably the most

00:52:22
important or the most known case in

00:52:24
Europe in Milan but you also have

00:52:27
similar policies and instruments in

00:52:29
Stockholm in Sweden and then recently

00:52:32
also in Brussels announced with a lot of

00:52:34
pump and Circumstance this idea that now

00:52:37
it will cost the user the end user money

00:52:40
to enter with a car Mica to to the

00:52:44
Brussels capital region

00:52:45
so

00:52:47
while this gets a lot of attention and

00:52:50
and this policy is discussed as a very

00:52:52
uh as a very efficient uh tool in terms

00:52:57
of limiting the presence of the car in

00:52:58
cities

00:53:01
um there is questionable evidence I'm

00:53:03
not saying that this policy is uh is is

00:53:05
a bad policy or that it never works but

00:53:07
basically it's it's supposed to uh

00:53:11
um productive results in terms of

00:53:13
limiting the car are not exactly there

00:53:16
in the in the in the in the evidence so

00:53:19
the results are quite mixed on the one

00:53:21
hand we see that in in a number of

00:53:23
Cities traffic of course diminishes but

00:53:25
since it's The delimited Zone it's it's

00:53:28
quite particular so it's not the whole

00:53:31
agglomeration that actually

00:53:33
um has the access to the car limited we

00:53:35
see that the traffic often moves from of

00:53:39
course the The Zone in which the

00:53:41
condition charging the flight to the

00:53:42
outer areas in London for instance it's

00:53:44
quite clear that there is significantly

00:53:46
more traffic around that that zone it's

00:53:49
the same case in Madrid which uh which

00:53:52
um essentially followed a very similar

00:53:53
principle

00:53:54
there is also very questionable evidence

00:53:57
about what happens with the funds that

00:53:59
are being raised through these systems

00:54:00
so while very often these policies are

00:54:02
put in place with uh this Narrative of

00:54:05
saving the city from the car of making

00:54:07
some kind of societal transition to to

00:54:09
posca society in cities like Oslo or

00:54:13
London funds from these uh from these

00:54:16
schemes in in a way that's very clear in

00:54:18
London maybe a little bit less

00:54:19
transparent but at least part of these

00:54:21
fans goes to actually maintenance and

00:54:23
construction of car infrastructure you

00:54:25
know it's very it's a very common

00:54:26
practice to put these congestion

00:54:28
charging areas or

00:54:31
booths if you if you will to actually

00:54:33
subsidize the construction of of

00:54:35
specific uh transport infrastructure

00:54:37
Road tunnel or a bridge it's it's done

00:54:40
in a very transparent way so in a sense

00:54:42
it's basically asking the transport the

00:54:44
car user to

00:54:46
contribute a little bit more because of

00:54:48
course this contribution is already

00:54:49
there through tax system to the

00:54:51
construction uh to the financing of the

00:54:54
construction of Transport infrastructure

00:54:55
of cutting in car infrastructure and

00:54:58
finally the impact of these uh of these

00:55:01
schemes on overall quality of the city

00:55:04
not just on air quality in a specific

00:55:07
area is quite limited so

00:55:10
um

00:55:11
yeah I said it basically so despite the

00:55:14
The Narrative of of these practices

00:55:16
saving Urban environment it's not

00:55:18
exactly clear that this is this is the

00:55:20
most obvious thing to do to limit the

00:55:22
smog in the city especially when these

00:55:24
uh when these areas are quite uh

00:55:26
spatially Limited

00:55:29
the problems that immediately emerge

00:55:31
from from policies like congestion

00:55:33
charting is that well it leads to some

00:55:36
social segregation right so we expect

00:55:39
um that all people react to this uh to

00:55:42
this policy in a similar way right they

00:55:44
will reconsider whether they want to

00:55:45
drive or not whether they want to enter

00:55:47
into the Zone by car or not but in fact

00:55:49
of course those who do not pay for the

00:55:52
vehicle and in particular in Belgium

00:55:54
this is a policy that is very widespread

00:55:57
half of new vehicles sold in Belgium are

00:56:00
so-called company cars which are

00:56:01
received for free by employees from the

00:56:03
company as a way of giving them an

00:56:06
tax-free salary bonus basically so for

00:56:09
these people who do not pay for the

00:56:11
vehicle itself and often whose

00:56:12
consumption of the vehicle gas so or any

00:56:16
kind of fuel they put in the car

00:56:17
insurance this is all paid by the

00:56:19
company very often this very often

00:56:21
basically is included in the package so

00:56:23
the congestion charging is actually not

00:56:24
covered by the individual it's covered

00:56:26
by the structure that provides the

00:56:28
vehicle

00:56:30
um in in the first place

00:56:32
while of course those who do not have a

00:56:34
job who might be seeking one those who

00:56:37
are from lower working class background

00:56:40
who might also be doing very difficult

00:56:43
complicated irregular trips that require

00:56:47
entering and leaving in different times

00:56:48
of day because they need to go to a job

00:56:51
that that quite simply requires getting

00:56:53
by car and I'm going back here to this

00:56:56
example of somebody working in logistics

00:56:58
public transport between molenberg or

00:57:01
zavendam for example at three o'clock in

00:57:03
the morning being simply not there you

00:57:05
have to have a car to to reach this kind

00:57:07
of activity to to be able to access the

00:57:10
kind of urban function

00:57:13
and then ultimately well what it does to

00:57:15
uh to to Mobility is commodified so it's

00:57:19
an essentially neoliberal service you

00:57:22
pay as much as you use it's not a common

00:57:25
system anymore you the idea is that

00:57:28
everybody pays not according to the

00:57:30
means but according to the ultimately

00:57:33
um the price decided by the by the

00:57:35
market

00:57:36
so

00:57:38
um again not to say that this is about a

00:57:40
good idea but to say that there is quite

00:57:42
simply a lot of questions a lot of them

00:57:44
quite clearly related to to critical

00:57:47
geography that should be asked about

00:57:48
these these policies

00:57:50
it's already past seven so I suggest we

00:57:52
take at least five minute break before

00:57:54
we can continue so get a little bit of a

00:57:56
drink uh whatever it is that you are

00:57:58
you're sipping to make through this

00:58:00
lecture

00:58:02
um and I'll see you back in in four five

00:58:04
minutes all right

00:58:09
foreign

01:03:36
foreign

01:03:38
okay let's try to resume

01:03:41
I'm going to share my screen once again

01:03:56
all right

01:03:59
where are we

01:04:02
all right

01:04:09
I suppose you hear me and you see me

01:04:12
um

01:04:13
great perfect so

01:04:16
continuing with uh the uneven geography

01:04:20
of sustainable transport measures

01:04:23
here you have a very simple or even a

01:04:28
map more of a scheme that shows a little

01:04:30
bit how this limitation

01:04:33
plays out in space so Oslo I don't know

01:04:37
if you've heard about that but also is

01:04:38
one of the most

01:04:39
um

01:04:40
marketized cities in terms of its

01:04:43
alleged fight against the car it's uh

01:04:45
leading some kind of a war against the

01:04:48
petrol-fueled vehicles and basically

01:04:51
there is this area in the city in which

01:04:53
um to which access is not only

01:04:55
restricted in terms of extra payment

01:04:58
right so there was actually several

01:05:01
layers of this congestion charging and

01:05:03
then the final one is this uh Ultra

01:05:06
inner city in which cars propelled by by

01:05:10
gas or fuel are not allowed is only

01:05:13
electric vehicles but then when you look

01:05:15
at the whole agglomeration of the city

01:05:16
it's quite clear that I mean this is a

01:05:19
very small area so we are actually

01:05:21
talking about quite specific zones of

01:05:24
the city which as I mentioned are

01:05:25
supposedly saved from the car and are

01:05:28
supposed to be made more pedestrian or

01:05:31
people friendly

01:05:33
same idea or same limitation can be can

01:05:38
be seen in Madrid which until recently

01:05:40
had also quite a restrictive uh

01:05:42
Mobility area this has changed with a

01:05:46
change of political majority does not

01:05:47
matter if it's this area still exists

01:05:49
although the rules have have changed to

01:05:52
some extent the idea is that Madrid

01:05:55
which was called in worldwide media as

01:05:58
an anti-car municipality a municipality

01:06:01
that takes some radical measures to to

01:06:03
limit the presence of the car in fact

01:06:06
well it does so but it does so within a

01:06:08
quite limited uh

01:06:11
designated area whereas you see that in

01:06:15
the in the general map there is a whole

01:06:17
car infrastructure around it and

01:06:19
multiple motorways both

01:06:21
around and from that Central Area so

01:06:24
there's a question with a automobility

01:06:26
is actually being

01:06:28
properly uh uh challenged or is this

01:06:32
more of an urban policy that focuses on

01:06:34
valorization of specific areas of the

01:06:37
city and here it's you don't have to be

01:06:39
a smart critical geographer to ask if

01:06:42
this is not part of some revolarization

01:06:45
strategies that try to increase rent and

01:06:48
profit to gentrify quite simply specific

01:06:52
areas of the city and the limitation of

01:06:54
car traffic being part of of that policy

01:06:57
to beautify the area to make it more

01:07:00
attractive to tourists to specific type

01:07:02
of investors

01:07:04
while limiting mobility of of this of

01:07:08
this kind

01:07:10
this we've covered and here we arrive to

01:07:13
the to the well to it to a case of of

01:07:16
such a policy limiting presence of the

01:07:18
calf the pier tonight in Brussels which

01:07:21
I'm quite sure uh all of you have uh

01:07:25
have already experienced and and see

01:07:28
so well this map you've seen quite a lot

01:07:31
before I'm sure Brussels with its um

01:07:34
Zone 30 so the the limitation of of

01:07:38
speed there and the petone marked in in

01:07:41
red uh at the moment of installation the

01:07:43
biggest pedestrian area in uh in Europe

01:07:47
I wonder whether you've got any

01:07:48
impressions of this place before I

01:07:51
um show you my take on on or share with

01:07:54
you my take on on what happened over

01:07:56
there

01:07:58
um I imagine you've been to lupiteria

01:08:00
but do you have any

01:08:02
uh any interesting thoughts about this

01:08:04
do you like this place do you think it's

01:08:06
not so great

01:08:12
um I don't know I don't I don't have a

01:08:14
very uh deep thought about it I don't

01:08:17
think but um

01:08:19
it's definitely nicer than it was uh I

01:08:22
mean like I lived in the center for like

01:08:25
five years ago or like no was it five

01:08:27
years ago like longer ago but like it

01:08:29
was really horrible like when you cycled

01:08:31
through like downtown it was really

01:08:33
awful because like the road was just

01:08:37
disgusting like you don't you didn't

01:08:40
really want to be there

01:08:42
um now I mean it's a bit

01:08:44
no I I don't have the feeling it's it's

01:08:46
very much

01:08:48
um

01:08:49
it's it's very true for what it is you

01:08:52
know like for for like

01:08:54
I don't know it doesn't really feel like

01:08:55
a downturn it feels a little bit

01:08:57
provincial

01:08:59
um but like at least it's like I'm

01:09:00
definitely happy with like that it's

01:09:03
much better than it used to be like

01:09:05
really

01:09:06
like it it's it's definitely an

01:09:08
improvement but it feels the Big City

01:09:10
Vibe a bit okay for those of you who who

01:09:14
didn't see it before it was changed into

01:09:16
a bit of scenario I pushed a slice so

01:09:18
you see in the top image uh how this

01:09:21
street could look like on a Friday

01:09:23
afternoon quite regularly so full of

01:09:26
cars for four lanes

01:09:29
um and then well the situation that's of

01:09:32
course pre-covered uh well I don't know

01:09:34
I probably right now if you took that

01:09:37
picture would be quite similar

01:09:39
um anybody else who has some some

01:09:41
impressions of how how this

01:09:43
transformation looked like

01:09:45
somebody who loves this somebody who

01:09:48
hates this

01:09:49
and for whatever reason

01:09:54
um I agree with him because it was a

01:09:57
place

01:09:58
when uh when I passed when I study in

01:10:00
Brussels where I pass with my

01:10:02
girlfriends

01:10:03
I don't want my girlfriend to let alone

01:10:06
on the other place

01:10:07
some years ago but one frustration I

01:10:12
guess from I I followed the dope process

01:10:16
and what I know was it was very

01:10:19
difficult for uh Transportation like

01:10:22
like MVB and steep

01:10:25
um public transport to pass because it's

01:10:28
the the lane was was cut

01:10:30
um yeah so

01:10:32
they wait uh wait for over two hours to

01:10:34
go to another place when set was five

01:10:37
minutes it was two hours

01:10:39
so you mean it affected other modes of

01:10:42
of of trying to not only the car but

01:10:44
also public transport yeah yeah the

01:10:48
victim was public transport and I guess

01:10:50
in in in Brussels it's very important to

01:10:53
when you have a Prestige project like

01:10:55
that you need to consider all of

01:10:58
Transport modes and not only pedestrians

01:11:01
press each project I think also is an

01:11:04
important uh

01:11:05
also like like an element to add maybe

01:11:09
is that it's terrible if you go by bike

01:11:10
it's really not made for bicycles like I

01:11:13
I tried cycling through it and I mean

01:11:15
right now it's not so busy and it's all

01:11:17
right but like on on on days when there

01:11:20
is I mean there's lots of tour tourists

01:11:22
of course lots of people use the the

01:11:24
area so then it's just really not nice

01:11:27
to cycle there yes I share these

01:11:30
Impressions I mean these are not only

01:11:31
Impressions and the fact is that and

01:11:34
this area was redeveloped but without

01:11:36
any bicycle policy in mind so there is

01:11:39
basically I'm not I'm the last person to

01:11:42
say that what was there before was great

01:11:43
but uh you can vaguely see it on the

01:11:46
right hand side of the top picture that

01:11:47
there is actually a bicycle lane not a

01:11:49
great one but there was one now it's

01:11:52
it's simply not there uh somebody's

01:11:54
writing something in the chat

01:11:56
why do they take down the larger trees

01:11:59
neutralization of bulovanos but I find

01:12:01
the Landscaping quite poor well so there

01:12:04
was a number of uh things at stake

01:12:06
um I mean let's cover that first

01:12:09
um

01:12:09
it was announced in January 2014 the

01:12:12
municipal authorities of the city of

01:12:13
Brussels so the uh Mill Brussels 1000

01:12:17
announced that they want to expand an

01:12:19
existing pedestrian zone so you already

01:12:21
had some streets especially it was

01:12:22
complex that were not open for the cars

01:12:26
and the context of that and that's quite

01:12:27
an important thing is that there was a

01:12:29
series of protests called under the

01:12:32
slogan of picnic the streets a movement

01:12:34
of uh some spontaneous Civil

01:12:36
Disobedience basically people would

01:12:38
occupy space that would normally be

01:12:40
taken by cars you see that in the the

01:12:43
picture normally a lot of cars so right

01:12:46
in front of books that will be basically

01:12:48
uh some kind of an action people would

01:12:50
just sit down and enjoy the Sun and and

01:12:53
manifest that they want uh allegedly the

01:12:56
space to be for people

01:12:58
taken away from the cars and this space

01:13:01
should be freed from the Cars to make

01:13:02
the city center for Brussels more

01:13:04
sustainable more attractive and more

01:13:06
livable

01:13:07
the project is launched in June 2015 so

01:13:09
that's when the street is closed and

01:13:11
there is an eight month test phase

01:13:13
without any infrastructural change so at

01:13:15
first to go a little bit to the question

01:13:17
of design there is no design change

01:13:19
basically industry is closed and there

01:13:21
is uh as as many people call it a sea of

01:13:24
asphalt I mean suddenly you can walk on

01:13:26
this on the street which

01:13:28
place a little bit of course on people's

01:13:30
imaginary that suddenly you realize how

01:13:32
how huge this infrastructure given to

01:13:34
the car is and and what what could

01:13:36
happen in place of this infrastructure

01:13:39
well

01:13:41
and then progressively after this

01:13:42
eight-month phase we see some kind of

01:13:44
infrastructural development so an actual

01:13:47
change of the build environment

01:13:49
the problem there is is that well there

01:13:53
was a quality of design that is being

01:13:54
put into question I'm not a designer or

01:13:57
landscaper but a lot of people have

01:13:58
criticized the way that this looks like

01:14:00
the immediate limitation is that right

01:14:02
underground we've got a canal uh towards

01:14:06
the end of division and we also have a

01:14:07
metro line of pre-metro line which runs

01:14:10
right under the the surface of the

01:14:12
street so it's not for example possible

01:14:14
apparently to put uh to put large trees

01:14:17
over there which uh already starts you

01:14:19
know making an impact in terms of how

01:14:21
the space is uh space is done

01:14:25
um well there were very high aspirations

01:14:28
when when plutonium was was uh was

01:14:31
announced it was not only supposed to be

01:14:32
a classical project or According to some

01:14:34
scholars in Brussels or even politicians

01:14:37
it was not a transport project or a

01:14:39
Mobility project it was an urban project

01:14:41
an urban renewal project which by

01:14:43
closing this uh Paris like Boulevard

01:14:46
because actually it is in its uh in its

01:14:51
architecture very much an inspiration of

01:14:53
Parisian boulevards the closing of it to

01:14:56
motorized traffic was supposedly a step

01:14:58
towards getting the city center or the

01:15:01
city as such out of decline to put um as

01:15:05
the mayor of Marissa meal of the of that

01:15:08
particular municipality said that

01:15:10
Brussels the Belgian and European

01:15:12
Capital would finally enjoy a truly

01:15:14
Dynamic pedestrian attractive and

01:15:16
friendly inner city like many other

01:15:18
International Metropolis

01:15:21
which is located in the northern part of

01:15:24
of the pitonier and that's the famous uh

01:15:27
square of famous I'm not sure but the

01:15:29
characteristic one with the Coca-Cola uh

01:15:31
signed that uh lights up it was compared

01:15:35
to Times Square so the idea was to make

01:15:38
this project

01:15:39
um allow Brussels to become an

01:15:41
international City to to create this

01:15:44
Prestige project as it was I think very

01:15:46
rightly said uh that would put brussels

01:15:48
on the international map it was not just

01:15:49
a question of you know getting rid of

01:15:52
some some correlated nuisances

01:15:55
and of course the amount of the plant

01:15:57
was announced there were a number of

01:15:58
critics so there were shopkeepers that

01:16:00
were upset claiming that they would lose

01:16:02
customers because people could not drive

01:16:04
into the shop residents a number of

01:16:06
Citizen organizations what were they the

01:16:09
the issues that they would mention I

01:16:11
mean the the the problems that they

01:16:13
would that they would note about the

01:16:14
project well they very much relate to

01:16:16
this uneven geography that I that I was

01:16:18
talking about so if you look at the the

01:16:20
the map of the of the pizza in red you

01:16:23
see these

01:16:24
um this at that time Europe's largest

01:16:27
pedestrian Zone I think now it's been

01:16:28
surpassed by Ghent and and other cities

01:16:32
um Brussels is certainly not the only

01:16:34
city in Europe or in the world that

01:16:35
engages in in these policies it is of

01:16:39
course the main Central axis is cut but

01:16:42
you see that you can actually drive

01:16:44
around the the city uh the city center

01:16:47
so you've got this area which is

01:16:50
pedestrian friendly if we can put it

01:16:52
this way where cars

01:16:54
um Mobility is extremely limited

01:16:57
um but in fact you can quite easily

01:16:58
drive into the Pentagon as we call it

01:17:00
and drive around on top of that what's

01:17:02
also very clear is that

01:17:05
um a particularity of Brussels which is

01:17:06
a very high presence of underground or

01:17:09
multi-story parking lots is largely

01:17:11
unquestioned so actually

01:17:14
this this day today there is about 19

01:17:18
000 parking spots within the Pentagon

01:17:19
within the stroke City Center of

01:17:22
Brussels the original plan of

01:17:24
pedestrianizing Boulevard

01:17:27
included the creation of additional 1

01:17:30
600 parking spots so the idea would be

01:17:33
that of course we give this space to The

01:17:36
Pedestrian and we we allow the space to

01:17:39
be to be somehow reclaimed from the car

01:17:42
but in fact the cost of this or the

01:17:43
price of this I don't know how to call

01:17:45
it is that we actually adds to the car

01:17:47
infrastructure so we definitely do not

01:17:49
want to make this less accessible as it

01:17:52
was called by by The Cars

01:17:55
and then as one of you mentioned there

01:17:57
was an immediate conflict with uh with

01:17:59
the public transport operator the most

01:18:01
important one in Brussels Steven who

01:18:03
basically saw uh day lines pushed out of

01:18:07
the zone so suddenly the buses that

01:18:08
would cross that area have to be

01:18:11
um have to have the have to have these

01:18:13
stops relocated which means that the

01:18:15
accessibility for people who rely on

01:18:16
public transport is

01:18:18
uh is somewhat reduced

01:18:22
right and then well that's some years

01:18:26
later I think that picture is from 2018

01:18:28
as far as I remember checking on Google

01:18:31
well there was a kind of a pushback

01:18:33
right so the cars that were at first

01:18:35
definitely not allowed on the pitonier

01:18:36
now in some circumstances in some

01:18:39
situations can actually enter so you can

01:18:41
actually see and it's taken directly

01:18:43
from Google I didn't have to go to the

01:18:45
pizza near and wait for a truck to enter

01:18:48
you actually see uh of course the

01:18:50
delivery vehicles but also public

01:18:52
transport you see over there in the back

01:18:54
of the of the picture I see there's a

01:18:56
bus making a turn and entering a petunia

01:18:58
and whenever I'm there with friends who

01:19:00
are not from Brussels I mean they are

01:19:02
they are really surprised to be on The

01:19:04
Pedestrian area with public transport

01:19:06
buses and trucks and taxi drivers and

01:19:08
other vehicles who in exceptional

01:19:10
circumstances actually can enter which

01:19:13
questions a little bit this I mean is

01:19:15
this a pedestrian area or is this a

01:19:17
pedestrian area but without uh really

01:19:20
getting rid of all the cars just some

01:19:22
cars

01:19:24
um the question of yeah

01:19:27
um making this a Prestige project and

01:19:29
putting Brussels on the map I mean there

01:19:32
is an argument there to be made and uh

01:19:34
and some local critical geographers have

01:19:36
made it myself included that this in

01:19:39
fact indeed is not a transport project

01:19:40
in the mobility project it's clearly a

01:19:42
project of rivalry valorizing this

01:19:45
particular part of the city it's quite

01:19:47
clear that as you go down southwards

01:19:52
towards the South Station

01:19:56
those of you who have uh who have been

01:19:58
there I'm sure I'm sure noticed it those

01:20:00
of you who haven't that's where we would

01:20:02
go on the Excursion that I hope we will

01:20:05
do in Spring you see that this is one of

01:20:08
the poorest neighborhoods in Brussels

01:20:09
one with very high youth unemployment

01:20:12
especially where there is a very

01:20:14
um

01:20:15
precarious tightly knit but very

01:20:18
vulnerable local economy and any kind of

01:20:21
change in in built environment puts this

01:20:24
economy on the on the huge pressure

01:20:26
especially when the narrative around

01:20:29
clearly uh includes this idea of

01:20:32
bringing big Brands tourism uh to The

01:20:36
Pedestrian area making this place of

01:20:38
festivities of consumption of continuous

01:20:41
Festival

01:20:43
um

01:20:44
so for example the alderman for comments

01:20:47
of the city of Brussels famously said

01:20:49
that the objective here is not to change

01:20:51
Mobility the objective is to recreate a

01:20:54
commercial Promenade new brands which

01:20:56
are not yet present in Brussels are

01:20:58
coming there is a real craze and you can

01:21:00
feel it

01:21:01
for the current Brussels 1000 mayor not

01:21:06
the one that had stepped down because of

01:21:08
some corruption Scandal

01:21:10
um the aim of the project is to keep or

01:21:13
bring the middle class to Brussels to

01:21:15
increase its tax base so suddenly the

01:21:18
idea is not just to or not at all to

01:21:20
actually get rid of the cars or or allow

01:21:23
pedestrians to enjoy the some kind of

01:21:25
newly created area it's a very Urban

01:21:27
project in a very kind of Twisted way so

01:21:30
the idea really is to create a new space

01:21:32
a new neighborhood perhaps of

01:21:34
consumption of leisure of 24 7 shopping

01:21:39
which also of course uses or engages

01:21:44
with the narrative for sustainability

01:21:46
and livability and is somewhat related

01:21:48
to mobility and transport but to a

01:21:50
limited extent

01:21:59
you see that there is almost only white

01:22:02
people there like so the the people that

01:22:05
you talked about that you see on the

01:22:06
lower slide

01:22:08
um like like the owners of the PC market

01:22:11
on the owners of like 0.50 like

01:22:13
basically all all people with the color

01:22:16
they they don't they don't feature in

01:22:18
the marketing of the of the city about

01:22:20
the project it's a very good point of

01:22:22
course that's a that's a very common

01:22:24
issue with these visualizations and

01:22:26
imagining of uh future everyone's Super

01:22:29
Why

01:22:30
um but like there's there I saw that

01:22:31
there's one black man on the right

01:22:33
but there's also no

01:22:35
um yeah I know people with disabilities

01:22:37
very few old people yeah so yes I mean

01:22:42
it's a it's not a very diverse image

01:22:45
it's a good point and also in no way

01:22:47
does it correspond to the actual reality

01:22:49
of of that neighborhood and the kind of

01:22:51
services absolutely no I mean yeah

01:22:55
um Well we I'm really need to speed it

01:22:58
up so um so we cover some important uh

01:23:01
stuff okay until we finish no no but

01:23:03
thank you it's a good comment there is

01:23:05
of course all issues related to

01:23:06
participation and and no actual change

01:23:10
of power in in the patronier but I think

01:23:12
the petone is a very good example of of

01:23:14
how these sustainable ideas can be

01:23:17
applied without changing at all

01:23:19
questions of who actually decides and

01:23:20
for whom uh transport policies are being

01:23:23
made

01:23:24
so very often a sustainable discourse

01:23:27
focuses when it imagines participation

01:23:30
of users of the of the beneficence of

01:23:33
the of the projects uh it basically

01:23:35
imagines that the the main idea is there

01:23:38
to build consensus to inform people of

01:23:40
the decisions that are rational that are

01:23:42
are good practices best practices in

01:23:45
terms of achieving sustainable Mobility

01:23:46
protecting the environment and whatnot

01:23:49
so as a Flemish actually scholar has

01:23:52
once wrote in in 2000 about the problems

01:23:55
of sustainable transport policies that's

01:23:57
the last bullet point these policies

01:24:00
include a harmonious and conflict

01:24:01
developing vocabulary that ignores and

01:24:04
silences the deeply contested ways

01:24:06
through which the transport system is

01:24:07
continuously shaped and transformed and

01:24:09
which inevitably results in a variety of

01:24:11
winning and losing interest groups

01:24:15
that's I think the case in many other

01:24:17
sustainable transport projects this idea

01:24:19
of winners and loses is swept under the

01:24:22
carpet so in in theory everybody

01:24:24
everybody gains but those who are

01:24:26
clearly upset are not heard are not

01:24:28
really listened to and often are mocked

01:24:30
so again we go back to this moral

01:24:33
geography of bad behavior and good

01:24:34
behavior of City shopkeepers who don't

01:24:37
understand that this is a project that

01:24:38
they will benefit from but car drivers

01:24:41
they want to access the City versus good

01:24:43
consuming middle class pedestrians or or

01:24:46
cyclists not so more not so much in the

01:24:48
case of application but scientists are

01:24:50
also part of the part of the vision

01:24:53
um

01:24:54
and in all this to make this point quite

01:24:57
short there is much more impact no not

01:25:01
impact much more Focus much more

01:25:03
emphasis on

01:25:05
um the success of these practices rather

01:25:08
than on the interaction with complex

01:25:11
social spatial phenomena that are there

01:25:14
in the city so there is much more focus

01:25:16
on on the transport part of Transport

01:25:18
project rather than or the urban part of

01:25:20
the purchase well we don't have a lot of

01:25:22
time to deal with okay what could be

01:25:24
done with with this hegemony of

01:25:27
neoclassical on the one hand that's last

01:25:29
week and sustainable on the other

01:25:32
um that's today perspectives on

01:25:33
transport but let's try

01:25:36
um so what would diverse critical

01:25:38
approaches to to transport and Mobility

01:25:41
be on the one hand

01:25:43
the new mobilities paradigm so that's

01:25:45
another reading for today if you manage

01:25:47
to read it uh that's great if not I

01:25:50
encourage you to to have a look because

01:25:52
that's an absolutely fundamental reading

01:25:55
for Mobility Scholars these days I mean

01:25:57
maybe sheller and John Aria are two very

01:25:59
important figures in in in this field of

01:26:02
geography or or any kind of discipline

01:26:05
that deals with mobility and transport

01:26:06
so here

01:26:08
we've got a bit of a shift of attention

01:26:10
shift of focus and

01:26:12
it's really putting um it's shifting

01:26:15
away from transport as a as an

01:26:17
infrastructural phenomenon for example

01:26:18
to a Mobility as a social and political

01:26:21
phenomenon that's expected Builds on on

01:26:24
diverse disciplines from sociology and

01:26:26
political studies to ethnography and

01:26:28
anthropology

01:26:29
and it really explores a lot of issues

01:26:31
that cultural studies Scholars for

01:26:33
example would deal with looking at in a

01:26:35
number of phenomena happening in cities

01:26:36
so different representations and

01:26:38
meanings of Mobility Sensations

01:26:40
experiencing experiences of Mobility so

01:26:43
everything that happens on this micro

01:26:44
level of what people what kind of

01:26:46
practices and Norms are being being

01:26:49
observable or being practiced in

01:26:51
Mobility related spaces in public

01:26:53
transport for example in these

01:26:55
pedestrian areas and what cultural codes

01:26:57
and Norms are related to automobility

01:27:01
uh the problem with this particular

01:27:03
approach is that well it looks very much

01:27:07
at the micro level and whenever it

01:27:09
engages with structural issues around

01:27:10
Mobility it runs the risk of being quite

01:27:13
descriptive so it mentions a number of

01:27:15
issues race class inequality but there

01:27:18
is not so much of a methodological depth

01:27:19
in terms of exploring these issues and

01:27:22
also it's a concept that is quite

01:27:23
Western in a sense that it developed in

01:27:25
the global North and then rather

01:27:27
specific areas of it and it only now

01:27:30
starts engaging with with situations

01:27:33
with empirical context in the global

01:27:35
stuff

01:27:38
another approach another Avenue for for

01:27:42
for doing critical research about

01:27:44
transformability is building on the

01:27:47
traditions of urban political economy of

01:27:49
Transport right so looking at the city

01:27:51
as a social and political construct

01:27:53
which by no means by in no way

01:27:57
is governed by some rational laws of

01:28:00
supply and demand like in the

01:28:01
neoclassical Paradigm or which does not

01:28:04
really look at people as consumers that

01:28:07
have to be convinced to to drop or to

01:28:10
disengage from

01:28:12
um unwelcome or bad type of behavior and

01:28:15
start engaging in good type of behavior

01:28:17
and but rather looking at people at as

01:28:20
at Urban inhabitants as political agents

01:28:22
who do not make just rational decisions

01:28:24
in terms of how they move but have

01:28:26
political potential to to shape the the

01:28:29
urban reality to change how transport

01:28:32
and Mobility is organized in the in the

01:28:33
locality in this city and when you look

01:28:36
at critical urban geography and a lot of

01:28:38
names that I'm sure you've already heard

01:28:40
or maybe even read

01:28:42
um from before

01:28:44
David Harvey Neil Smith Edward Soldier

01:28:46
they've all contributed to to

01:28:50
conceptualizing to exploring this Lane

01:28:52
between infrastructural development and

01:28:55
social spatial distribution of public

01:28:56
services so transport has has been there

01:29:00
to to um

01:29:02
to analyze the critical development of

01:29:04
the city but

01:29:06
absolutely foundational uh readings

01:29:09
there or the first steps towards

01:29:11
critically exploring the relationship

01:29:13
between the transport and the City come

01:29:15
from feminist geographers who would

01:29:17
arrive and that's the reading that you

01:29:19
also

01:29:20
um I think was a sign for today uh Susan

01:29:23
Hansen's work on the deconstructing this

01:29:27
apparent divide between the home and

01:29:28
work and

01:29:30
attaching and women with domestic uh

01:29:35
situations and apparently

01:29:38
imagining them as less mobile Less

01:29:41
Mobile beings while uh attaching this

01:29:44
this Mobility potential to to

01:29:46
predominantly male male subjects and

01:29:50
male situations

01:29:52
foreign

01:29:54
part of that is to understand

01:29:57
the homework relationship and homework

01:30:01
commute which I mentioned last week is

01:30:03
is absolutely the most uh well let's see

01:30:06
the foundational focus of Transport

01:30:07
geographers analyzing

01:30:10
um these Mobility patterns related to

01:30:11
the to the move from work to home and

01:30:14
the feminist geographers already in

01:30:16
1980s demonstrated that this uh this way

01:30:20
of looking at transport and also this

01:30:21
way of engaging Mobility is fundamental

01:30:24
for maintaining uh for maintaining

01:30:27
capitalism this is something that is the

01:30:28
Cornerstone of the of the capitalist

01:30:30
system in cities or outside of them

01:30:34
what emerges from this is understanding

01:30:37
transport and Mobility is not just uh an

01:30:39
infrastructural phenomenon or something

01:30:41
that has some environmental

01:30:43
repercussions and some social ones and

01:30:45
here I'm thinking about sustainable

01:30:46
approaches to Mobility but as

01:30:48
essentially a form of capital Mobility

01:30:51
is a as a potential that is unevenly

01:30:56
distributed as any form of capital

01:30:58
around or across Society across its

01:31:01
different spaces and across its its

01:31:03
classes which leads to understanding and

01:31:06
challenging different structures social

01:31:08
political economic that stand behind

01:31:12
what makes transport unsustainable in

01:31:14
the first place so it's really asking a

01:31:16
question why are people moving in

01:31:18
particular ways not because they are

01:31:20
used to a particular lifestyle because

01:31:22
they have some cultural norms but

01:31:24
understanding a political and economic

01:31:25
system that enables for instance the

01:31:28
domination of the car and trying to

01:31:30
address the system as a result rather

01:31:32
than looking at how people can become

01:31:34
convinced and or how situation in terms

01:31:37
of Mobility can be changed in specific

01:31:38
areas of the city it's looking at things

01:31:41
Much More Much More broadly in much more

01:31:42
structural ways

01:31:45
right so

01:31:47
and here I attached bibliography to the

01:31:50
end of this to this slide so you can

01:31:52
look at these different studies if you

01:31:54
if you're interested in transported

01:31:55
Mobility there is a line of of research

01:31:59
that is looked at the transported

01:32:00
Mobility as a way of reproducing

01:32:04
existing social political economic

01:32:07
interests regulatory Frameworks power

01:32:09
relations regulated by the market on the

01:32:12
one hand and by the state and very often

01:32:13
contested by from the bottom up

01:32:17
there is

01:32:18
a lot of research for some reason the

01:32:21
reason the references are not showing up

01:32:22
but if you're interested I'm more than

01:32:24
happy to send you those that something

01:32:26
strange with my slide here but there is

01:32:28
an ongoing work uh already going back to

01:32:30
the 1990s that shows how neoliberal

01:32:33
policies that affect Urban culture

01:32:36
provision of housing Urban environment

01:32:39
are also extremely present in provision

01:32:41
of transport and Mobility how in in a

01:32:44
natural transport is increasingly

01:32:46
commodified and for example congestion

01:32:48
charging that I mentioned today is part

01:32:50
of that it's turning and we could think

01:32:53
public space that's an urban Motorway or

01:32:55
an urban street is into a commodity that

01:32:58
has an additional price tag attached to

01:33:00
it which as we consume we have to

01:33:03
additionally pay for depending as I

01:33:05
mentioned not on our means but basically

01:33:08
on our on our demand

01:33:12
there is also a fundamental issue that

01:33:14
many geographers have dealt with that is

01:33:17
of Transport related inequality and

01:33:19
exclusion so basically trying to

01:33:21
understand to what extent transport

01:33:24
um enables movement of of some people

01:33:27
while restricting that of that of others

01:33:30
this we will Skip and of course uh well

01:33:34
it might seem very obvious today but if

01:33:37
you look at what was being done in in

01:33:39
geography in urban geography or

01:33:41
transport geography in the 80s and the

01:33:42
90s that was definitely not the case

01:33:44
there is now a rise of research which

01:33:47
looks at the questions of class and the

01:33:49
questions of race and the question of

01:33:51
gender is absolutely fundamental for

01:33:53
understanding uh Transport Systems in

01:33:56
cities and and Beyond them and one of

01:33:58
them is this

01:34:00
um well maybe not such a foundational

01:34:03
reading but still something that is is

01:34:05
very important and and and really

01:34:07
defined the agenda of of research into

01:34:09
transport for at least this decade uh of

01:34:13
course there's there's more recent stuff

01:34:15
that also has been written but I think

01:34:16
this is quite a nice uh introduction to

01:34:19
the question of gender and Mobility

01:34:21
um

01:34:22
and here we see that as with the

01:34:26
questions of race and the question with

01:34:28
class but this is something that uh was

01:34:30
already quite established in the field

01:34:31
already uh there is an Inseparable

01:34:34
relationship between gender and and

01:34:36
Mobility that on the one hand translated

01:34:39
mobility mean development or some kind

01:34:42
of opening of accessibility to different

01:34:44
opportunities breaking this supposed

01:34:46
Paradigm of uh the domestic female and

01:34:50
the work-related male but actually

01:34:52
Mobility is something that opens uh

01:34:55
opens this time and that gender on the

01:34:57
other hand affects travel reasons and

01:34:59
patents in terms of the complexity in

01:35:01
terms of the frequency and regularity

01:35:04
and in terms of why actually people

01:35:06
engage in in movement why do they

01:35:08
actually move around the city

01:35:11
and perhaps one critique that could be

01:35:13
made about the paper that I ask you to

01:35:15
to read for today is that well it

01:35:17
approaches women as a rather unified

01:35:19
category that can be uh uh maybe not

01:35:22
reduced but summarized into in in terms

01:35:26
of particular Mobility patterns that uh

01:35:29
half of humanity engages I think that's

01:35:31
a little bit uh risky always but what

01:35:33
clearly

01:35:35
um I think is interesting in this kind

01:35:37
of line of work as I said uh there is

01:35:39
there is a definite follow-up and and

01:35:41
work that explore these questions in

01:35:43
much more detail and and it's much more

01:35:45
fine tune to a sophisticated but we see

01:35:47
that

01:35:49
um without considering the agenda

01:35:50
component we we basically miss the fact

01:35:52
that uh in many urban contexts women

01:35:56
engage in a completely different way

01:35:57
with Mobility they conduct trips which

01:36:00
are much more complex regular because

01:36:03
they quite simply are related to uh

01:36:05
diverse care related activities they

01:36:08
would be much more inclined or perhaps

01:36:10
forced to

01:36:12
um to bring other people along to uh to

01:36:16
act as drivers for other passengers and

01:36:19
because they engage in quite simply more

01:36:21
activity these than than male

01:36:24
subjects in this way I'm simplifying

01:36:27
here of course a whole lot but this way

01:36:30
of approaching transport and Mobility

01:36:31
uncovers and not only differences in

01:36:34
terms of how people move but differences

01:36:36
in terms of power relations that are

01:36:38
there behind movement and transport

01:36:40
which in my humble opinion is maybe a

01:36:44
little bit there in sustainable

01:36:45
approaches to Mobility but it's quite

01:36:47
simply not pronounced enough or does not

01:36:49
really show us

01:36:51
um in full depth the the multi-level

01:36:55
structure of power relations that are

01:36:57
there behind behind transported and

01:36:59
Mobility

01:37:02
um now what's left I'm we are we are

01:37:06
running out of time so so I I don't

01:37:08
definitely don't want to talk about

01:37:09
everything but

01:37:10
what's also important to remember is

01:37:12
that well besides questions of Transport

01:37:15
workers because so far we've we've

01:37:17
basically talked mostly if not only

01:37:20
about passengers transport users people

01:37:22
who use transport

01:37:24
um there's a question of Transport labor

01:37:26
but also very importantly a lot of

01:37:29
research done on on transport and

01:37:31
Mobility as a vehicle for for some

01:37:33
contestation discontent and struggle and

01:37:36
I started these two sessions with uh

01:37:39
with Greta tunberg with protists in

01:37:40
Chile and other places and

01:37:44
year in year out sometimes sometimes

01:37:46
month and month out you see that

01:37:48
transport is used as a very important uh

01:37:51
subject for a lot of for very diverse

01:37:53
movements and social groups to expressly

01:37:56
discontent with whatever it is and

01:37:59
sometimes quite directly in capitalist

01:38:02
system and that's the case with G Le

01:38:04
Jean and who quite symbolically would

01:38:07
occupy roundabouts across rural or

01:38:10
Suburban France and sometimes

01:38:14
symbolically and that's in East

01:38:16
Jerusalem a Palestinian activists

01:38:18
attacking

01:38:20
light rails and kind of Tramway stations

01:38:22
as a symbol of Israeli colonization in

01:38:25
East Jerusalem

01:38:27
um sometimes these will be protest

01:38:28
against uh some kind of a surface level

01:38:31
policy like the increase of public

01:38:33
transport fares or policing and that's

01:38:35
the case in New York City or the

01:38:37
construction of of one of these

01:38:39
underground parkings related to Le

01:38:41
pitonier that would add to the number of

01:38:43
parking spots in the city while

01:38:46
supposedly actually opening the city for

01:38:48
the for the people

01:38:51
this we will have to skip

01:38:54
um the very last point that I want to

01:38:56
make today I mean I I still would like

01:38:58
to give us maybe 10 minutes for your

01:39:00
questions and maybe some comments uh if

01:39:03
you still have energy to to do that is

01:39:06
that and that's perhaps related a little

01:39:08
bit to this question of new

01:39:09
liberalization of transforms and

01:39:11
Mobility is that what we see uh is that

01:39:14
despite these different

01:39:16
um theoretical approaches and critical

01:39:18
questions that people critical

01:39:21
geographers are asking we see

01:39:25
um a process of standardization of

01:39:27
Transport policies so if you are a

01:39:29
transport engineer and transport

01:39:31
Economist today there is really this

01:39:33
tendency towards

01:39:35
unifying experiences of different cities

01:39:37
into a portfolio of best practices which

01:39:40
are then transferable from from one

01:39:43
locality to another there's a huge

01:39:44
business behind it and not only in terms

01:39:47
of think tanks uh and big consultancy

01:39:50
firms but a whole flurry of events which

01:39:52
you can learn from

01:39:54
experiences of others which you can

01:39:56
learn about what your city should be

01:39:58
doing

01:39:59
and

01:40:00
some Scholars have engaged with that

01:40:02
studying specifically the policy

01:40:05
mobility of of these best practices and

01:40:07
recipes in the field of urban transport

01:40:10
but what's perhaps quite important to be

01:40:13
to be added to this is that well

01:40:15
the story of of policy transfer is is

01:40:18
quite long I mean the the tradition of

01:40:20
deploying Western World Views

01:40:22
eurocentric Concepts and theories and

01:40:24
methods in a more or less unchanged way

01:40:27
in in some other geographical contexts

01:40:30
in Africa Asia Latin America

01:40:33
it's a very long story and the story is

01:40:35
has a name in its colonization or

01:40:37
coloniality

01:40:39
and this is something that really is

01:40:42
there to be done by by the future

01:40:43
generation of of

01:40:46
critical geographers or the transport

01:40:48
geographers or Urban geographers is that

01:40:49
of decolonizing this body of knowledge

01:40:52
which

01:40:53
um pretty much everything that I have

01:40:55
referred to uh in in these two sessions

01:40:58
comes very much

01:41:00
um from the global North that reflects

01:41:01
my own education that's something that I

01:41:04
think I still have to do myself is to

01:41:07
really start looking at the transport

01:41:10
reality and start defining

01:41:12
um formulating questions about this

01:41:14
reality in terms of Transit Mobility not

01:41:17
from our Global Northern perspective but

01:41:19
also that of the South and just

01:41:21
uh again it's a it's a just a simple

01:41:24
example of what this could mean in

01:41:26
practice

01:41:28
is looking at the question of

01:41:30
informality in transport which

01:41:32
traditionally uh that's a slide from one

01:41:34
of these classic reports uh Commissioned

01:41:38
I think either by un or the World Bank

01:41:40
on informal transport looks at

01:41:43
informality in transport as something

01:41:45
that means bad quality in terms of

01:41:47
safety of passengers speeding

01:41:49
environmental impact basically some old

01:41:52
rickety Vehicles which uh await to be

01:41:57
transformed into modern Western formal

01:42:00
public transport system the the kind of

01:42:03
we know from northern cities like

01:42:05
Brussels or or many others in Belgium

01:42:07
France or Germany or whatnot

01:42:11
um but and that's something that has

01:42:13
been done quite recently or is in

01:42:15
process

01:42:17
um is actually understanding our

01:42:19
experience of transport and mobility in

01:42:21
our formal environment is very much

01:42:23
something that can be informed by these

01:42:26
informal experiences of the Google South

01:42:28
an example well if you ever are at wbd

01:42:32
these days unfortunately this practice

01:42:34
is on hold because of you know what

01:42:36
there is a flowery maybe not but at

01:42:40
least a few informal transport practices

01:42:42
that you can find in the gardeni area

01:42:45
these informal taxis vans that bring

01:42:48
passengers informally somewhat illegally

01:42:50
from the South Station to um

01:42:54
Charlevoix airport so the Brussels South

01:42:56
Charlevoix airport and to Paris which ex

01:42:58
well exhibit a very strong similarity

01:43:02
with

01:43:03
many other informal practices that you

01:43:04
can find in cities across South Asia

01:43:07
Africa and Latin America

01:43:09
and then finally while these practices

01:43:11
of course attract whenever they do they

01:43:13
attract very negative attention of the

01:43:15
media of the police they are treated as

01:43:17
something that is a illegal and be

01:43:19
unfair to formal Regulators that pay

01:43:22
taxes and have to operate within the

01:43:25
legal framework of in this case the

01:43:28
Brussels capital region

01:43:29
there is and here we go back to the

01:43:32
beginning of the of the of the first

01:43:34
session a number of practices which are

01:43:37
proposed by the transport industry

01:43:38
transport of Mobility industry like Uber

01:43:40
or many other app-based practices which

01:43:43
are essentially informal practices which

01:43:45
try to operate in the in statuses of the

01:43:48
system and somewhat legal but also not

01:43:52
not to the full extent if you think for

01:43:54
example about what Uber does to its

01:43:56
workers or what is the spatial impact if

01:44:00
we can put the sway of these e-scooters

01:44:02
which uh operate in public space but

01:44:05
very often literally occupy the space

01:44:07
the paving and and whatnot without

01:44:10
necessarily making the system officially

01:44:13
legal or recognized

01:44:17
well here we pause our little right of

01:44:21
two sessions uh I apologize for this bit

01:44:23
of a fast-paced ending to the second

01:44:25
session but we just uh I realized that

01:44:27
we we ran out of time to discuss things

01:44:29
a little bit more detailed way but we

01:44:33
still have eight minutes for some

01:44:34
questions if you have them uh maybe some

01:44:37
points that you you have in your in your

01:44:39
in your head right now something that

01:44:40
you want to share this is the moment

01:44:44
and maybe I'll stop sharing my slides

01:44:56
do you have some questions some comments

01:45:12
well

01:45:15
it's perfectly fine if you don't of

01:45:17
course I mean it's quite late in the day

01:45:19
I understand it

01:45:21
and it's it's definitely a sub-optimal

01:45:24
experience to do that through through

01:45:26
Zoom world

01:45:27
any of these platforms

01:45:34
all right Vitali is

01:45:37
asking about transport labor and there's

01:45:40
also one more technical question

01:45:41
well quite simply the concept of

01:45:44
Transport labor looks at Labor Relations

01:45:46
and conditions in transport so it's

01:45:50
trying to

01:45:52
um

01:45:53
change the emphasis a little bit I mean

01:45:55
if you look at the literature on the

01:45:56
neoclassical or sustainable side

01:45:59
and the predominant focus of

01:46:03
I would really say 99 of the studies is

01:46:06
on the passenger on the on the driver or

01:46:09
the or the consumer and the question of

01:46:13
what working conditions shift to

01:46:16
sustainable transport involves for

01:46:17
example it's very rarely asked

01:46:20
and that I think can lead us into some

01:46:23
dead end

01:46:25
situations in which for example we we

01:46:28
really gave a lot of Hope and we built a

01:46:31
lot of expectations towards some

01:46:32
Mobility practices like uber like the

01:46:34
electric scooters or whatnot without

01:46:37
really understanding that um and that

01:46:40
comes from transport labor literature

01:46:42
that the main Innovation that Ubi brings

01:46:44
to the table perhaps is not uh

01:46:46
connecting drivers and users because

01:46:49
that existed before and I mean informal

01:46:51
transport without the app of course but

01:46:54
it exists in most uh cities in the world

01:46:58
in a global some Global Northern cities

01:47:00
being an exception rather than the rule

01:47:02
but the actual Innovation is degrading

01:47:06
transport degrading working relations to

01:47:09
uh end of the 19th century basically a

01:47:12
worker has very few rights so it does

01:47:14
not have the right to unionize to

01:47:15
collectively bargain and it's not even

01:47:17
recognized as a worker it's basically

01:47:19
some kind of free atom contractor

01:47:23
who

01:47:25
in spare Leisure Time engages in driving

01:47:28
people around the city which we all know

01:47:31
from now a whole body of work on Uber is

01:47:34
definitely not the case I mean these

01:47:36
people are full-time workers not just

01:47:38
hobbyists who try to make some spare

01:47:41
money on the on the side

01:47:43
um so yes

01:47:46
that's what transport labor is about

01:47:49
some technical questions let's address

01:47:50
those for the next discussion seminar is

01:47:52
it the same way of working with

01:47:54
PowerPoint and voice over

01:47:58
um well the way I understand you did it

01:48:00
in other discussion seminars is that you

01:48:02
basically recorded your presentation

01:48:04
which then either you sent to me I think

01:48:07
that's probably a better

01:48:09
solution and we basically listen to and

01:48:12
then we have a discussion which you

01:48:14
facilitate right as those who discuss

01:48:16
the paper

01:48:17
uh so it's not exactly voice over I mean

01:48:20
so you don't present the PowerPoint live

01:48:22
the idea is that you pre-recorded the

01:48:25
presentation with your fellow uh

01:48:27
students

01:48:29
and will the exam be online as well yes

01:48:32
the exam will be online and we are

01:48:34
meeting with basnick and David to

01:48:36
discuss exactly how this will be done

01:48:38
most likely we'll be in well obviously

01:48:40
since we will not be in your rooms it

01:48:44
will be an open book exam

01:48:46
so you will have access to the slides

01:48:47
and all that so but since we haven't

01:48:50
done that before it would be a classic

01:48:52
exam we are we are discussing how to do

01:48:54
this so that it's challenging enough for

01:48:56
you and also not too difficult

01:49:01
um

01:49:01
right so with the voice voice over

01:49:04
indeed

01:49:05
the Belgian Brussels government ever

01:49:06
taken any action to prevent informal

01:49:08
Transportation do you know how relaxed

01:49:10
they are towards this well actually I

01:49:11
researched these navit as they called

01:49:15
they'll go from midi to the Charlevoix

01:49:17
airport and

01:49:18
no the Russell's government is

01:49:21
definitely not happy about these these

01:49:23
uh informal taxis the situation there is

01:49:26
that these men and all of them are a

01:49:30
male

01:49:31
um uh official taxi drivers so they have

01:49:34
a taxi license but what they basically

01:49:36
do is that to make more money they offer

01:49:39
individual seats in in the events and

01:49:42
the taxis and that's precisely what's

01:49:44
illegal so you cannot as a taxi driver

01:49:46
in Brussels you cannot uh

01:49:49
basically stand there on the street and

01:49:51
try to approach potential passengers

01:49:54
offering them individual places in the

01:49:56
car it has to be the whole car that is

01:49:58
rented

01:49:59
well it's a bit ironic but uh what

01:50:03
happened a few years after this practice

01:50:05
uh got into the focus of I don't want to

01:50:08
say public debate but basically these

01:50:10
drivers started being harassed by police

01:50:11
and there was a legal procedure against

01:50:13
them uh flipko I don't know if that name

01:50:16
rings a bell it's a company that runs

01:50:18
the official pass from midi to Charlotte

01:50:21
Airport started exactly exactly that so

01:50:25
they basically now offer well now it's

01:50:27
suspended but they started offering a

01:50:29
van service which goes door to gate as

01:50:31
it's called and it picks individual

01:50:33
passengers and individual seats are

01:50:35
offered and for some reason this is

01:50:37
perfectly legal whereas the taxi drivers

01:50:40
are apparently yeah engaging in an

01:50:44
illegal activity

01:50:45
no uh just uh just as a rebound do you

01:50:49
know why flipko

01:50:52
um like implemented this but in a

01:50:54
non-competitive way what I mean is that

01:50:56
they're actually more expensive than the

01:50:59
not that they're like informal of it

01:51:01
because I think they they have a very

01:51:04
different customer Target so people who

01:51:07
would take an event that's also from my

01:51:09
own work they would be very often of

01:51:12
immigrant backgrounds so there's a lot

01:51:13
of people from Eastern Europe from

01:51:15
maghreb who are quite simply used to do

01:51:18
this mode of Transport for them this is

01:51:19
a very common thing to see

01:51:22
and use in the country of origin

01:51:26
and also they the drivers of the navette

01:51:29
would basically find the customers on

01:51:31
the spot itself so you walk towards the

01:51:33
bus I don't know if you've ever had that

01:51:34
experience but uh whenever I had to walk

01:51:37
to the bus

01:51:39
or flipko and they would try to approach

01:51:42
you and convince you to ride with them

01:51:45
whereas I think uh people who use the

01:51:48
internet who have access to a website

01:51:49
who can who know how to book a ride who

01:51:52
have a credit card to book a ride

01:51:54
that's uh yeah that's a different Target

01:51:57
group

01:51:59
um so maybe that's why flipko can offer

01:52:02
prices which are not exactly competitive

01:52:04
on the economic front

01:52:07
um

01:52:09
well but what it means that's the last

01:52:10
sentence about the navette is that uh

01:52:13
informality in this case it's some kind

01:52:15
of a front for in this case State

01:52:17
institutions to Define what's legal or

01:52:19
not I mean for them to decide that the

01:52:22
navage the informal drivers are informal

01:52:25
and therefore legal and I mean it's an

01:52:28
arbitrary decision to decide that this

01:52:30
is informal whereas Uber is formal

01:52:33
um or actually in the case of uber and

01:52:35
Brussels authorities the regional

01:52:37
authorities pretend that Uber does not

01:52:39
exist

01:52:41
so they don't chase it away but they

01:52:43
also don't promote it which is a perfect

01:52:45
playground for Uber they are they that's

01:52:48
exactly what they want

01:52:50
and they they are not interested in

01:52:52
being recognized as an official public

01:52:54
transport service for example because

01:52:56
that would mean having to comply with a

01:52:58
lot of regulations uh which they of

01:53:00
course not interested in complying with

01:53:04
in in your research about this do you

01:53:07
know if like uber uh drivers partner up

01:53:10
with the like informal Navid drivers to

01:53:13
actually try to convince clients to use

01:53:16
the informal Navid rather than the

01:53:18
flipko for example no I don't no no I in

01:53:22
this particular case they definitely not

01:53:23
I mean the Navid drivers as most likely

01:53:27
taxi drivers in Brussels they hate Uber

01:53:29
they really don't like that it exists

01:53:31
because it basically eats into the

01:53:33
market

01:53:34
um I'm not saying the taxi driver is

01:53:36
here you know some

01:53:38
angels and and uh most uh I don't know

01:53:42
uh

01:53:43
uh fun well not fun people to work with

01:53:46
or on but uh I mean

01:53:49
they they can also uh offer services

01:53:52
which are overpriced and and try to rip

01:53:54
off tourists and and or I don't know

01:53:57
people who come back home Intoxicated by

01:53:59
you know taking a very long route or

01:54:01
whatever with Uber of course the

01:54:02
advantage is that you know the price

01:54:04
before you get into the car more or less

01:54:07
but in this case no there's definitely

01:54:09
no collaboration I would say that there

01:54:11
is some conflict even

01:54:13
uh

01:54:14
uh you probably heard about that already

01:54:17
happened at least three times massive

01:54:19
strikes of taxi drivers against

01:54:21
uh some kind of effort towards

01:54:23
regularizing Uber by the Brussels

01:54:26
Brussels Capital Region authorities

01:54:32
any more questions comments

01:54:36
well it also goes without saying that

01:54:40
um at some point you will be picking uh

01:54:42
topics for your master thesis and you

01:54:46
are very welcome to pick some related to

01:54:47
transport and Mobility either supervised

01:54:50
by me or by other people there is some

01:54:51
more in the in our team and in different

01:54:54
departments as well but

01:54:56
um I don't know if I've succeeded

01:54:59
probably to some extent but not fully

01:55:03
but if this there was one thing that I

01:55:06
really wanted you to understand about

01:55:07
transported Mobility is that at least

01:55:09
from the critical geographical

01:55:10
perspective it's a really really diverse

01:55:13
field there's plenty of things to to do

01:55:16
um and there's plenty of interesting

01:55:18
things to do so I yeah I really look

01:55:21
forward to seeing your research topics

01:55:24
uh and hope that at least some of them

01:55:26
will be related to transported Mobility

01:55:28
and if you need some little push or some

01:55:31
encouragement we are always there to

01:55:33
help you with finding some interesting

01:55:34
literature for inspiration and whatnot

01:55:37
so

01:55:38
um I really really hope we meet in

01:55:40
person one day uh I hope it's not uh too

01:55:44
far in the future

01:55:45
I really hope that we can do an

01:55:46
Excursion uh even though it's on

01:55:48
transport it's interesting uh people say

01:55:51
so

01:55:53
voila I I really hope that we can do

01:55:55
that in March April May the latest so

01:56:00
until then uh I wish you all the best

01:56:03
