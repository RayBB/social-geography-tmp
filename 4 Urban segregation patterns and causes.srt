3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,399
I see some people with a laptop would

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,980
you mind to check whether the webcast is

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,680
working put your link on the link of the

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,940
link of the live stream

7
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,100
um I think it should be

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,850
it should be working I think

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,009
[Music]

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
um

11
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:26,280
because I think that uh some of you

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,259
might know me

13
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,740
and many others might not know me

14
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,880
I am experiments and I will teach this

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,000
class and the next one in urban

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,360
geography Urban social geography

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,579
and I consider myself to be an urban

18
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,159
social person that's a good a good kid I

19
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,820
think

20
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,759
and most of my research has dealt with

21
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,799
migration

22
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,799
newcomers in the city

23
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,500
segregation whiteness

24
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,100
and I've done a PhD with case studies in

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,740
kilometers and in South Africa about 70

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,680
years in Cape Town to study how white

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,220
middle class people moved to the city

28
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,260
and what kind of people they get to meet

29
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,020
uh in in the city

30
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,800
Etc

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,360
um so I've done some work on the

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,220
geographies of encounter the geographies

33
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,860
of migration

34
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,959
um and this year I have decided to work

35
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,720
less at the University and to spend more

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,420
time with my kids and more time on my

37
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,900
bike I like to cycle

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,640
um and so it means that I have reduced

39
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,099
my workload at the University and I

40
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,060
still have a 50 teaching assignment

41
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,640
um I teach social geography in the first

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,239
year Bachelor of geography I teach some

43
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,280
classes in urban geography I also take

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,819
the students on a field trip to Estonia

45
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,220
and this will be the geographers this

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,680
year and I've also done that for the

47
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,160
master in urban studies students and

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,200
two years ago was the last time I think

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,340
we did that

50
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,280
and I'm teaching a course on the city

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,099
and migration that's a title at the

52
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,720
University of Louisville so I have quite

53
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,760
some teaching assignments also

54
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,819
supervising some Master's thesis to PhD

55
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,620
thesis so that's what I'm what I'm doing

56
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,659
um I have written here in my presenters

57
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,540
notes who am I and I'm another white

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,640
male mid-aged middle class man

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,620
that you that you get to see here I

60
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,360
think this issue of positionality is

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,400
also an important one especially in the

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,560
kind of issues that I will discuss when

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,099
it comes to diversity when it comes to

64
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,140
migration what are my experiences in the

65
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,799
city

66
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,840
and so I think that's also something

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,299
important to point at and something that

68
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,860
we could discuss

69
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,879
um also

70
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,739
further in the semester like whether

71
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,459
this is something important or or not to

72
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,200
but there will be not so much time for

73
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,360
discussion today and there will be time

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,260
for discussion in the seminars and that

75
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,060
will come soon and there will also be

76
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,980
time for discussion on the field trips

77
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm going to run through two field trips

78
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,699
for the students this is for the four

79
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,740
cities and the master of urban studies

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,699
students so not for all the other ones

81
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,340
and but we have one Excursion to Antwerp

82
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,100
and one Excursion to Shell next week

83
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,160
that I'm going to run and so I wanted to

84
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,400
share some practicalities and I don't

85
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,139
like the fact that I am somehow bound to

86
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,600
my laptop but this is for the live

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,240
stream and so it's I hope that it's that

88
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,000
it's uh is working now

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,780
um

90
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,380
but so first of all next week Tuesday I

91
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,900
think 40 of you have signed up to go to

92
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,060
Antwerp is that correct who will join me

93
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,040
to Antwerp

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,840
yeah

95
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,419
um I will hand out some

96
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,419
Excursion guides and printed them in

97
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,060
color by accident I don't know how happy

98
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,479
the department will be about that if you

99
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,300
get these paper copies in in full colors

100
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,600
so you can take one if you join me yeah

101
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,220
don't take one if you don't join me

102
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,360
because then I will not have enough

103
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,100
copies for everyone

104
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,800
and what is important and that's

105
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,460
something else that I want to hand out

106
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,580
I'm living in Antwerp and so I will meet

107
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,240
you in uh enter a railway station

108
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,759

109
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,600
to be in my wallet

110
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,780
who is joining to enter and is familiar

111
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,740
with this

112
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,220
Rail Pass OR Go pass

113
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,419

114
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,699
yeah some people

115
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,940
um so I will give this uh to you and I

116
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,520
would like you for all the people that

117
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,560
join we need one line okay so it says

118
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,139
um this isn't French you can also fill

119
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,539
it in in Dutch or in English the day

120
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,320
Tuesday the date in the Belgian system

121
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,100
with day month year then the place for

122
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,440
American beef that will be Brussels and

123
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,880
then enter

124
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,160
yeah and you need lines for everyone

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,000
it's a bit complicated as

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,120
um you have tickets for those under 26

127
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,419
and other tickets for those over 26 a

128
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,699
bit more expensive

129
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,960
so I will give them to you

130
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,699
thank you

131
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
so good

132
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,080
so it's important that you meet on time

133
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,860
20 to 8 next week Tuesday we are leaving

134
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,639
rather early

135
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,440
um with a train that will have as a

136
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,800
destination

137
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,780
which is a small station to the north of

138
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,120
Antwerp but it's important that you get

139
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,759
off at Antwerpen Central

140
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,440
yeah so the group will meet 740 you take

141
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,240
you make sure that you get on the train

142
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,240
752

143
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,479
Elena and Louisa will make sure together

144
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,940
with all of you that you have a line for

145
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,780
each student you get on the train and it

146
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,419
will be platform five I guess if you're

147
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,660
late you pay for your own tickets and so

148
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,819
use let's use that as an incentive I

149
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,620
will not reimburse anyone who leaves

150
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,960
late you should travel with the group

151
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,979
and then you all arrive at the same time

152
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:19,740
according to the schedule at 8 35 and I

153
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,440
will meet you on the platform

154
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,199
yeah so that's what we do we will go

155
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,780
cycling I hope that everyone was aware

156
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,979
of that

157
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,440
it will it is November it will be cold

158
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,200
it will be wet so make sure that you

159
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,599
bring some gloves and some rain gear

160
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,659
because it might um it might be called

161
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,360
bring the Excursion guides especially

162
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,760
now that it has been printed in full

163
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,620
color because you will use that quite a

164
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,459
bit

165
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,560
and we are going to discuss basically

166
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,899
the topics of the this class and next

167
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,000
class so we will discuss segregation and

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
social mix in the field in Android

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,880
we will get to cycle about 25 kilometers

170
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,940
that's quite a bit

171
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,000
um but it has worked out every year

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,580
nicely so I trust that it will be the

173
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,320
same

174
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,959
um wear a mouth mask on the train

175
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,940
yeah I don't know what the regulations

176
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,580
will say how how we need to get around

177
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,040
in Antwerp we are quite a big group I

178
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,279
might split you up a couple of times

179
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,580
um bring a lunch or buy one in

180
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,440
Enterprises also I will give you an hour

181
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,839
to to have a lunch but we will be in

182
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,640
quite a fancy part of time so it might

183
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,440
be more complicated to find a cheap

184
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,800
place there but not impossible

185
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,720
yeah so

186
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,300
you will complete these rail passes and

187
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,820
go passes and then you will when you

188
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,560
arrive in anthrope you will give these

189
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,899
two to me

190
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,820
next week Friday I will take you to um

191
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,740
or some of you who will join me to

192
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,779
Charlotte

193
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,140
okay so a similar amount of people and

194
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,779
we will meet in the Brussels railway

195
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,839
station Central so that's important 10

196
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,720
minutes later but still quite early at

197
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,440
10 to 8. in order to be on the train at

198
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,180
seven past eight

199
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,300
yeah again the same system that say I

200
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,760
will be responsible for the rail passes

201
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,160
and the go passes if you're late you

202
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,660
will need to get in touch with a fellow

203
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,459
student to know where we are I'm not

204
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,839
going to wait for you at the train

205
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,779
station in but also you need to pay your

206
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,120
own ticket yeah

207
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,700
um we're going to hike first through the

208
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,820
city but we will also climb some of

209
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,480
these uh at least one Ash Heap in French

210
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,959
so this is a small mountain of yeah

211
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,959
like leftovers from the coal mining it

212
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,940
is quite steep it can be wet so you

213
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,339
should also have some good shoes that

214
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,100
allow you to to do that

215
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,800
bring a pen and paper and I will bring

216
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,899
you a similar kind of Excursion guide

217
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,019
probably in black and white

218
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,660
um for the shadow Excursion

219
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,000
and you can again bring a lunch or buy

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
one in Charlotte

221
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,380
do we have any practical questions about

222
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,100
these trips

223
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,700
that's a good question

224
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,740
um I think in Shelby I will end around

225
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,260
five meaning you can get back to

226
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,440
Brussels around six but I have a habit

227
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,600
to anti or to give you the possibility

228
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,339
either to get on a train back to

229
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,100
Brussels but I also suggest you to walk

230
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,459
back to Charlotte train station

231
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,440
and but if you want you can be back in

232
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,120
Brussels at six

233
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,300
um from Antwerp we will end at six the

234
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,980
very latest because that's the moment

235
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,440
when I need to give back the bikes to

236
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,839
the bike rental agency and so that means

237
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,279
that you should be able to be back in

238
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,120
Brussels at seven

239
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,019
some other practical questions

240
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,339
no and I'm looking yeah

241
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,140
no you will get a helmet you will get a

242
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,260
look

243
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,180
um if you're very eager to take your own

244
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,519
bike to Anthem it's you can do that on

245
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,079
the train and it's a bit of a hassle but

246
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,060
you will get a nice rental bike you will

247
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,800
get a helmet if you want and you will

248
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
get

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,240
um a lock for the bike as well

250
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,060
foreign

251
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,980
so I will see you next week I will see

252
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,240
40 of you next week Tuesday in uh in

253
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,060
Antwerp Central Railway Station

254
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,260
um I'm looking forward to that

255
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,420
so these are the practicalities about

256
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,399
the excursions I'm glad that I was able

257
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
to share that personally rather than

258
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,339
just another message in the canvas

259
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,500
um today you're not in session one

260
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,959
you're in session four you had an

261
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,139
introductory class you had two classes

262
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,899
on road City formation and polarization

263
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,600
in world global cities and basically

264
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,959
today we will continue a bit on the

265
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,420
theme of class three and I will we will

266
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,120
discuss segregation we will discuss

267
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,820
patterns of segregation and we will just

268
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,940
discuss causes of segregation and next

269
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,160
week I will discuss effects or

270
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,920
Consequences of sick yeah so these are

271
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,800
two classes that fit very well together

272
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,860
and there is a clear theme for each of

273
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,839
them patterns causes of segregation

274
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,540
today affects consequences of

275
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,440
segregation next week

276
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,160
I assume that all of you have read these

277
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,360
two texts

278
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,940
and have you maybe we can I can also

279
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,579
have a look who who has read these two

280
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,320
texts

281
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,079
you can be proud about it who has not

282
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,839
been able to read these two texts you

283
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,540
can also be proud about that okay so I

284
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,820
see that more people have not read it

285
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,000
not read them rather than read them

286
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,100
um for the discussion seminar I think

287
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,040
it's important that we have

288
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,800
like a shared knowledge and these two

289
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,720
texts for this week and the two texts

290
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,519
for next week will be the shared

291
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,500
knowledge together with what is being

292
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,079
shared in the class so I hope that all

293
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,880
of you will be able to read these two

294
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,060
texts and the two for next week by the

295
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,740
time we have the discussions

296
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,279
um

297
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,779
okay

298
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,040
today

299
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,339
I have basically three topics I will

300
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,500
discuss first these classical models of

301
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,440
urban form in the text by pachone which

302
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,240
was a textbook chapter there was a

303
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,579
reference to Burgess I'm going to talk

304
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,199
about Hoyt I'm going to talk about

305
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,959
Harrison Allman some classical models of

306
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,240
urban form that have been generated by

307
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,519
Chicago School Scholars in the beginning

308
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,220
of the 20th century

309
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,260
then secondly I'm going to discuss

310
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,380
patterns of segregation meaning that we

311
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,000
will discuss like how to measure

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,740
segregation and

313
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,440
how you can look at segregation from

314
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,260
different angles and then at the end of

315
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,600
the class I will discuss some causes of

316
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
segregation why is it that people lit

317
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,399
that poor and rich people live in

318
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,680
different neighborhoods of the city why

319
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,019
is it that you can find white people in

320
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,660
one part of town and people of like

321
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,540
African origin in another part of town

322
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,380
Etc

323
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,820
so this is the topic list for today and

324
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm going to start with this classic

325
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,820
Land Use model by Burgess

326
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,980
so those of you who have read the

327
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,540
textbook chapter by pachome have been

328
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,600
reading about the burgers he was writing

329
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,440
from Chicago

330
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,339
1925. I think that's important I will

331
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,199
do the live stream like this I think

332
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,820
that might also still work is everyone

333
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,399
able to hear me at the back here yeah

334
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,860
okay so that's that's going around the

335
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,680
world so what was Burgers doing he was

336
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,199
trying to understand

337
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,639
how cities

338
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,560
were looking like and what kind of

339
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,899
groups groups of people you could find

340
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,899
in different parts of the city

341
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,120
they were stating that basically you had

342
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,199
five

343
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,480
concentric rings

344
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,639
in the Heart of the City there was the

345
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,500
loop

346
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,240
um the loop I will I will discuss that

347
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,519
later it's a term from Chicago basically

348
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,260
the central business district

349
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,079
yeah around that you have the zone of

350
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,899
transition that's how you found it then

351
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,120
around in the third zone of working

352
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,040
working methods the residential Zone

353
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,920
suburban and another uh residential Zone

354
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,980
with reaching out the commuters so five

355
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,019
rings around the city

356
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,600
and why was it that you have these five

357
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,639
rings well

358
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,940
because different functions in the city

359
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,000
in different groups of people were able

360
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,040
to pay different rents

361
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,980
so the theory was that in the center of

362
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,160
the city the central business district

363
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
you found

364
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,520
for example the headquarters of an

365
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,359
office

366
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,419
because they were able to pay the higher

367
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,299
rents that you had so close to the city

368
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,740
center

369
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,500
and further away from the city

370
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,620
was the theory you would find for

371
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,780
example

372
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,640
Suburban plots

373
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,980
um what's very intense because these

374
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,020
people were able to spend to pay less

375
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,480
rents

376
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,880
for their part of

377
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,380
so this is really Theory

378
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,160
um was basically underlying this model

379
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,919
of concentric things

380
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,980
yeah this term model can be a little bit

381
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,179
confusing

382
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,980
and because it could give you the

383
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,840
impression that this is an ideal type

384
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,660
like this is how it sit all through yeah

385
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,179
but Burgers was trying to do but

386
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,640
basically to

387
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,679
simplify reality and to understand how

388
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,140
cities were not necessarily how they

389
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,320
opened it how our cities and we try to

390
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,860
simplify it and that's how a simplified

391
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,700
version of Chicago of a western City

392
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,600
looks like

393
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,020
I told you already written in 1925

394
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,020
yeah that's very important why because

395
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,840
we are at a moment in time this is the

396
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,320
population of Chicago from 1840 to 2014

397
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,980
we are at a moment in time 1925 when

398
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,500
this population of Chicago has been

399
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,660
growing through an exponential growth

400
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,940
for many many years

401
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,440
yeah and that also explains why

402
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,080
Burgess was making a model of the growth

403
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,820
of the system

404
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,880
yeah it's not a model of any City it's

405
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,100
the model of a growing city and he tries

406
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,919
to understand how this growth of a City

407
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,299
Works

408
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,020
both in terms of a growing population

409
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,940
but also

410
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,520
a city that is characterized by an

411
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,080
expanding area that is built the

412
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,460
environment

413
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,640
is growing and so it's a level of the

414
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,559
growth of the city

415
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,539
and writing from Chicago in 1925 well

416
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,820
this is a very particular growing city

417
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,700
this is a city of immigration where a

418
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,020
lot of immigrants

419
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,179
are from all over the world but from

420
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,080
Europe in particularly initially arrived

421
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,000
and where they settle

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,360
and where you see that in

423
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,020
1900 you had less than 2 million people

424
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,960
and uh you need to go only 10 15 years

425
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,780
later to find another amazing into added

426
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,780
to the population and so this is a fast

427
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,020
growing City

428
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,299
um both in terms of population and in

429
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,940
terms of the area that is built up

430
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,400
that's also expanding that's also true

431
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,080
um it's also a city that is

432
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,940
characterized by heterogeneous

433
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,640
population so what you see here is the

434
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,160
result of a survey

435
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,039
going from house to house knocking on

436
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,720
people's door and then checking whether

437
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,200
there is someone English speaking in

438
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,539
White Irish in green German in purple

439
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:48,539
Dutch in dark purple Russian in red Etc

440
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,059
and so you see that the city was

441
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,760
characterized by a heterogeneous organic

442
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,220
all these people coming from different

443
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,460
countries of origin arriving in Chicago

444
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,980
at that time okay so it's a particular

445
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,460
City that Burgers is writing from and

446
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,740
I'm saying that because I want to argue

447
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,700
that this theory that Virgos made up and

448
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,039
which he thought was Universal for

449
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,760
growing cities was in in fact

450
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,880
a theory that was mostly applicable to

451
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,179
Chicago itself yeah and so here you see

452
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,220
a couple of assumptions which are also

453
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,360
mentioned

454
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,940
uh in the in the text that you've read

455
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,679
or that you're going to read

456
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,140
the assumptions and principles that were

457
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,120
underlying this theory of the model of

458
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,120
um the growing city of the growth so you

459
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,179
see that the assumption is that there is

460
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,120
this cultural and social approach

461
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,340
of the population

462
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,799
you could also think of other cities

463
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,559
yeah in countries which are less smart

464
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,360
by this kind of diversity

465
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,980
and the second assumption is that there

466
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,440
is a commercial industrial base to the

467
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,299
economy of the city

468
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,640
could you think of other

469
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,100
basis to the economy of the city

470
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,500
that kind of other places could you have

471
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,720
rather than commercial that's true

472
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,380
tourism yeah if you go to a city that is

473
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,120
marked by two resistance for example

474
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,260
each

475
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,200
distribute could be of any importance

476
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,460
please

477
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,620
yeah while in a commercial industrial

478
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,080
city it's a meteorological But Central

479
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,440
Business districts the center office

480
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,520
during the city is dominated by a

481
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,500
touristic cities well then you would get

482
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,520
different

483
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,020
I know also saw other characters

484
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,799
based yeah then you would hit the

485
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,320
Heritage I could also Imagine like

486
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,500
cities that draw a lot of pilgrims a

487
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,260
religious basis to the city of Temple or

488
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,620
a church would be Central places Etc so

489
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,320
you can think of other kinds of cities

490
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,140
yeah and then the the idea of burgers

491
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,100
would be that this model of urban growth

492
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,860
private ownership of property economic

493
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,020
competition for space you can imagine

494
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,340
other cities

495
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,740
in the Soviet Union for example plan the

496
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,520
economy different kind of systems

497
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,220
um for expanding area and population of

498
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,400
the city many cities in in Europe are

499
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,039
nowadays marked by shrinkage

500
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,280
yeah in Eastern Germany for example

501
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,980
um Genova in Italy city that has been

502
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,020
marked by shrinkage for a very long time

503
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,940
Detroit

504
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,919
a city in North America

505
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,179
that has gone through a similar

506
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,860
fifth essential transport is equally

507
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,159
easy easy rapid and key in every

508
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,020
direction within the city

509
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,480
it's hard to imagine how that would ever

510
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,520
be possible because you will always have

511
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,980
transport infrastructure that will allow

512
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,780
you to move from one end of the city

513
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,659
much more quickly to another end than to

514
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,460
another part of the city

515
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,940
okay number five the city center is the

516
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,280
main Center for employment and therefore

517
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,659
most credible

518
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,360
people also think to many other kinds of

519
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,700
city where for example the airport is an

520
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,460
important top and you have a big

521
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,760
um big development around this Airport

522
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,799
so these things are more attractive

523
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,500
because of differences in terrain I told

524
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,659
you I did my PhD on Cape Town you've got

525
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,520
the Atlantic Ocean you've got Table

526
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,799
Mountain you can imagine that these

527
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,539
differences in terrain are very

528
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,360
important to understand how this city is

529
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,039
owned

530
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,559
you have no concentrations of heavy

531
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,700
industry

532
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,340
yeah and you have no historic survival

533
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,860
of an earlier land use pattern in any

534
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,940
District

535
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,840
there is no Heritage do you have a 19th

536
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,000
century housing or a medieval argument

537
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,179
City yeah and so

538
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,580
um verbis himself already acknowledged

539
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,400
that it hardly needs to be added and I'm

540
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,820
quoting this that neither Chicago nor

541
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,299
any other City fits perfectly into this

542
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,700
ideal ski

543
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,340
complications in Chicago are introduced

544
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,520
by the lakefront the lake in Chicago

545
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,520
so there is a difference

546
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,419
the Chicago River another difference in

547
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,419
Korea railroad lines which mean that

548
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,520
which major transport is not equally

549
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,760
easy rapidly cheap in every direction

550
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,100
and historical factors in the location

551
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,860
of industry and which might mean that

552
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,200
you have concentrations of heavy

553
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,340
industry in some parts

554
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,520
um Etc

555
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,740
and so you see the acknowledgment that

556
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,600
well I'm trying to

557
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,740
formulate a universal model of urban

558
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,120
growth but well underlying my theory are

559
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,980
a lot of assumptions and principles

560
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,700
which mean that basically I'm writing

561
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,679
uh

562
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,960
I'm writing up a model of a specific

563
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,480
City in Chicago and basically my model

564
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,080
was composed for Chicago doesn't even

565
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,760
hold for Chicago itself because there

566
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,960
are many complicated factors okay

567
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,380
um I will I will discuss this further in

568
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,539
a bit like and we

569
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,820
in in urban studies we have been going

570
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,740
through a moment where we

571
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,840
um I started to realize well many of our

572
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,539
theories are provincial when we write

573
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,520
about gentrification and we make a

574
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,159
theory of gentrification then if we make

575
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,100
a case on Brussels then we write a very

576
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,039
Western kind of perspective

577
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,039
gentrification so it's necessary to

578
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,020
de-provincialize our theories I find it

579
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,000
interesting that already 100 years ago

580
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,179
there was this awareness that well me

581
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,220
burgers I'm writing from Chicago and

582
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,380
this is important to to understand

583
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,320
um

584
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,140
so how did this model look like I will

585
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,039
run through this Central Central most

586
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,400
Central concentric ring is the group you

587
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,900
have a wider group

588
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,640
and if you've ever been to Chicago

589
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,760
you've got this Metro lines that all

590
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,279
converge in the city and where basically

591
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,919
this whole Metro is making a loop and

592
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,919
then taking back the line from where

593
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,740
it's going so you have this elevated

594
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,840
metal track

595
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,659
but in a loop in the shape of a loop and

596
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,100
so that's why the essential business

597
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,840
that speak of Chicago is called

598
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,820
so this is the place where you have

599
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,020
shopping

600
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,799
uh where you have offices or you have

601
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,840
headquarters of companies where you

602
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,140
expect to find theaters

603
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,840
um Etc because these are the functions

604
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,380
that are able to pay the highest rent

605
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,779
the highest price for the central

606
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,880
voltage why do they want to be in the

607
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,919
central location well these are all

608
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,860
functions that need to draw

609
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,360
um office workers Shoppers theater goers

610
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,419
from all corners of the city and so for

611
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,940
them it is important to be in the

612
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,419
central location that is easy to reach

613
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,419
from everywhere in this and so they want

614
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:43,860
to be in

615
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,320
the loop

616
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,240
and Chicago 1925 a picture the video of

617
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,100
ID busy streets the first skyscrapers of

618
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,340
the world in the city earlier than New

619
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,980
York and so you have basically the first

620
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,440
city where you have this

621
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,460
um how to say that like this classical

622
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,960
uh Central Business districts from a

623
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,480
North American Town Syria it's all

624
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,400
skyscrapers

625
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,980
so Zone one the Central Business this

626
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,240
around this you have

627
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,919
The Zone in transition the zone of Truth

628
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,539
basically what you find there is factors

629
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,460
why do these factories want to be

630
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,120
located there they also rely on labor

631
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,539
that needs to come in by a trend by

632
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:40,740
Metro

633
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,620
Etc so they also want to be in a central

634
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,960
location that allows them to bring in

635
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,320
workers from all corners but they are

636
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,140
not able to pay these high prices for

637
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,059
lands but these functions on the

638
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,460
previous slides were able to offer them

639
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,480
and some of you find a second ring in

640
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,539
which you have these factors

641
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,679
not only factories you also find

642
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,880
neighborhoods there

643
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,760
yeah who wants to live close to these

644
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,120
factories nobody this is very polluted

645
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,700
this is very dirty these are very bad

646
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,179
living circumstances so who ends up here

647
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,899
the first generation of immigrants from

648
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,659
different countries of origin yeah and

649
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,460
as soon as these people are able to

650
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,779
perform a move to a better part of town

651
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,240
then they will do so

652
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,100
they have to do some of these names that

653
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,080
you find on these pictures

654
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,559
little hell tells quite a bit

655
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,080
but also the fact that for example here

656
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,440
we have Little Sicily so this is a part

657
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,919
of town where these Sicilians arrive but

658
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,740
that was formerly little Sweden

659
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,000
yeah so you see how one group of

660
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,880
newcomers moves out and is Then followed

661
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,820
by a new group of people from another

662
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,100
country of origin that was what Burgess

663
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,299
was noticing in 1925. and so this is the

664
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:16,320
part of the Chicago close to the central

665
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,559
business District close to the loop

666
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,320
in the middle of all these factories

667
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,860
where people who just landed off the

668
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,940
boat

669
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,279
from Europe arrived and so you have

670
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,779
subsequent

671
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,299
groups ethnicities of newcomers who

672
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,580
arrive

673
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,880
people who have been able to climb the

674
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,419
social leather they will move out of

675
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:45,299
these areas and they are able to afford

676
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,240
a better home

677
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,740
further away from these factories and

678
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,440
they are also able to afford the commute

679
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,200
between home and the world so there's

680
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,520
also a price

681
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,940
to be paid for this so the purpose is

682
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,620
writing there about the zone of

683
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,580
independent working man's hopes

684
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,700
and in his vocabulary which is the

685
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,520
respectable working class is working

686
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,520
it's living in the episode

687
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,700
and so I found it interesting that

688
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,720
um

689
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,080
like here six miles north west of the

690
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,279
loop

691
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,799
West yeah so we are moving in that

692
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,140
direction about 10 kilometers out of the

693
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,320
loop you also have an area of Chicago at

694
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,520
that time where you had quite some

695
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,580
belgians living yeah and Burgess was

696
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,220
also writing about the belgians many of

697
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,260
them were janitors so they also have

698
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,740
like a specific profession uh that many

699
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,320
of them were known

700
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,200
and they also had a clip so you see here

701
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,260
1921 all belgians are equal

702
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:58,140
oh the um to build a club for belgians

703
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,380
celebrating Belgium space and Belgian

704
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,299
Traditions you have the Saint John

705
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:06,320
bergman's Church Cynthia

706
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,179
in Chicago and so up to today you can

707
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:12,419
visit this neighborhood that was marked

708
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,519
by belgians and in the past

709
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,799
yeah but you also had neighborhoods

710
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,320
where you had many Germans or many

711
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,380
Russians or many Italians who had been

712
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,539
able to plan this social leather and who

713
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:28,080
had been able to out with further away

714
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,740
from this

715
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,580
I've also shown you this map of this

716
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,380
survey going door to door there was a

717
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,799
lot of heterogeneity even in streets but

718
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,720
some neighborhoods were also marked by

719
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,140
this ethnic groups

720
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,140
and then as you go further away from the

721
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,240
loop you get to more Suburban less dense

722
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,460
developments and here you see the

723
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,640
neighborhood of Mount prospects about 25

724
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,240
miles north west from the loop so we are

725
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,059
moving about 40 kilometers out of the

726
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:10,139
route now 30 to 60 Minutes commute to

727
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,719
the loop by train and so the moment that

728
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,179
these trains are being trained lines are

729
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,280
being built you see this kind of

730
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,040
suburban developments and then you see

731
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,359
and

732
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,659
find prospects 1917

733
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:27,899
this is a cape to commemorate the 50th

734
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,699
anniversary

735
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,980
but you also see who is living there

736
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,099
long twist Swedish families who have

737
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,379
arrived quite early and will be able to

738
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,080
find this social media that will arrived

739
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,359
a little Sweden but then we moved to the

740
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:46,020
Zone respectable working men's homes has

741
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,139
very discovered who have been able to as

742
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,179
they climbed the social level we have

743
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,440
also been able to

744
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,619
to this Suburban developments in between

745
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,399
four part

746
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
IES

747
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,220
I'm sorry further further red

748
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,060
part of it is becoming more expensive

749
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,619
yeah but you need to you need to see it

750
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:20,220
uh rent for like you need to pay dollars

751
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,900
per square meter

752
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,900
and so closer you get

753
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,119
to the city center the 10 service

754
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,859
development

755
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,320
and so for that reason it's not about

756
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,540
life what what you can afford but it's

757
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,060
how much you are willing to pay per

758
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,500
second

759
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,900
yeah and so these developments closer to

760
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,480
the sensor are much more dense

761
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,280
yeah so that explains why this picture

762
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,599
and curve is still going down

763
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,660
Burgers so the concentric zone model

764
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,540
and and a theory that has

765
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,200
is still being being being used but even

766
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,359
today if you read about newcomers and

767
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,480
cities and neighborhoods of arrival and

768
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,500
people still refer to Ferguson

769
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,540
conceptualized his arrival of newcomers

770
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,660
in Chicago and the kind of neighborhoods

771
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,960
that they were going through as they

772
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,420
climbed the social touch

773
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,520
yeah

774
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,700
um but you also have other models

775
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,880
um I'm still before the second World War

776
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,920
avoids another researcher who studied

777
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,839
142 American cities

778
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,359
and who stated in the beginning of his

779
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:45,540
paper that so far reaching are the

780
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,960
changes in our population pattern and

781
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,359
social structure that it can well be

782
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,640
asked whether theories of City growth

783
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,460
and structure formulated for the private

784
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,099
enterprise economy of the late 19th and

785
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,920
20th centuries is not referring to

786
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,079
Burgers but it could be will be

787
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,440
applicable in a future society that may

788
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,900
be of a fundamentally different nature

789
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,880
what happens between 1925 and 1939 in

790
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,180
America what kind of changes could be so

791
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,460
important that you that they have an

792
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,460
impact on the model of uh

793
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,619
yeah the depression so this is about

794
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:32,160
crisis a moment of economic crisis

795
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
yes and when you look at

796
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,660
I will go a couple of slides back

797
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,880
when you look at population growth

798
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,320
and in Chicago then you see that this

799
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,339
crisis 1929 the 1930s but this has a

800
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:57,440
clear impact also on the population of

801
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,740
as people are eager to immigrate to a

802
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,660
country in crisis the government is also

803
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,119
more strict on who can come

804
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,160
Etc and so

805
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,460
there is a big economic crisis that also

806
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,020
means that there is less migration

807
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,000
whether it's related to less migration

808
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,859
to the states

809
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,599
there are also other

810
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,220
phenomena

811
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,460
yeah so Boyd was writing himself a new

812
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,740
theory of Simply grade growth may be

813
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,500
necessary to fit the effects of a period

814
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,260
when cities grow more slowly

815
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,660
yeah that's what I told you already but

816
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,359
also when Automobiles and airplanes

817
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,480
remove dependency on fixed rails

818
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,440
the car becomes much more important if

819
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,980
you can imagine that a City built for

820
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,380
car drivers looks quite different from a

821
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,780
city that is built for people who take a

822
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,420
tram or a Metro or a train

823
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,700
and he also adds that what is also

824
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,320
different is that there's more

825
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,359
government control and Taxation for

826
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,760
fighting costs for the benefit of the

827
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,099
poor this is a graph that tells you

828
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,480
something about

829
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,260
taxation of the top internal rates in

830
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,820
the states and so you see that this has

831
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,460
been going through quite some changes

832
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,400
yeah and then as described as

833
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,619
when America was hit by crisis that

834
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,720
there was an urge to to have more

835
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,540
effects more income tax to this highest

836
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,820
now what that means is that government

837
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,119
can also intervene more in-house in

838
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,920
infrastructure

839
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,500
etc etc

840
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,540
um so a couple of changes that these

841
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,520
cities have been going through and so

842
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,760
art is saying well these models made for

843
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,240
cities of a particular kind remember

844
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,480
these assumptions of burgers do not hold

845
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,720
true in the cities that I am studying in

846
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,940
the 1930s it's 140. City speakers we see

847
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,900
a lot of different kind of processes

848
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,960
so voids came up with a sector

849
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,180
a sector theory saying that well you

850
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,440
still have this Central business

851
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,980
district in the city because around this

852
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,200
they do not have a couple of

853
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,380
drinks but you have sectors

854
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,260
yeah and the assumption is that when the

855
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,060
city grows

856
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,900
each of these sectors will grow and so

857
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,859
if you have to the now in this case to

858
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,099
the east

859
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:39,780
sector in which the richest people are

860
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,119
living and the assumption is that when

861
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,400
these group growth or the population of

862
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,040
the city grows that this sector will

863
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,220
also grow to the east

864
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,380
and so you have a couple of different

865
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,339
sectors high class medium

866
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,980
which are also organized by the

867
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,160
transportation

868
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,820
infrastructure and so you would have

869
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,339
industry factories concentrated along

870
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:12,300
rivers canals Rail lines on roads

871
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,280
immediately next to that you would have

872
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,420
low class residential areas just like

873
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,220
burgers assumed

874
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,500
but Burgers assumed that these factories

875
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
and the lowest

876
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,780
low-class areas would be located in a

877
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,780
concentric ring and boy it was saying

878
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,420
well if you look at cities in the 30s in

879
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,060
America and the sector model comes

880
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,339
closer to reality so this is a better

881
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:43,160
way to simplify how cities are looking

882
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,280
um so sectors rather than concentric

883
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,619
Rings what is also important is that

884
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:53,220
there's much more emphasis on Class A

885
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,220
medium class low class high class while

886
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,500
Burgers was often writing from these

887
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,940
ethnic groups Italians Sicilians uh

888
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,240
Germans Russians Swedish people arriving

889
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,260
in the city

890
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,800
um

891
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,079
okay a third model

892
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,260
is the one by Harris alone and this is a

893
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,099
graph

894
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:23,119
or a picture that comes from their paper

895
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,780
we moved on the 1945 and you see that in

896
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,760
their paper they make a reference

897
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,099
already which is concentric so novel by

898
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:35,359
Burgess they refer to the secret Theory

899
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,760
by Boyd and then they come up with their

900
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,980
own model which is called the multiple

901
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,839
nuclear model of a city

902
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,579
um and you see indeed that they have

903
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,400
this kind of jigsaw puzzle that

904
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,440
represents the city for them in which

905
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,480
you still find number one a central

906
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,260
business district and next to it and the

907
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,880
next with the district with wholesale

908
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,520
light manufacturing but you also see a

909
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,220
couple of other notes that are important

910
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,460
to understand the city for example seven

911
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,640
and outlying business

912
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,400
yeah so this is an important difference

913
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,740
between these two models and that one

914
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,560
there's not just one Central business

915
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,660
district which you also have important

916
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,780
business districts in other parts of the

917
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,800
city

918
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,119
for example in London even in in the

919
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,880
history

920
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,980
they have this economic heart

921
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,520
of the city of the city close to Tower

922
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,319
Bridge and you've got a political Heart

923
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,900
of the City close to Westminster epic

924
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,500
but there is a distance between while in

925
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,180
this traditional models you would expect

926
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,940
them to be concentrated and close to

927
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,500
each other in the central business

928
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,180
district

929
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,599
I also refer to Chicago I say there are

930
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,940
a couple of

931
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,060
Industries or universities which are in

932
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,579
very different parts of the city than

933
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,800
this Burgers model

934
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,040
and expected so they refer to area of

935
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,640
heavy industry and posted the

936
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,400
the river and the lake and then also

937
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,819
this University of Chicago to the South

938
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:24,420
which is then again like the hook of uh

939
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,180
like an area in which you find middle

940
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,760
class people University lecturers and

941
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,380
people working

942
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,540
in a part of time where you would not

943
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,099
expect them to and so they also look at

944
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:39,599
these kind of spikes in the big

945
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,420
difference saying that well normally

946
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,579
according to burgers this would always

947
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,280
go down

948
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,520
by the the further you get from the city

949
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,000
center the lower is bitter and curve

950
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,599
would be the lower the price per square

951
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,900
meter that people companies or other

952
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,780
functions are willing to fail but then

953
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,000
Arizona would say well you always find

954
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,280
this kind of local spikes for example

955
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,220
local shopping centers not all the

956
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,200
shopping is happening

957
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,119
the central business district and so

958
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,800
also you can find these local shopping

959
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,000
centers or a satellite City and around

960
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,579
which you find again like is a

961
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:26,760
decreasing can be transfers yeah so a

962
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,460
third model here is an omen where you

963
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,960
have multiple nuclei

964
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,720
more than one Center basically and you

965
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,240
get this kind of jigsaw puzzle to to

966
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,980
simplify an urban form

967
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,700
in this Theory they only consider those

968
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,560
10

969
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,420
or well or in that case in that City

970
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,400
yeah every city will have a different

971
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,099
kind of home but their main argument is

972
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,920
that these models are too simplistic

973
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,560
and not everything is radiating from one

974
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,119
Center but in practice you will always

975
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,440
find

976
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,140
it so that's why reality looks more

977
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,040
complex than in decimals

978
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,200
okay

979
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,319
um

980
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,280
why to go back to Chicago why to go back

981
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,020
to theories that have been written 100

982
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,960
years ago I think it's interesting to

983
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,240
make Urban geographers or people who do

984
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,300
Urban studies who made them think about

985
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,180
the form of a city and who is living

986
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,980
where

987
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,800
and so on the left you have here a map

988
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,480
of Chicago

989
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,420
nowadays and each dot basically

990
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,599
represents one person

991
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,819
lost Maps Detroit automatic Network

992
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:54,180
finds maps for other American cities

993
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,420
like this and so you you see here that

994
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,819
basically the different colors on the

995
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:03,260
map represent different people who

996
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,540
self-identified with different races

997
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,280
slash ethnicities

998
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,780
yeah so and I think you find people

999
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,940
self-identified as the white in the year

1000
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,880
2010 in blue you find people who

1001
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,300
self-identified as black in green people

1002
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,599
who self-identify as Asian and in Orange

1003
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:29,599
people who self-identify as Hispanic

1004
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,240
in the American context uh race slash

1005
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,700
ethnicity corresponds very much with

1006
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,900
clocks

1007
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,140
that's if you would have a map with

1008
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,040
socioeconomic classes then you would

1009
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,720
also find that most of these

1010
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,720
neighborhoods which turn out to be

1011
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,040
thinking

1012
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,980
and you have a majority of

1013
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,240
self-identified as why but this will

1014
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,300
also be the better of any business

1015
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,640
and that the neighborhoods with people

1016
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,280
who self-identified black could be

1017
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,240
underprivileged

1018
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,760
so now my question for you is which of

1019
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,579
these models of urban form the

1020
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:09,839
concentric

1021
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,180
remodel by Burgess

1022
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,640
a sector model by voids for this

1023
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,700
multiple nuclear model can you find on

1024
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,200
the map

1025
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,920
foreign

1026
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,540
models on the map so when you look at

1027
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,380
this

1028
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:36,200
closely what what do you see who sees

1029
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,040
you find this kind of sectors

1030
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,420
yeah

1031
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,300
and in heat I have the metro map of

1032
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,040
Chicago this will be the center of

1033
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,619
business districts you have like pieces

1034
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,000
of pie

1035
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,119
that starts from the central business so

1036
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,060
indeed much of Chicago nowadays

1037
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,220
is still looking like voids would have

1038
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,900
predicted between these different

1039
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,000
sectors

1040
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,200
corresponding with different populations

1041
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,020
groups different socio-economic classes

1042
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,140
low-class high-class medium class to use

1043
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,020
the vocabulary line at Five Points so in

1044
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,339
this you can still find that yeah

1045
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,339
Burgess

1046
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,480
okay so what is representative

1047
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,460
where it is considered to be relevant

1048
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,099
100 years ago we still make maps like

1049
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:49,560
this so for some reason we still find it

1050
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,500
important please

1051
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,920
but when you look at the pattern

1052
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,880
yeah

1053
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,880
pleasure

1054
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,200
uh

1055
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:14,460
okay so indeed it's very hard to see

1056
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,280
concentric sense the ring one because

1057
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,140
there will be very few residents of the

1058
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,640
central business district

1059
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,160
it's also hard to spot concentric Rim 2

1060
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,260
it's also a large response concentric

1061
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,079
ring three but then when you move

1062
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,960
further away from the city center it's

1063
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,079
ring number four and room number five

1064
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,119
where Burgers would have expected the

1065
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,200
better off

1066
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,119
residents who have climbed a social

1067
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,760
leather you can still see that even

1068
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,640
today these are indeed the places where

1069
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,940
you find almost exclusively white

1070
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,880
dominated neighborhoods and so this this

1071
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,260
is still the case

1072
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,240
and so this ring number four and five

1073
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,700
are still there

1074
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,380
is an omen

1075
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,260
multiple nucleus

1076
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,260
clusters

1077
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,880
yeah you can indeed find for example if

1078
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,619
you see an example

1079
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,180
like is there is

1080
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,260
okay so indeed you have a cluster of

1081
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,200
this Hispanic people who self-identify

1082
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,960
as Islamic in the South and that's

1083
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,400
around this uh calumet's River

1084
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,140
industry area

1085
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:48,420
yeah you also have a cluster of whites

1086
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,160
in a sector that is

1087
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,559
blue that is dominated by people who

1088
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,119
self-identified as black and this is

1089
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,540
this a University of Chicago premises

1090
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:04,380
so up to today you can still see

1091
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,339
uh remnants of this Harrison Omen model

1092
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:11,160
and also the reasons why they wanted to

1093
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,099
refine or give more detail to this

1094
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:17,660
concentric green model and sector

1095
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,059
so I hope that these models

1096
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:23,819
make you think about how different

1097
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:27,059
cities look like and that they also make

1098
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:29,880
you aware of well in different types of

1099
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,839
cities

1100
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,000
you have different ethnic groups

1101
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,280
different social economic classes

1102
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,220
make taking out different parts and this

1103
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,619
can be very different but Brussels for

1104
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,980
example is a city where poverty is very

1105
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,319
Central

1106
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,079
we have the medieval city but then when

1107
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:51,599
you go out of the vehicle you get to the

1108
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,420
19th century development related to

1109
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,520
industrialization this is where you find

1110
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,680
the poorest neighborhood versus cattle

1111
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,920
Beach

1112
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,540
these are poor districts

1113
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,780
very close to the medieval

1114
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,819
you have other kinds of cities for

1115
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,819
example Paris where you have much more

1116
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:17,460
wealth close to the city center and

1117
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,020
where you have much of the poverty and

1118
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,119
very peripheral locations

1119
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,819
and so it is interesting to compare

1120
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:26,400
different cities and to understand where

1121
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,520
is poverty located where do different

1122
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,400
racial ethnic groups live in in the city

1123
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,260
and so when you do that

1124
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,140
you will also be able to make a a

1125
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,839
simplified model of the city that you

1126
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:44,880
are familiar with for the city that you

1127
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,040
want to study and you will also come to

1128
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,960
an understanding that these burgers and

1129
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,839
poison Arizona bubbles are very

1130
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,960
simplistic and that in different

1131
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,059
countries in different cities you would

1132
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:59,220
have very different models

1133
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,619
and I have a couple of examples

1134
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:04,740
this is one from Piercy that is also

1135
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,800
used in the textbook where you have in

1136
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,460
the British complex is Council Estates

1137
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,940
yeah built on peripheral land and so in

1138
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,940
a concentric ring where Alice harrisman

1139
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,760
and Burgess would expect private

1140
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,339
Suburban housing we also have these

1141
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,800
Council Estates just like these born

1142
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,800
years in the French context where much

1143
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,319
of the poverty is peripheral

1144
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:37,079
yeah while that contradicts Birds

1145
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,300
the Chinese

1146
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,920
city was ever a word of the change

1147
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:48,359
my pronunciation will be very cool okay

1148
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,160
nobody cities in China also fast growing

1149
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,819
in China you basically have a new look

1150
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:03,680
for an urban citizenship

1151
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,140
foreign

1152
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,960
and you have villages

1153
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,940
which

1154
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,599
were taken up by farmers

1155
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,420
which are rural pieces of land where you

1156
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,400
have people with this brutal citizenship

1157
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,640
with the rural living when people from

1158
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,940
the countryside migrate to the city they

1159
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,180
are able to take up residence in these

1160
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,020
old villages

1161
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,359
their citizenship if I may say it like

1162
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:39,180
that allows them to stay in this area

1163
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:43,380
so you have in many Chinese cities parts

1164
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,599
of the city that look like that where

1165
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,359
you have a very formal part immediately

1166
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:51,480
next to a part of the city that looks

1167
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,420
much more informal much more dense and

1168
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,819
that's because when the city grows over

1169
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:00,180
this Countryside that these brutal

1170
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,440
villages

1171
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,800
from the past become these villages in

1172
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,119
the city where you have a lot of

1173
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:09,119
newcomers arrived and so these Chinese

1174
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,579
cities the model of the Chinese City

1175
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:14,819
would look very differently from Burgers

1176
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:18,660
because you have these areas that

1177
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,599
used to be Villages or centers of

1178
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,160
religious and where you have people with

1179
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,960
immigrating from Countryside from other

1180
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,099
parts of China who arrived there uh

1181
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:35,640
to this change I think it means

1182
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,740
something like Village in the city

1183
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,359
and these are foreign

1184
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,240
the African City

1185
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,500
at the flag of from 1962 very different

1186
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,079
again because transport is much more

1187
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,359
complicated

1188
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:57,359
and so rich people prefer to live close

1189
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,880
to the citizen and the poorest of the

1190
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,380
food who arrive from the countryside

1191
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,140
will arrive at the very ends of the city

1192
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,359
a very peripheral locations where it

1193
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:09,839
takes you two or three hours to get

1194
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:14,099
so these cities look different again

1195
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:15,900
Mike Davis

1196
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,540
Los Angeles you might have heard of The

1197
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,119
Chicago School burgers for example that

1198
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,380
you might also have heard of those

1199
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,380
angels group or of course modern

1200
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:27,540
photographers writing from Los Angeles

1201
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,240
and Mike Davis and who wrote an

1202
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,940
interesting book in 1992 and trying to

1203
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,260
make the 1998 UFC who made a model of

1204
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,500
how that Los Angeles looked like in the

1205
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,280
90s yeah and you might have heard of

1206
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,720
Skid Row

1207
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,940
it's a part of the city where you have

1208
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,099
thousands of homeless people

1209
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,619
and living on the streets just next to

1210
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:54,240
the central business district of Los

1211
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,040
Angeles say this is the zone of

1212
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,859
transition and this is where the poorest

1213
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:00,839
of the poor live

1214
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,180
immediately next to the central business

1215
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,260
district

1216
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,780
but you also end up at that time these

1217
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,720
gated to developments

1218
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,059
at the periphery of the city where you

1219
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:15,240
had the richest of the rich living in

1220
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,700
these gated suburbs so you could also

1221
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,819
see that basically this

1222
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:23,220
borders between the different Rings were

1223
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,440
being walled and fortified

1224
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,660
enclaves

1225
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,359
so he was trying to make a mobile

1226
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:35,160
of Los Angeles in the 1990s

1227
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,740
barred by this desperate poverty some

1228
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:41,339
parts of the city and then also this

1229
00:58:41,339 --> 00:58:42,000
um

1230
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,119
both in other parts

1231
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,099
and in the end there are still a lot of

1232
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:49,680
burgers in this model there's still the

1233
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,299
Central Business districts that are

1234
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:53,660
still core and there is still this

1235
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,619
poorest of the poor Living Community

1236
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,319
mixed not in the zone of transition

1237
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,020
between which the factories and then

1238
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,420
this little hell or Little Sicily that

1239
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,880
people living on the streets

1240
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,819
and then the the more you move out of

1241
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:10,440
the city center the Richer this

1242
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,339
neighborhoods get it's also very much

1243
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:18,540
so try to make a model of Los Angeles in

1244
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,540
1998

1245
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:27,059
yeah I I

1246
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:29,460
one hour ago I took out a slide with a

1247
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,280
bottle for talent and again trying to

1248
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,640
understand for the post-socialist city

1249
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,700
and look like but then also

1250
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,980
using Talon as an example but also

1251
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,480
trying to understand like what kind of

1252
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,940
developments do we see in these

1253
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,099
socialist cities and then in these

1254
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,859
post-socials and how can we try to

1255
00:59:49,859 --> 00:59:52,559
generalize that simplify

1256
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,440
and so the attempts to make a model is

1257
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,140
an attempt to simplify reality and to

1258
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,740
try and understand what is particular

1259
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:04,319
about cities and what makes Los Angeles

1260
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:08,160
different from Chicago in 1925

1261
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,400
so you also have indeed bubbles for

1262
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,940
European cities this was a British City

1263
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:17,460
kearsely in this Council Estates but you

1264
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,740
could also make a model for Stockholm

1265
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,599
and try to think like what is specific

1266
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,819
about Stockholm I'll just look forward

1267
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:27,140
compared to other cities

1268
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,540
not that I know because this this

1269
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:43,020
attempt has been like it's very much

1270
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,940
um and indeed you could think how these

1271
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,000
assumptions that Burgers Sunday

1272
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,099
or the diet stand up on the slide and

1273
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:52,559
they finally the textbook whether some

1274
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,700
of them are

1275
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,720
at typically

1276
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,059
like for example this idea that cannot

1277
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:03,059
be an early invention so European cities

1278
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,380
tend to have

1279
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,720
a long history and so for that reason

1280
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,460
there are always parts of the city

1281
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,460
equipment is already something you have

1282
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,240
a growing City

1283
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,819
there's also much more State

1284
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:25,339
intervention

1285
01:01:25,339 --> 01:01:28,619
so we could think like how the European

1286
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:31,319
city would be different from uh these

1287
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:32,940
assumptions of burgers and what that

1288
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,540
would mean then for the model works

1289
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,760
I have no bundled but it could be an

1290
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,559
interesting it could be an interesting

1291
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,920
exercise

1292
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:51,260
and is it something like it

1293
01:01:58,619 --> 01:01:59,880
so

1294
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,780
it might also

1295
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,980
um

1296
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,480
in different areas

1297
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,540
um

1298
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,359
but some was less strict and less

1299
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,119
regulated and it is nowadays yeah when

1300
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,160
you also when you have a city that's

1301
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,660
growing that fast

1302
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,819
that is having one million extra

1303
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:45,240
inhabitants in the very short period of

1304
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,819
time yeah then the city grows very

1305
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:49,740
organically I guess and it's also very

1306
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,420
hard as a planner to keep up with the

1307
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:56,119
pace but the city is scrolling it

1308
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,420
regulation

1309
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,579
when exactly it was taken

1310
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:05,119
States

1311
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,870

[Music]

1313
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,220
okay and can you read it

1314
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,059
or not snow

1315
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,400
well I will ever ever look whether I can

1316
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,240
I can see

1317
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,660
okay I see some comments yeah

1318
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,579
in the example from China how does the

1319
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:34,559
ownership of people with State work is

1320
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,520
the city grows over these villages

1321
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,400
[Music]

1322
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,400
um

1323
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:47,400
okay I will I will I will it's it's time

1324
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,599
for a break

1325
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:50,339
um I will have a look at I will have a

1326
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:52,819
look at what I find it in public

1327
01:03:52,819 --> 01:03:56,220
that it's hard for me to check this live

1328
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,799
stream that also I also need to get out

1329
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,740
of PowerPoint to check that out I am

1330
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,420
teaching mostly for the people here and

1331
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,960
I hope that the live stream Works more

1332
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,480
I'm at let's say five minutes break

1333
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,720
um it's four past six on my clock here

1334
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,540
so let's start again uh nine past six or

1335
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:18,260
ten past six

1336
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:23,839
let's see

1337
01:04:47,299 --> 01:04:50,420
what's up

1338
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,020
tomorrow

1339
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:01,929
[Music]

1340
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:24,500
there's no difference

1341
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,200
foreign

1342
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,660
okay

1343
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,780
thank you

1344
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:42,000
I've jumped foreign

1345
01:08:07,799 --> 01:08:10,799
something

1346
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:15,140
thank you

1347
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,679
has heard

1348
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,100
one day

1349
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:52,799
myself

1350
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,699
yes

1351
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:36,560
[Music]

1352
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,800
it is

1353
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,260
let's talk

1354
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,260
questions

1355
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,980
let's continue

1356
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:18,840
with the conclusion for the first uh

1357
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,800
hour of the class

1358
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:25,460
let's go through it it seems

1359
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:29,340
that Urban differentiation the fact that

1360
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,080
rich and poor little different

1361
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,580
neighborhoods the fact that you have

1362
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,620
people from different ethnicities

1363
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,860
different generations of newcomers that

1364
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,080
they live in different neighborhoods

1365
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,120
somehow that seems to be some

1366
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,780
characteristic of most if not all cities

1367
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:49,040
I've been showing you models from Africa

1368
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,739
Los Angeles Chicago

1369
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:55,140
and United Kingdom

1370
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,820
and I've been talking about this model

1371
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:00,060
of the Socialist or both socialists it

1372
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,620
seems that in each of these levels there

1373
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:04,380
is this idea that different groups of

1374
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,840
society whether you define them in

1375
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,760
socioeconomic classes or different

1376
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,060
ethnicities or

1377
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:14,460
self-identify as a racist but these

1378
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,840
different groups they have different

1379
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,120
parts of a city

1380
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,540
but it also seems the difference local

1381
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,780
features impact upon perfect forum

1382
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:28,199
for example this Lake in Chicago

1383
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:29,940
and you could see that there are

1384
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,280
references to the wind's Direction in

1385
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,280
some of these models migration patterns

1386
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,460
Etc and obviously also local policies

1387
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,100
and a transport system

1388
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,620
a snake intervention in housing this ID

1389
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:46,500
for example is canceled Estates for the

1390
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,040
following years

1391
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,300
and restrictions of mobility in a in the

1392
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,260
Chinese complex system determining where

1393
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:00,420
uh to live or where you could set your

1394
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,480
kids to school uh strategies to counter

1395
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,140
policies so that also means that most of

1396
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,360
these models of urban form even if they

1397
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,040
say this is the model of the American

1398
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,860
city that they somehow wear birthmarks

1399
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,420
that they are situated in a specific

1400
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,440
space

1401
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:21,060
in a specific type of Chicago or 1920s

1402
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:24,420
was a model of the growing city and the

1403
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:27,480
place already 10 years later

1404
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,820
and this American economy has been hit

1405
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,400
by crisis this model did not fall true

1406
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,560
anymore because the city was not growing

1407
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,960
at that fast pace and so it's always

1408
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,800
about situating these models in time and

1409
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,780
space and so that also makes it

1410
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,780
necessary to provincialize

1411
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,920
theories so much

1412
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,000
um I'd like to show you some exam

1413
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,980
questions to make you think like how how

1414
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:55,159
will I ever

1415
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:57,300
make you

1416
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,580
uh like what kind of questions could you

1417
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,500
expect from this and this is a question

1418
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,140
that I've asked in 2016.

1419
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,179
and you have the model of the South

1420
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:09,000
African post-apartheid City by a

1421
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,860
particular author and you know how

1422
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,699
familiar all of you are with this video

1423
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,920
in South Africa repeal of this Advantage

1424
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,179
loss

1425
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:20,840
ES

1426
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,140
and so you there are some references to

1427
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,880
this Legend

1428
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,880
and then I ask you which elements of

1429
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,100
burgers voids and Harrison

1430
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:37,679
do you recognize in this model boxes

1431
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,380
yeah so there could be a way to check

1432
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,020
whether you've understood what these

1433
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,880
models are about whether you're able to

1434
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,159
apply that and to another one

1435
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:01,440
I found it in a book but I don't

1436
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,620
remember

1437
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:07,380
if you would have a look I know I do it

1438
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:12,239
I can look it up now

1439
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,980
both publicly

1440
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:17,480
I can tell you also because

1441
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,620
um

1442
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:22,080
so first hour these classical models of

1443
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,000
Earth but also some more recent

1444
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,480
place with these World models

1445
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,000
but I'm going to discuss now is patterns

1446
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,380
of segregation

1447
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,300
yeah

1448
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:40,140
how can we look at segregation in cities

1449
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:44,040
and I will use the definition by two

1450
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,000
American Authors again Messi and mental

1451
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,540
Douglas Messi and Nancy dancer to

1452
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,120
American sociologists who wrote a book

1453
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,100
called American apartment

1454
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,620
so you see this reference to the South

1455
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,140
African cities but in the thinking on

1456
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,179
segregation this book has been quite

1457
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:04,380
important

1458
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,719
and so you see here what is the

1459
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:07,800
definition

1460
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,600
first of all they focus on the

1461
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,360
residential segregation I could also

1462
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,659
discuss segregation in Leisure spaces

1463
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:18,659
how many people 's Force for the places

1464
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:20,880
where people spend their Leisure Time

1465
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,120
our desegregated or I could look at work

1466
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,860
segregation to people of different

1467
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,920
socio-economic classes meet each other

1468
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,219
but most of the work on segregation

1469
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:37,980
focuses on residential section what is

1470
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:40,739
residential segregation it's a degree to

1471
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:43,800
reach two or four groups however you

1472
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,739
find it live separately from each other

1473
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:49,260
in different parts of the urban

1474
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,580
environment

1475
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:54,239
adult Solutions and what you've seen in

1476
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,040
these models that I've been showing you

1477
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,739
in the previous hours is that in most

1478
01:16:58,739 --> 01:16:59,699
cities

1479
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,000
different groups

1480
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,179
whether you define them in a

1481
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:07,920
socio-economic way

1482
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,060
for in this ethnicity race

1483
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,640
self-identifying

1484
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,040
that indeed in all of these cities

1485
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,860
different groups live in different parts

1486
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,260
of the city and so in each of these

1487
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:24,900
cities where this models are

1488
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,600
right it would make sense to look at

1489
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,000
residential circulation

1490
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,100
but what is important is that messian

1491
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,040
doesn't want to make this more complex

1492
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,900
and they say most of the research on

1493
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,239
segregation has been too simplistic

1494
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,340
because it looked at segregation in one

1495
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,020
particular way

1496
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:46,140
and so what I'm going to do with you now

1497
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,679
is to look at or discuss five dimensions

1498
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,179
of segregation

1499
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:53,159
a pharmacy and then these are called

1500
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:56,659
evenness exposure concentration

1501
01:17:56,659 --> 01:17:59,400
centralization and clustering

1502
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,699
and most of the research on segregation

1503
01:18:01,699 --> 01:18:05,460
is discussing evenness and so I will

1504
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:09,719
also look at it what is evenness

1505
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,940
evenness refers

1506
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:14,580
and I'm just reading what you see on the

1507
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:17,219
slide now refers to the differential

1508
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:20,820
distribution of two social groups

1509
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,940
among aerial units in a city

1510
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,280
and so a minority group

1511
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,800
is said to be segregated if it is

1512
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,659
unevenly distributed over aerial units

1513
01:18:32,659 --> 01:18:36,120
evenness is not measured in any absolute

1514
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,120
sense but is scaled relative to some

1515
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,380
other group

1516
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:44,340
so we are able to say and this city

1517
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,260
this is the example that you see there

1518
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:50,580
the lights are segregated from Plex

1519
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:54,719
or the low socioeconomic classes if you

1520
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,060
may call that same like this are

1521
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:00,020
segregated from

1522
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:04,199
rich is segregated from so you always

1523
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:06,480
need these two

1524
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:11,960
so you see here that you can have index

1525
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,940
I will use this here

1526
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,460
an index of this similarity can be

1527
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,860
calculated and I will give you two

1528
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,199
examples

1529
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:24,719
some years this goes rather well and

1530
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,219
sometimes

1531
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:28,620
this goes rather wrong imagine that you

1532
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:31,140
have a city that is made up of

1533
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,940
four districts

1534
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,300
and in each of these

1535
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,640
you have 75

1536
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:43,440
whites and 25 legs

1537
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,920
what would be

1538
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,840
the index

1539
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,159
of this similarity when I use

1540
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,659
the major layer

1541
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:56,520
we need to paste

1542
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:00,540
off of the sum yeah that is what this

1543
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,840
great Sigma is mean and now we need to

1544
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,060
for each of these neighborhoods we need

1545
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,940
to say what is the black population in

1546
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,640
an area

1547
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:14,100
divided by the total black population 25

1548
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:18,620
25 100 minus

1549
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:23,040
75 the white population in area one

1550
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,719
divided by the total white population

1551
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,100
what do we have here for one

1552
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,640
neighborhood

1553
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:34,400
zero

1554
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:37,560
I need to calculate the sum for of this

1555
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,960
measure for each of these neighborhoods

1556
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,780
so that will be zero plus zero plus zero

1557
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:47,040
to zero one half of 0 is 0.

1558
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,400
the index of this similarity would be

1559
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,659
zero

1560
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:54,060
or zero percent

1561
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,980
this corresponds with the effect that

1562
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,600
you need to move

1563
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,400
zero percent

1564
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,800
of the population in order to get an

1565
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,380
even distribution of white and black

1566
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:07,380
across the city because you have an even

1567
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,300
distribution in each of these four

1568
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:13,560
neighborhoods you have as many whites as

1569
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:17,239
you have in other parts of the system

1570
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,360
um you can also look at another exhaust

1571
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,699
where you would have

1572
01:21:23,699 --> 01:21:27,960
100 Plex living in one neighborhood

1573
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,199
100 whites in another

1574
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,900
100 whites in another and another 100

1575
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,360
white in another name

1576
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,300
if you would make the calculation now

1577
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:41,159
then you would get to one

1578
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:43,140
not going to do that with you but for

1579
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,880
those who

1580
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,860
are able to do this this means the

1581
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,260
absolute number of this so if you get to

1582
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,360
a negative number here then it becomes

1583
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,060
positive again when you calculate it it

1584
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,640
will be

1585
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,980
then the number will be one

1586
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,140
yeah

1587
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,179
um because you can I can still do that

1588
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:07,199
with you there's a sum of 100 the number

1589
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,000
of blacks in the first neighborhood

1590
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,679
minus 100 the total number of legs minus

1591
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:16,820
the number of whites

1592
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:20,880
and for each node each of these

1593
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,880
neighborhoods you will get uh to the

1594
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:24,980
number

1595
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:28,500
uh one and here you will get one third

1596
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:32,159
one third one third total two uh half of

1597
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,860
two so one meaning you need to move 100

1598
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:36,659
of the population

1599
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:39,600
in order to get an even distribution of

1600
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,940
these population groups across the city

1601
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,920
either you move

1602
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,380
33 Flex

1603
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,320
from this neighborhood to this

1604
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,520
neighborhoods

1605
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,920
yeah and then you can get if you move 33

1606
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,260
to each of these then you get an even

1607
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,179
distribution of blacks across the city

1608
01:22:57,179 --> 01:22:59,580
or you move all the white people through

1609
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:02,100
that black neighborhood and then you

1610
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,960
would also get to it even descriptions

1611
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,120
of people across the city according to

1612
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,380
this neighborhoods

1613
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,659
yeah and so this index of this

1614
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:11,460
singularity

1615
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:15,780
ranges from zero even distribution to

1616
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:18,480
one very uneven distinction

1617
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,520
and basically it corresponds with the

1618
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,320
percentage of people that you're with

1619
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,380
oof in order to get an even distribution

1620
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,900
of people across different neighborhoods

1621
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,780
and so this may be complicated but you

1622
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:33,719
can just look at the practice so how

1623
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:35,820
does this look like you would get to a

1624
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:36,840
number

1625
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,540
this is this percentage

1626
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:40,500
[Music]

1627
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:41,340
um

1628
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,100
and what you see here for example is

1629
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,179
that

1630
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:48,980
um so zero plus an even distribution

1631
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:51,679
that was this example

1632
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,560
150 uneven yeah so the more you move to

1633
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,460
the right on this slide more uneven the

1634
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,280
cities are so what is particular is that

1635
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,960
you see that first of all American

1636
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,480
cities tend to be much more penetrated

1637
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,420
than European ones

1638
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,360
yeah so segregation when you look at the

1639
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,239
dimensions even this

1640
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:17,699
then you find out that in American

1641
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:21,020
cities the poor for example are living

1642
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,420
much more in particular parts of the

1643
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:26,760
city and in the European context they

1644
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,040
are a bit more spread across different

1645
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,900
parts of the city

1646
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,100
yeah

1647
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:36,300
and so you see here for different cities

1648
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,000
for different population groups

1649
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,280
you see how this has been

1650
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,440
yeah and again you always need to

1651
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,239
compare it with another population group

1652
01:24:45,239 --> 01:24:47,760
so what has done is the tour of ends

1653
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,380
verb compared to it than the ones who

1654
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,020
are not considered

1655
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:55,440
okay and so it's also interesting for

1656
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,900
those who join me to enter

1657
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,820
to see that according to these

1658
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:04,980
statistics poverty enhancer in 2005. was

1659
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:08,000
also much more

1660
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,100
unevenly spread across the city and so

1661
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,600
you had particular neighborhoods where

1662
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,760
you had uh

1663
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,040
that were marked by poverty much more

1664
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,560
than in other Europeans

1665
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,540
this will also be a scale issue for

1666
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:25,080
Belgium and we have very small

1667
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,380
statistical sectors that will be part of

1668
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:29,520
the explanation

1669
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,040
scale is important when these sectors

1670
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,500
grow they will mask some of the

1671
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,960
concentrations of poverty of Health that

1672
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,600
you've been getting the statistics are

1673
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,440
defined

1674
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:47,719
so this measure of evenness

1675
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:51,120
some more numbers

1676
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,179
again you see that

1677
01:25:53,179 --> 01:25:56,900
90 and so you get close to one

1678
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:00,300
Birmingham Bangladesh I read there all

1679
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,179
time Bangladesh

1680
01:26:02,179 --> 01:26:06,239
so apparently it is Bangladeshi in UK

1681
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,199
cities

1682
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,560
are living very much in particular

1683
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,239
neighborhoods of the city and in these

1684
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,980
neighborhoods

1685
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:16,020
you would find almost exclusively

1686
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:19,320
Bangladesh and that explains why you

1687
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,239
would need to move almost all these

1688
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:23,699
Bangladeshi to other neighborhoods if

1689
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:24,900
you would like to get to an even

1690
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,920
distribution of Bangladeshi in UK cities

1691
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,040
and so you see how this measure is being

1692
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,980
used in order to say something about

1693
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,860
residential segregation in these

1694
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,460
different cities

1695
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:45,000
poverty in Copenhagen the first Quinta

1696
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,600
quintile will be like the first 20 of

1697
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,239
the people according to the income

1698
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:54,320
income distribution is much less

1699
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,300
segregated and it's spread much more

1700
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:00,540
evenly across the city than it is in

1701
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:04,139
only other cities that are listed there

1702
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:06,540
so do you understand what this measure

1703
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:11,600
of evenness unevenness means

1704
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,520
okay I get now to these four other

1705
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,460
dimensions so what messian are arguing

1706
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,139
is that we have been looking at

1707
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:21,480
segregation mostly through this lens of

1708
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,340
evenness

1709
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,100
there are also four other times

1710
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,199
which are worthwhile looking at the

1711
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:31,800
question I'm sorry for that example with

1712
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,520
the 100 black presidents and one in this

1713
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,600
record

1714
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,600
I didn't think what does it

1715
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,060
what does it mean for it to be one-third

1716
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:47,300
for the for my residential conception

1717
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:52,380
well I'm I'm just I am just for each of

1718
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,600
these neighborhoods

1719
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:59,159
I am calculating I didn't want to go too

1720
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:03,480
much into this I am calculating this

1721
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,360
and I start from the black neighborhoods

1722
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,100
they're the measure or the number will

1723
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:11,159
be 100 divided by 100 the total number

1724
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:13,739
of likes minus net neighborhood in our

1725
01:28:13,739 --> 01:28:16,500
zero whites divided by total number of Y

1726
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,199
is 300. that will be one

1727
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,600
for the white neighborhoods

1728
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,699
yeah and I have three of them

1729
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:25,560
the measure will be there are zero

1730
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:29,460
blacks and I have minus 100 the number

1731
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:31,440
of Lights in that neighborhood divided

1732
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,320
by the total number of bites 300.

1733
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:38,880
yeah so I get here to 1 divided by three

1734
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:43,980
so I get one plus one third one plus one

1735
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:46,800
third plus one third two

1736
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,600
two divided by two is one

1737
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,040
but it doesn't say anything about its

1738
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,900
neighborhoods I'm calculating something

1739
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,420
at the scale of the city and for that

1740
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:59,460
for that I need to calculate this

1741
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,860
measure for these four neighborhoods

1742
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:04,560
oh okay

1743
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,800
and then I so I I think I kind of

1744
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,659
realize

1745
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:13,020
and then I need to make the Sun

1746
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:16,199
of this number in each of these so that

1747
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:19,139
will be some of

1748
01:29:19,139 --> 01:29:21,659
one plus

1749
01:29:21,659 --> 01:29:24,659
perspective

1750
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,699
and I need to divide it

1751
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:30,840
right

1752
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,340
that's why

1753
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,699
so the index of the similarity is one

1754
01:29:35,699 --> 01:29:39,420
in each this case 100 percent meaning

1755
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:40,679
that

1756
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:44,760
either 100 percent of flex or 100 of y's

1757
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,280
need to move in order to get to an even

1758
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,500
distribution of both whites and Bricks

1759
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,520
across the city

1760
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:57,020
okay

1761
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,620
four other yeah

1762
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:09,569
[Music]

1763
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,239
yeah that's the percentage

1764
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,760
so then this would be 100

1765
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,219
and this would be zero and if the index

1766
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:33,000
of this similarity would be 0.5

1767
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,219
then you would have 50 percent

1768
01:30:35,219 --> 01:30:38,699
and that would be 50 years

1769
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:41,340
so you move close to one and you are

1770
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,380
close to

1771
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:45,239
this is a measure that you would often

1772
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:47,420
find

1773
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,440
I could also be often

1774
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,739
checked like our segregation

1775
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:55,440
uh changing across time

1776
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,239
that would be the index of the

1777
01:30:57,239 --> 01:31:00,300
similarity for first Handler has moved

1778
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,460
from

1779
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:05,580
0.40 to 0.50 meaning poor people got

1780
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:08,340
more concentrated over time

1781
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:12,199
for more cigarette sorry yeah

1782
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:16,560
I got less evenly distributed across

1783
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,739
five

1784
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,940
okay four other

1785
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,340
Dimensions I'm going to move through

1786
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,900
them rather quickly

1787
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:28,760
residential exposure reversively

1788
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:32,580
sorry refers to the degree of potential

1789
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:33,960
contacts

1790
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:37,260
yeah or the possibility of interaction

1791
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,620
in this case

1792
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:42,659
in each of the neighborhoods there is a

1793
01:31:42,659 --> 01:31:45,480
similar degree of exposure here there is

1794
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,520
when when these people limit their lives

1795
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,560
to the neighborhood there will be no

1796
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,120
exposures

1797
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,820
yeah and so this degree is

1798
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:56,219
pretty close to evenness but not

1799
01:31:56,219 --> 01:32:00,659
completely because for exposure and the

1800
01:32:00,659 --> 01:32:03,540
number will also be depending upon the

1801
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:06,360
total size of these communities

1802
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,239
if the total black population in the

1803
01:32:09,239 --> 01:32:10,800
city is very low

1804
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,260
then the chances that you will get to

1805
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:15,179
meet a black person are are lower

1806
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:19,020
already yeah so the size of the group is

1807
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:20,699
important if you would make a measure

1808
01:32:20,699 --> 01:32:23,840
for exposure

1809
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,460
concentration Dimension number three

1810
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:28,800
refers to the relative amount of

1811
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,500
physical space occupied by a minority

1812
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,719
group in the urban environment

1813
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:36,239
this will be again be dependent upon the

1814
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,040
size of this one

1815
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,139
we have here Manhattan

1816
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:42,360
and we have in these different colors

1817
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,060
again these different ethnic or racial

1818
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:48,120
groups or people self-identifying with a

1819
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:52,040
particular group and so you see that in

1820
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:55,500
shades of purple you have the Asian

1821
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,320
population and so you have

1822
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,440
China done and that's where most of

1823
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,980
these Asians are concentrated they take

1824
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:08,219
up a very small amount of space this is

1825
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:11,520
a dense neighborhood and most Asians

1826
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,800
living in Manhattan or living in that

1827
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,920
particular part of an exit and so

1828
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,360
concentration

1829
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,639
the relative amount of physical space

1830
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,880
occupied by a minority group

1831
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:27,980
number four centralizing

1832
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,600
it relates to the degree to which a

1833
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,120
group is spatially located near the

1834
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,159
center of an earth

1835
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:37,620
I don't know what the center of New York

1836
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,780
would be but if you say it's Wall Street

1837
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:43,139
then these Asians are living very

1838
01:33:43,139 --> 01:33:45,600
centralized

1839
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,760
and while black Africans

1840
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,179
in the case of New York are not living

1841
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:53,960
centralized

1842
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,580
the same goes for this example of

1843
01:33:56,580 --> 01:34:00,360
poverty in Brussels poverty is very much

1844
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:03,139
centralized

1845
01:34:03,239 --> 01:34:04,679
neighborhoods which are marked by

1846
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:08,520
poverty are close to the city center

1847
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:11,780
Parisian case poverty is very much

1848
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:14,880
decentralized that's much more an issue

1849
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,440
of this peripheral Bond years

1850
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:22,560
and in the last Dimension is clustery

1851
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,380
the degree to which is

1852
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:28,260
um aerial units inhabited by minority

1853
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:32,219
members and join one another or not

1854
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:34,980
I don't know how familiar you are with

1855
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:35,940
New York

1856
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:38,520
but I remember walking out of the metro

1857
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,280
station and Flushing close to Flushing

1858
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,040
Meadows where you have the tennis

1859
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,420
tournament and that was another

1860
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:48,060
neighborhood and that was very much

1861
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:51,360
marked by a presence of Chinese people

1862
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,060
yeah so you have

1863
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:54,920
um

1864
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,179
clusters of

1865
01:34:57,179 --> 01:35:01,199
at least two clusters of Agents one in

1866
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,060
this Chinatown Manhattan and then

1867
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:06,480
another one somewhere here in Flushing

1868
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,600
yeah and so is

1869
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,780
um the presence of Asians is it cluster

1870
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:16,860
no because there is two neighborhoods

1871
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:18,480
um which are quite far away from each

1872
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,659
other

1873
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:26,219
evenness exposure

1874
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:28,920
what was it centralization concentration

1875
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:33,000
plus two and so I could also ask you

1876
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,219
in the exam

1877
01:35:35,219 --> 01:35:37,739
to discuss

1878
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:40,260
the three most relevant dimensions of

1879
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:42,300
Messi and length are the ones that you

1880
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,719
still remember

1881
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:47,179
um out of these five to discuss

1882
01:35:47,179 --> 01:35:51,179
socio-economic segregation requests

1883
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:54,840
is over the clustered or not

1884
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,880
centralized

1885
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,040
is it concentrated

1886
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,440
or is there an evenness

1887
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,600
yeah the data might allow you to say

1888
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,460
something about it or not

1889
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:11,940
um I already told you when I pointed at

1890
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:15,920
this High numbers of unevenness in enter

1891
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,020
But scale is very important

1892
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:21,900
yeah if this is

1893
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,840
a pattern of rich and poor

1894
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:27,900
then you will only detect it as

1895
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:30,960
segregation when you are able to study

1896
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,560
it at the scale of these

1897
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:36,600
specific neighborhoods and if your

1898
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,540
statistical units are this big

1899
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:41,940
then it would be then this would be a

1900
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:44,639
very even when you're able to study it

1901
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:45,420
at

1902
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:49,860
this scale then this is a very uneven

1903
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:53,520
and so the more refined these statistics

1904
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,520
allow you to go the higher one would

1905
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:59,880
assume these levels of segregation or

1906
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,760
evenness and evenness will also be

1907
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:06,239
so scale and the scale through which you

1908
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:09,600
look so is something very uh important

1909
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,280
as well

1910
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,440
I saw a hand somewhere at the back I

1911
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,520
don't know where the description is

1912
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,300
still relevant yes

1913
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,080
um

1914
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:42,719
well I could imagine for example where

1915
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:45,020
you have a CBD

1916
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:48,300
and where do you have four neighborhoods

1917
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:51,600
around the CBD parked by poverty

1918
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,120
and you would say that poverty is

1919
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:55,620
centralized

1920
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,780
but it's not clustered

1921
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:02,900
and it is also is it concentrated then

1922
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,980
relative amount of space yeah

1923
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:10,020
they are related to each other but

1924
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:12,659
there's still something distinct about

1925
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:14,520
it you could also have concentrations of

1926
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:17,760
poverty which are very decentralized

1927
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,159
I still put the poor take a very little

1928
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:23,159
space but this is far away from the city

1929
01:38:23,159 --> 01:38:24,060
center

1930
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,679
and then the question could still be

1931
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:28,260
whether this poverty is clustered

1932
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,179
whether you have in the east of the city

1933
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:31,679
or

1934
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:35,460
districts which are adjacents

1935
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,380
to each other where is poverty is

1936
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:42,120
concentrated or whether this poverty is

1937
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,880
also decentralized

1938
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,219
but also not clustered and not

1939
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:50,100
conceptual and so you you could you

1940
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:53,520
could imagine a

1941
01:38:54,739 --> 01:38:57,239
is centralized

1942
01:38:57,239 --> 01:38:59,520
and you would also expect it to be

1943
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,900
somewhere close to it

1944
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:07,400
or not about for for

1945
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,840
groups of people in the city

1946
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,860
like

1947
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,860
um

1948
01:39:24,739 --> 01:39:27,900
and you would say poverty is centralized

1949
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,460
in

1950
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:32,340
the poor people are centralized in

1951
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,800
Brussels rich people are not because

1952
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,360
they live mostly on the periphery

1953
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:58,520
something yeah

1954
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,300
well then it will still be relevant to

1955
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,719
say that

1956
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:07,820
okay so five dimensions of segregation

1957
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:11,159
which also allow you to speak

1958
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:13,500
with a little bit more detail about the

1959
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,980
social differentiation that you find

1960
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:18,960
so it's not only about evenness

1961
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:21,120
people living in different neighborhoods

1962
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,400
of the city you can also discuss

1963
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,100
concentration clustering centralization

1964
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:28,620
exposure

1965
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:31,380
you have another question sorry are you

1966
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:33,719
starting with the confiscation

1967
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:36,360
um does it like matter like the portion

1968
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,600
like the size of the population like I

1969
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,400
can imagine a city that they're just not

1970
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,860
very many very few people are poor there

1971
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,719
and then you could have a couple of

1972
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:48,540
neighborhoods well and

1973
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:50,760
it would be called concentrated but you

1974
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,460
could also Imagine a situated

1975
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:56,820
power of many people yeah I must admit

1976
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:59,639
that I I don't know exactly how this

1977
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:01,440
would be measured and how you would

1978
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,739
operationalize such a measure but here

1979
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:06,780
it will be about

1980
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:09,000
like the size of the group

1981
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,360
how how many Chinese do you have to be

1982
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,040
about the density so they were talking

1983
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,320
about the tower it will also be if they

1984
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,900
take a less square meters if they live

1985
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,880
um but I don't I don't know how you

1986
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,000
would exactly operationalize that in

1987
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,400
this kind of way

1988
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,980
but for me the important thing is that

1989
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:33,239
you understand that there are different

1990
01:41:33,239 --> 01:41:34,860
dimensions so that you can understand

1991
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:35,880
this

1992
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,460
uh spatial differentiation between rich

1993
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:41,219
or between like

1994
01:41:41,219 --> 01:41:44,219
or between male and female or between

1995
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:45,719
Global sexual

1996
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:46,920
but

1997
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,900
she can look at it in many different

1998
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,880
ways that you would be able to study it

1999
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,840
through these fine language

2000
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:58,260
for me that's that's uh that's important

2001
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:00,300
and I will not ask you how to measure

2002
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:02,880
that's around to how to operationalize

2003
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:03,960
that

2004
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,820
I hope that you understand that it can

2005
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:08,280
be meaningful

2006
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:11,040
um to do this and that this is for

2007
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,780
example uh

2008
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:15,119
figure from the work of this festival's

2009
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,400
photographer from Belgium who said well

2010
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,639
you have different kinds of cities

2011
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:22,500
topological and dramatic cities and it

2012
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,659
matters whether the rich for example

2013
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:26,880
still need to you could imagine cities

2014
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,739
where rich

2015
01:42:28,739 --> 01:42:31,500
do not need to come who do not need to

2016
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,260
speak to for example in the Brussels

2017
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:36,420
case these poor neighborhoods are so

2018
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:40,679
closely really so closely

2019
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:41,940
um

2020
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:44,639
located to these neighborhoods where

2021
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,679
rich people work for example

2022
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:48,420
that you will get a lot of conflicts

2023
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:50,760
around around space but in other kinds

2024
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,580
of city that would not necessarily be

2025
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:55,500
the case yeah and so for that for that

2026
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:58,739
reason these kind of Dimensions do

2027
01:42:58,739 --> 01:43:01,159
matter

2028
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:03,540
and I could I could ask you to apply

2029
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:06,900
that to a particular City

2030
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,719
okay 17 minutes left to discuss the

2031
01:43:09,719 --> 01:43:12,480
causes of segregation so why is it

2032
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:16,199
that different population groups take up

2033
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:19,560
different parts of the city

2034
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,719
I guess that all of you have

2035
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:24,840
some kinds of ideas what could it be

2036
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:27,060
about like what kind of explanations

2037
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:30,139
with Uber why is it that rich and poor

2038
01:43:30,139 --> 01:43:32,540
black and white

2039
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:36,840
Hispanic Asian people of

2040
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,239
virgin people of a different class that

2041
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:41,100
they live in a different part of the

2042
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:42,179
city

2043
01:43:42,179 --> 01:43:44,940
why is that

2044
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:48,300
example when it comes inspiration or

2045
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,800
incoming

2046
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,980
City they will often just choose the the

2047
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,679
neighborhood

2048
01:43:54,679 --> 01:43:57,840
agency something that helps them find

2049
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,260
work

2050
01:44:02,219 --> 01:44:05,000
system

2051
01:44:05,219 --> 01:44:07,820
around

2052
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:11,000
for the country

2053
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,900
same language

2054
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:22,100
supermarkets or other services that are

2055
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:24,360
created for the purpose of this

2056
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,900
International

2057
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:29,699
you have another explanation

2058
01:44:29,699 --> 01:44:33,780
I mean uh probably the difference in the

2059
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:36,560
house and choices

2060
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:41,719
for example infrastructure uh

2061
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,960
okay so it could be about what you're

2062
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:48,480
able to afford and the financial limits

2063
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,980
that you have it could be about the

2064
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:54,480
choice to live amongst people like you

2065
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,739
as possible

2066
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:09,619
they said that some agents don't

2067
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:15,540
know okay

2068
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:20,040
okay

2069
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:21,420
um yeah

2070
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:23,580
um there are many there are many

2071
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:26,340
explanations and it is it is

2072
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:29,040
uh what is important for me that I'm

2073
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,500
going to try to do in a very short

2074
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:34,080
period of time is to run through a

2075
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,960
couple of typical explanations but I

2076
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,760
find important is and that's why I'm

2077
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,440
showing you this graph I think you've

2078
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:43,040
seen it already in some of the previous

2079
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:46,860
classes about Professor crosses

2080
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:48,960
um so what is important for me is that

2081
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,659
different geographers or

2082
01:45:51,659 --> 01:45:54,780
Urban thinkers or people working in the

2083
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:56,460
domain of perfect Studies have been

2084
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,159
coming up with different explanations

2085
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:01,440
that have often it matters very much

2086
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,900
from which sub-discipline

2087
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:06,840
that you're looking at and so feminist

2088
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,440
geographers have been

2089
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:13,159
pointing at different explanations of

2090
01:46:13,159 --> 01:46:17,880
segregation then Marxist geographers

2091
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:22,020
yeah so for that reason it is important

2092
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,480
to situate these theories to explain

2093
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,520
segregation

2094
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:29,639
on this match and my take on it is that

2095
01:46:29,639 --> 01:46:31,619
one explanation is not better than the

2096
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:33,960
other but in order to understand what is

2097
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:36,119
happening we need to look at potential

2098
01:46:36,119 --> 01:46:39,300
limits of people and Marxist will have a

2099
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,880
big theory about it and but also a

2100
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:42,840
choice

2101
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:46,280
and it will be mostly these

2102
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:49,159
days

2103
01:46:49,159 --> 01:46:52,440
who are eager to explore the preferences

2104
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,400
of people

2105
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,280
and why people want to live in a

2106
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,840
particular neighborhood and they will

2107
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:58,860
also then

2108
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:01,080
go to interview escape with people why

2109
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,780
is it that you move

2110
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:05,639
and so my point is I think it's

2111
01:47:05,639 --> 01:47:07,560
important that you

2112
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:10,260
unravel these different theories made up

2113
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:11,699
by these different thinkers from

2114
01:47:11,699 --> 01:47:15,000
different disciplines

2115
01:47:15,239 --> 01:47:19,139
um quantitative geographers in the 60s

2116
01:47:19,139 --> 01:47:21,480
were not so interested explanations of

2117
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:24,420
segregation but they had a rich set of

2118
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,719
mapping tools to understand these

2119
01:47:27,719 --> 01:47:29,340
spatial patterns

2120
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,380
but they were not so interested in

2121
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,060
explanations

2122
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:37,260
ecological models Burgers she would go

2123
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:40,380
and read Burgess 1925 concentric zone

2124
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:42,540
model why do these different population

2125
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,940
groups can look in different parts of

2126
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:47,400
the city almost like you would have

2127
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:50,100
these Pioneer of vegetations right

2128
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:52,860
imagine a mute area of land first you

2129
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:55,619
will find grass and then you would find

2130
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:58,619
shrips and as the shrubs grow the grass

2131
01:47:58,619 --> 01:48:00,239
cannot survive anymore because there's

2132
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,179
no lighting

2133
01:48:02,179 --> 01:48:04,739
for the for the grass and then you would

2134
01:48:04,739 --> 01:48:06,659
get these big trees and these shrubs can

2135
01:48:06,659 --> 01:48:09,960
also not survive so you would have

2136
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:13,080
competition amongst different types of

2137
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:14,580
vegetation you could have competition

2138
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:16,500
amongst different populations

2139
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:19,560
you would have Invasion the most desired

2140
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:22,619
parts so we talk about ecological models

2141
01:48:22,619 --> 01:48:25,920
because when you read these

2142
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,560
um 100 year old theories that often you

2143
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,560
find these analogies with

2144
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,960
um ecological models

2145
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,960
for vegetation

2146
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:40,760
or the survival the fittest

2147
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:44,100
so ecological models they draw on

2148
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:46,520
theories of expansion competition

2149
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,600
Invasion succession of different

2150
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,159
countries

2151
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:53,460
technology to what you find in among

2152
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:55,320
plants

2153
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,960
for Marxist geographers different

2154
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:01,440
neighborhoods different

2155
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:04,920
build environments are parts of circuits

2156
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:06,060
of capital

2157
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:08,639
and so to understand why different

2158
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:10,560
neighborhoods are produced for different

2159
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,980
people we need to understand the flows

2160
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:16,920
of capital David Harvey would would say

2161
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:19,080
and

2162
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,199
um the circuits in which this built

2163
01:49:22,199 --> 01:49:24,000
environment features

2164
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,880
for instance I'm not going to discuss

2165
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,020
this whole

2166
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:31,800
this whole figure but for example to

2167
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,260
understand

2168
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:37,080
supervisation we also need to understand

2169
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,960
the what they call from the accumulation

2170
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:43,260
regime in which this supervisation came

2171
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:44,280
about

2172
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:47,040
and how for example after the second

2173
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,860
world war in Belgium

2174
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:51,900
supervisation was promoted by the state

2175
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:54,000
also because it was a start of a

2176
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,460
consumption spiral when you suburbanize

2177
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,199
you need a car

2178
01:49:58,199 --> 01:50:01,860
so people will buy more cars you will

2179
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:04,199
need a fridge because this local shop is

2180
01:50:04,199 --> 01:50:06,420
far away you will need a freezer yeah

2181
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:08,280
and so there's a whole consumption

2182
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,860
spiral that starts when people

2183
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:13,199
suburbanize and so in order to

2184
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:15,900
understand why supervisation of the

2185
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:18,000
middle classes was promoted in Belgium

2186
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,460
after the second world war we need to

2187
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:23,100
understand the accumulations regime in

2188
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:26,159
which this functions or

2189
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:29,520
who understands why neighborhoods are

2190
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,679
being gentrified to understand the

2191
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:33,480
landscape because many of you have

2192
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:35,880
pluses by material by clicking and as

2193
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,380
well then he will explain you how this

2194
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:39,000
rant Gap works

2195
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,239
yeah so he tries to understand when you

2196
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:44,340
when you look at gentrification through

2197
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,920
a random perspective and say well the

2198
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,300
fact that you have

2199
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:51,900
an invasion now of gentrifiers to to

2200
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:54,300
borrow this word from Burgers to

2201
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:56,340
understand that you need to understand

2202
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,800
the brand Gap and the fact that profits

2203
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,900
can be made in this neighborhoods so

2204
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:04,020
this is part of capital accumulation so

2205
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,900
radical Marxist geographers will focus

2206
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:09,480
on the fact that you have the rich in

2207
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:12,239
the suburbs or that you have the rich in

2208
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:13,920
this gentrifying neighborhoods they will

2209
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,020
try to understand how that fits within

2210
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:19,199
this process of capital accumulation

2211
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:22,199
better explanation of segregation will

2212
01:51:22,199 --> 01:51:24,360
therefore be rooted in the circuits of

2213
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:28,400
capital that's Harvey with strong

2214
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:31,980
in the text by my campaign you will read

2215
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:34,760
about the Neo Weber which there are more

2216
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:37,500
constraints to people than only these

2217
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,420
Financial constraints

2218
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:42,000
it's also about discrimination it's

2219
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,860
about the social capital when you have

2220
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:46,020
how you hear about houses that

2221
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:49,139
production etc etc and so you will read

2222
01:51:49,139 --> 01:51:51,540
about these different

2223
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:53,820
um resources that might be important in

2224
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:55,199
finding that way

2225
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:58,320
and then also the constraints that link

2226
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,900
to that

2227
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:03,080
what you have there at the bottom is

2228
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:06,480
discrimination by uh people in the real

2229
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,619
estate business

2230
01:52:07,619 --> 01:52:10,380
for different population groups in

2231
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:13,619
Belgium you see that there are some

2232
01:52:13,619 --> 01:52:16,580
significance

2233
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,260
numbers

2234
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:21,300
so it's not only about the financial

2235
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:23,880
resources it's also about your last name

2236
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,040
and whether that's Dutch or French or

2237
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,619
whether that is an Arabic name that will

2238
01:52:28,619 --> 01:52:31,199
impact upon how easy it is for you to

2239
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:34,260
find an apartment or a place to buy in

2240
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:37,400
in Belgium

2241
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:40,440
behavioral geographers they are

2242
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,659
interested in the preferences

2243
01:52:42,659 --> 01:52:44,940
and the perceptions and the

2244
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:48,300
decision-making of individual so for

2245
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:50,420
them to explain

2246
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:52,860
supervisations and the fact that these

2247
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:54,659
middle class families move to the

2248
01:52:54,659 --> 01:52:58,739
suburbs they will think about push and

2249
01:52:58,739 --> 01:53:01,020
pull factors why do these people prefer

2250
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:02,340
to leave the city

2251
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:04,199
it is polluted

2252
01:53:04,199 --> 01:53:07,380
is overcrowded it's you have all the

2253
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:09,739
grind them

2254
01:53:09,739 --> 01:53:13,080
now why are people attracted to the

2255
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:14,760
Circuit so there are different reasons

2256
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:15,540
for them

2257
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:18,320
but in order to understand

2258
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,820
segregation you also need to understand

2259
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:22,980
the preferences of these different

2260
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:25,440
populations it's not only about

2261
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:28,199
restraints

2262
01:53:28,199 --> 01:53:30,360
it's not only about capital accumulation

2263
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:32,699
it's also about different groups of

2264
01:53:32,699 --> 01:53:35,100
people preferring to live in different

2265
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,739
kinds of environments as students will

2266
01:53:37,739 --> 01:53:39,659
also be segregated from non-students

2267
01:53:39,659 --> 01:53:41,639
because we have a certain many of you

2268
01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:43,500
will have a similar set of preferences

2269
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:46,679
that make you not live in the suburbs I

2270
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:48,239
guess but that will make you live closer

2271
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:51,480
to the university and closer to places

2272
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:55,260
where interesting things are happening

2273
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:59,040
and then you also read in this text by

2274
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,159
Ronald

2275
01:54:01,159 --> 01:54:04,440
and you also read about ethnic cultural

2276
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:06,000
if you could also look at these

2277
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,820
preferences through an ethnic lens and

2278
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:10,380
for example

2279
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:12,600
um to explain why

2280
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:17,100
people of Moroccan Turkish origin in the

2281
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:18,840
city of antwer why they live in

2282
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:21,239
particular neighborhoods you will need

2283
01:54:21,239 --> 01:54:23,340
to understand better Financial

2284
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:26,340
restraints many of them would be rather

2285
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:29,900
poor and so they are forced to live in

2286
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:32,820
in key parts of the city or cheaper

2287
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:33,960
parts

2288
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:35,760
but you also need to understand their

2289
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,380
preferences and you can also look at

2290
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:39,719
that through an ethnic lens and many of

2291
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:41,940
these Moroccans will be eager to live

2292
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:44,159
close to a mosque or to his opposed to

2293
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,619
Turkish failure or close to a Halal

2294
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:48,800
Butcher and that makes them

2295
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:51,840
particles it could also look through

2296
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:54,540
these preferences where you could look

2297
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:56,940
at these preferences through an ethnic

2298
01:54:56,940 --> 01:54:58,800
list

2299
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,860
use the same lens to understand why

2300
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,320
more and more these Moroccan families or

2301
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:07,020
people or families of origin also move

2302
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:08,460
to the suburbs

2303
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:10,699
there will might also be

2304
01:55:10,699 --> 01:55:14,820
a preference really to ethnicity for

2305
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:16,679
example

2306
01:55:16,679 --> 01:55:19,800
um who studied this in the answer

2307
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:22,260
context found out already quite some

2308
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:24,179
time ago but

2309
01:55:24,179 --> 01:55:26,639
in these ethnic neighborhoods as there

2310
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,260
are also being called you also have very

2311
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:30,600
tight networks of social control

2312
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:33,119
so to move out of these neighborhoods is

2313
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:36,659
also too out of this to move away from

2314
01:55:36,659 --> 01:55:38,820
the social control in these areas so you

2315
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:40,980
could have another preference that is

2316
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,960
linked to this definition

2317
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:47,400
um so the ethnic cultural approach where

2318
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:49,380
you look at these preferences through an

2319
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:52,860
ethnic lens and obviously it can also be

2320
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:55,500
criticized

2321
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,600
both modern geographers they will try to

2322
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:01,580
understand how housing is important in

2323
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:04,639
identity kind of ways in which you

2324
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:07,800
conceptualize yourself and the meaning

2325
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:09,960
that housing or living in a particular

2326
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,600
part of the city gives to you so you see

2327
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,840
here a book entitled the platform the

2328
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,100
meaning of house

2329
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:20,580
and housing is more than just a roof

2330
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:23,580
above your head it's also about boom and

2331
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:25,440
feeling at home

2332
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,900
and so this post post-modern geographers

2333
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:29,880
they try to understand segregation from

2334
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:32,159
this lens and so they try to understand

2335
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:36,960
what moving to the suburbs means or

2336
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,820
these middle class people who did that

2337
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:40,260
in this

2338
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:42,239
was the thing to do if you had the money

2339
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,820
you're reading the quote well let me

2340
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:47,760
move to the suburbs and so this idea of

2341
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,440
social Mobility

2342
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:53,760
and showing off somehow was quite

2343
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,219
important in understanding why this

2344
01:56:56,219 --> 01:56:59,520
group of people moved to the suburbs and

2345
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,159
we can do the same for

2346
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:03,360
um

2347
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:07,139
for for why these gentrifiers

2348
01:57:07,139 --> 01:57:09,659
to move back is often set into the

2349
01:57:09,659 --> 01:57:12,860
cities it will also be about a certain

2350
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:15,860
identity and

2351
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:20,040
about how that gives meaning to to their

2352
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,340
ideas and how they understand themselves

2353
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:25,920
in comparison with others who then

2354
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:29,360
living foreign

2355
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:48,420
on these pictures

2356
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:50,880
and to get them to live in the city

2357
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:53,520
because it helps them

2358
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,980
um to to have a tech space

2359
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:58,739
yeah so if you want to have money to

2360
01:57:58,739 --> 01:58:00,900
spend in a city you will need in the

2361
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:05,520
building system you will eat and

2362
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:10,739
in the City

2363
01:58:10,739 --> 01:58:14,300
now the city council can

2364
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:17,520
I I I'm not really making myself very

2365
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,320
clear but the bottom line is that it's

2366
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:20,820
postmodern geographers decided to

2367
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:23,460
understand why people end up in

2368
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:25,440
different parts of the city through the

2369
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:29,639
lens of identity and how we identify as

2370
01:58:29,639 --> 01:58:31,980
people with the place where we live and

2371
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,840
what that means for how we look at

2372
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,719
ourselves and others looking in other

2373
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:40,699
parts of the city foreign

2374
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,659
[Music]

2375
01:59:12,659 --> 01:59:15,119
so I could give you another exam

2376
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:17,699
question like look at this map here the

2377
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:19,920
distribution of people of Turkish and

2378
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,500
Moroccan origin and answer how would

2379
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:25,500
these different geographers explain it

2380
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,480
and many of the explanations that you've

2381
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:30,599
given in the beginning of

2382
01:59:30,599 --> 01:59:32,760
when I started to talk about the course

2383
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:35,340
of segregation have been studied by

2384
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:36,719
these different

2385
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:38,820
a geographers working in some

2386
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:41,159
disciplines or people in different parts

2387
01:59:41,159 --> 01:59:44,639
of what extent called Urban studies

2388
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:48,420
yeah of course why do we do that is

2389
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:51,179
because we assume that this matters and

2390
01:59:51,179 --> 01:59:53,580
that segregation has effects and has

2391
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:54,840
consequences

2392
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:58,820
that many that people have been

2393
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:01,560
eager to understand what does it mean

2394
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:03,780
for a poor person to live in a

2395
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,820
neighborhood that is smart Bible I mean

2396
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:08,219
most of the other poor people living

2397
02:00:08,219 --> 02:00:10,199
around it does it matter whether you

2398
02:00:10,199 --> 02:00:11,639
live in that kind of neighborhoods or

2399
02:00:11,639 --> 02:00:13,500
whether you as a person you've been a

2400
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:17,960
more mixtape and yet Miller classes

2401
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:20,760
yeah or does it matter for a city

2402
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:23,699
and when you have this segregation of

2403
02:00:23,699 --> 02:00:25,980
blacks living in a particular part of

2404
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:27,719
the city and then why it's taking a

2405
02:00:27,719 --> 02:00:29,040
different Gap

2406
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,320
or would it be better to strive for this

2407
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:34,619
kind of more even distribution of uh of

2408
02:00:34,619 --> 02:00:36,719
blacks and whites in a particular City

2409
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:41,699
or rich and poor or uh young people and

2410
02:00:41,699 --> 02:00:46,639
old people whatever social categories

2411
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:49,080
so next week

2412
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,000
I will not discuss patterns of

2413
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,060
segregation causes of segregation but I

2414
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:57,119
will discuss these effects

2415
02:00:57,119 --> 02:01:00,239
and also policies of social mixing that

2416
02:01:00,239 --> 02:01:03,000
are related so then we get to the heart

2417
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,960
of why does it matter to to study this

2418
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,960
um well is because we assume that

2419
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,719
segregation of concentration

2420
