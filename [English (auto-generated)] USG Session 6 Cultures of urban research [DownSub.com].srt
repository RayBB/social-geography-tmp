thank you

5
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,380

welcome everyone

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,620
good evening this certainly is my

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,360
favorite time of the day to teach teach

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,360
a course at 5 PM after every start at 8

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,460
A.M so anyways uh welcome to Urban

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,500
social geography or urban geography

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,660
depending on your exact type of

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,600
enrollment I am boss van Hur for those

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,940
who don't know me yet and I'll be your

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,500
let's say your lecturer for today's

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,559
session and next week's session

17
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,960
um for some reason because I was I had

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,700
started a web stream on panopto but for

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,380
some reason I was I'm receiving emails

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,320
from Individual students asking for

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,299
permission to gain access to the panopto

22
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,360
webstream I gave everyone

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,920
access access until a minute ago now

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,140
I'll stop so because I have to teach at

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,340
some point

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,780
um so if you receive let's say messages

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,400
from your fellow students who cannot

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,960
attend the reason is that they arrived

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,720
after five past five and I need to get

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,700
started but if all goes well the

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,560
recording will be recorded and uploaded

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,299
it went wrong in the previous lecture

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,799
today because I've been up to technical

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,740
difficulties but hopefully we'll manage

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,619
to day I might close the window at some

36
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,500
point but it might help to get some

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,780
oxygen in here so feel free to also open

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,680
windows at the end if you prefer

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,380
um welcome so two sessions

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,600
um as with some other course we run

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,759
especially the big introductory Master

42
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,979
Level courses

43
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,600
um Urban social geography urban

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,939
geography is a thematic course so it

45
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,140
tries to give you an insight into

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,660
different let's say teams around let's

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,280
say concerning let's say different takes

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,099
on Urban Geography I would personally

49
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,319
prefer to call this course Urban Theory

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,300
yeah because I think we do more than

51
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,819
just geography but the basic idea is to

52
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,560
give different conceptual analytical

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,260
perspectives on how to how to study or

54
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,000
how we can study Europe

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,920
my role

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,500
in this in this course and I guess also

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,080
in my own research specialty is I'm the

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
cultural guy so I I tend to focus on

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,459
more cultural issues uh so I'll be

60
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,900
talking you through

61
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,660
both today and next week Monday July say

62
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,280
cultural approaches to studying the

63
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,420
urban

64
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,340
um today's session oops here we are

65
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,560
today's session is really you see a

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,599
historical overview

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,819
um in the sense that I want to go

68
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,620
through some discussions which you might

69
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,040
know uh or either let's say in generic

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,340
terms or relatively specifically around

71
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,040
let's see how let's say uh thinking

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,900
about let's say cultural approach

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,340
towards the urban has been informed

74
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,900
let's say historically speaking so I'm

75
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,159
going to go through a number of let's

76
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,800
say historical steps mainly focusing on

77
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,180
let's say the impact that sort of the

78
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,800
thinking about the post-modern Assad

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,019
this seems like old hats seems like old

80
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,819
information it's it's certainly a debate

81
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,040
that is not used with this kind of

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,560
terminology except maybe unless a

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,940
journalistic media but certainly not

84
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,400
academically asking speaks in the last

85
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
10 years I wouldn't say that people's

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,879
modern has been the main Obsession for

87
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,159
for let's say for research but I would

88
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,540
argue that much of what has been

89
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,900
discussed from the 1980s onwards more or

90
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,720
less around the postmodern as already is

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,400
still being let's say dealt with

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,140
although using a different vocabulary

93
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,420
yeah this is what you will often see is

94
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,640
that the terminology terminologies might

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,280
change but if you open adapt in more

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,840
historical lands you will see the summit

97
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,340
even though the terminologies have

98
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,680
changed then let's see the underlying on

99
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,019
uh let's say content or the substance

100
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,540
that's behind terminology as we made the

101
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,519
same over many many years so not

102
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,379
everything is new even though you use a

103
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,599
new terminology so today is a more

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,920
historical session you can see on

105
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,220
historical historic sized approach

106
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,079
next week it's I mean rather generically

107
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,060
called Urban cultures but there I want

108
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,320
to sort of give you a number of

109
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,000
perspectives let's say on or let's say

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,680
what could temporary approaches towards

111
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,500
studying uh the urban from a cultural

112
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,360
perspective

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,520
um I will not give a definition of

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,400
culture I mean I'm not I mean so it does

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,860
that's it's a lost it's a lost task it's

116
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,960
not going to work I'm also not going to

117
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,759
give a definition let's say media

118
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,259
Scholars are not going to give a

119
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,080
definition on what media is still they

120
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,720
do interesting research but please keep

121
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,759
in mind that one of my aims here is also

122
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,580
to if you decide to adopt a cultural

123
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,620
approach please be very clear and

124
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,300
specify and unpacking and

125
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,220
operationalizing your use of terminology

126
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,139
because it can mean so many different

127
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,820
things yeah so you have to be quite

128
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,040
specific and hopefully my lessons will

129
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,080
help with bits to give you let's say an

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
insight into the different layers or

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,040
different let's say let's say lines of

132
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,080
research that exist and that all use the

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,540
terminology around around culture so

134
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,860
that's what I'm going to try let's say

135
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,220
to bring across uh today

136
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,199
so this is basically the structure of

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,600
today's session let's see how far we get

138
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,300
it's always unpredictable with slides

139
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,340
and then mood of the day and questions

140
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,840
of students Etc

141
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,300
but first I want to start with a very

142
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,340
let's see setting the scene focusing on

143
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,080
the cultural turn the humanities and the

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,800
social sciences I assume most of you

145
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,780
will more or less know what the cultural

146
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,000
Authority Humanity social sciences is so

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,620
we'll not discuss this in depth yeah

148
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,180
there are many many books written on

149
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,160
this again it's a debate I think that is

150
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,240
more or less

151
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,460
not finished but it has been let's say

152
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,800
many of the debates we've had when

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,539
discussing the cultural term Humanity

154
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,039
social sciences have now and we've been

155
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,620
internalized in everyday research so in

156
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,539
that sense it has become well

157
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,720
naturalized in in in very literal sense

158
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,400
so that's the first part very much

159
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,500
setting to see second part I want to

160
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,380
talk to you about post-modernism and the

161
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,259
city there I will mainly focus on the

162
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,360
work of Frederick Jameson not because I

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
think that he's the only one who has

164
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,300
written on postmodernism in the city

165
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,759
he's not even an urban scholar per se he

166
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,259
actually comes from literary studies and

167
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,600
philosophy but his work is thinking

168
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,180
about this has been very influential

169
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,259
especially because it has been picked up

170
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,259
by Urban Scholars at a later stage

171
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,300
among which the Los Angeles School of

172
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,880
urbanism which is the third section the

173
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,580
third part of today's lecture because

174
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,020
they really have worked you could say

175
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,699
with this with this idea of the

176
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,680
postmodern and the city and have

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,960
proposed new ways of studying this city

178
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,000
as we will see not everything that you

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,520
have proposed uh was as new as they have

180
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,919
claimed but still that it has been quite

181
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,440
a foundational moment for for the study

182
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,180
of the urban for urban studies at large

183
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,520
to close sorry now not too close then

184
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,340
there's a fourth section which adopts

185
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,440
was it continues partially underwater

186
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,080
School of urbanism did but really sort

187
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,000
of broadens and broadens the debate and

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,240
has perhaps been more influential also

189
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,440
and this is literature that's usually

190
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,960
summarized or with terminologies around

191
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,660
Urban Landscapes or the symbolic economy

192
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,099
yeah these are terms that you see

193
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,319
popping up especially from the mid 90s

194
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,740
90s early 2000s onwards and that is

195
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,199
still very influential in in our

196
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,120
thinking on on the city and culture

197
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,620
today

198
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,960
um very last part I will discuss this

199
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,419
today or I'll pick this up tomorrow uh

200
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,060
it's what I call meeting halfway uh

201
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,039
Urban anthropology cultural studies and

202
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,500
the spatial turn my entry point in

203
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,660
discussing the urban that's in and the

204
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,300
cultural culture is trulicity spatial

205
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,220
and geography as a discipline whatever

206
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,680
discipline it might be but let's say

207
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,960
parallel debates going on and what we've

208
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,380
seen from the May 1980s 1990s onwards is

209
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,139
that let's say some of the concerns that

210
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,599
are geography or economic geography or

211
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,240
Human Geography at large has had really

212
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,819
started influencing other debates at the

213
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,620
same time as human geographies started

214
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,780
engaging more or let's say actively more

215
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,360
assertively with other disciplines there

216
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,740
are many many disciplines that could be

217
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,539
that could be let's say

218
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,759
mentioned here but for me some of the

219
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,440
more influential ones are anthropology

220
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,020
Urban anthropology and cultural studies

221
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,259
yeah so where geography start engaging

222
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,960
more with questions around and let's see

223
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,080
questions traditionally uh discussed in

224
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
anthropology or in cultural studies

225
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,740
cultural studies then topology also

226
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,360
started engaging more with less of the

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,880
spatial concerns of geography so this is

228
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,740
something that I will close to this

229
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,680
lecture it or open next week lecture and

230
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,580
now I'm going to close the window

231
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,880
because

232
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,260
hear the difference

233
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,600
is one reminder I have a habit of

234
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,019
talking fast so if I talk too fast just

235
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,440
raise your hands yeah this is I have the

236
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,779
very strange habit of talking faster in

237
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,279
English than I do in Dutch which would

238
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,019
be my mother tongue

239
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,880
um don't ask me why if you ask me to

240
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,500
speak German I'll still slow down but

241
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,959
that wouldn't help for let's say General

242
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,440
comprehension in this class I think okay

243
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,440
first part cultural turn or cultural

244
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,880
turns

245
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,959
um

246
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
the slides are all uploaded so in that

247
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,740
sense you don't have to sort of type

248
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,019
like crazy just try to focus on the main

249
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,120
uh the main elements and try to go the

250
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,860
flow of the argument and trying to

251
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,120
develop

252
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,740
some of you will notice some of you will

253
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,600
not it really depends a bit I think on

254
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,820
your on your educational background yeah

255
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,200
I would assume that those were the

256
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,820
social sciences especially Humanity

257
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,740
backgrounds will be more familiar with

258
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,480
this debate than those let's say coming

259
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,220
from an engineering background but it

260
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,320
much depends a bit on the specificities

261
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,540
also which countries you have studied

262
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,000
so some take-home messages what is the

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
cultural term the cultural terms it's

264
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,839
part of a wider shift since I would

265
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,320
argue the late 1970s at least since this

266
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
period that it was phrased as such in

267
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,279
research practices in Humanities and

268
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,500
social sciences yeah so there are

269
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,300
various interrelated claims so that's

270
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,279
why I talk about cultural turns in a way

271
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,560
because it's not that easy to identify

272
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,560
one single shift in research practices

273
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,100
one is empirical and that simply argues

274
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,740
well simply argues culture is becoming

275
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,720
increasingly important in advanced

276
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,060
societies Advanced societies being a

277
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,560
code word for Western Europe and North

278
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,600
America basically yeah so

279
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,700
knowledge-based sites Advanced societies

280
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,740
post-industrial societies whatever term

281
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,079
you prefer so this is the first claim

282
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,660
being made as to why there is and or

283
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,120
should be a cultural term yeah culture

284
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,579
is simply becoming more important

285
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,380
um and you've opened the question what

286
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,300
Dan is culture about let's just assume

287
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,480
that it refers to the arts film media

288
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
whatever right so adult should become

289
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,720
more important

290
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,600
this relates to a second's plane which

291
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
is theoretical

292
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,060
we need better theories to grasp better

293
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,839
cultural dimensions of the social yeah

294
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,579
referring usually to symbols effects

295
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,339
meaning making practices yeah

296
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,500
the one that doesn't necessarily relate

297
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,180
to the second principle you could have

298
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,100
no change let's say an empirical

299
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,079
phenomena but simply saying well but you

300
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,760
really understand these old phenomena

301
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,760
better we need theories that capture

302
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,760
this the culturals let's say dimensions

303
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,040
of this phenomena better yeah but

304
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,240
obviously when we talk about the

305
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,740
cultural turn often this comes together

306
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,140
we say Okay culture is becoming more

307
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,360
important empirically and in order to

308
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,860
really understand this better we also

309
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,240
need other theories because the theories

310
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
we have don't really capture this quite

311
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,420
well you know so that's the tech

312
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,480
influence the third Point again of

313
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,579
course related with methodological

314
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,740
if this is the case or also respective

315
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,959
of this we need new methods to better

316
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,839
interpret different empirical data and

317
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,079
or to interpret data differently yeah so

318
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,120
either the old data in a different way

319
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,160
or to interpret it better or to

320
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,200
interpret data differently so it's a

321
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
time to interpret new data uh that we

322
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,740
need different methods for this yeah

323
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,839
maybe the simplest example in the

324
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,760
current setting would be if you look at

325
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,920
the rise of social media and let's say

326
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,380
data data skills for example and let's

327
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,480
say the last 10 years it's obviously a

328
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,220
new methods have also Arisen in order to

329
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,200
be able to investigate these phenomena

330
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
so there's a Classics as a

331
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,440
straightforward example of how a new

332
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,920
phenomena has emerged as a society-wide

333
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,220
and we're not always able to capture it

334
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,839
with the same methods that we had before

335
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,519
so you might need different skills

336
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,920
different methods yeah I mean again

337
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,899
question mark not saying this is the

338
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,399
case but this is let's say the argument

339
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,320
is put forward because obviously with

340
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,880
let's see existing methods you can still

341
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,760
do quite quite a lot or maybe they're

342
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,639
tweaking them so that's um important key

343
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,440
in mind so that's the clay but it also

344
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,399
means you have to be let's say

345
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,860
self-reflex appear because a lot of this

346
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,079
involves let's see claims about the

347
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,480
cultural turn does things better yeah

348
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,980
but then of course you always have to

349
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,540
ask yourself okay but better compared to

350
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,339
what right there's often a kind of

351
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,320
simplification of disciplinary histories

352
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,820
because that we say let's say within

353
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,880
urban geography it's a Well we need to

354
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
cultural turn because we need more

355
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,660
qualitative matters before all these old

356
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,880
guys just did quantitative methods yeah

357
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,860
it's just the data crunching this is not

358
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,720
what we need we need to do new matters

359
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,519
and there's like yeah if you look

360
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,500
superficially at that history that might

361
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,600
be the case but if you look more closely

362
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,980
you will see all kinds of different

363
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,019
strands in let's say the 100 or more

364
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,839
than 100 Years of urban studies research

365
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,180
that actually come very close to some of

366
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,639
the claims here made here yeah so that's

367
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,139
the ethnographic research for example

368
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,540
took place before but it's the same so

369
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,459
it really leads to a simplification of

370
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,380
often that's a disciplinary histories

371
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,139
and you need to be quite quite careful

372
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,940
the same arguments around let's say the

373
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,320
industrial and the post-industrial the

374
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,880
post-industrial is not completely new no

375
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,860
but it tends to actually foreground

376
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,500
different trends that might have existed

377
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,019
at a previous phase also but in a last

378
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,940
not in a sense of dominance so this is

379
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,899
important to keep in mind

380
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,579
yes

381
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,959
I don't hear anything sorry

382
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,380
what's your question

383
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,139
I'm afraid because I don't see it

384
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,399
I can have a go on this one but

385
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,360
only I don't have the problem with not

386
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,279
speaking loud enough but I'll see let me

387
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,420
see

388
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,579
yeah the building is awful is

389
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,440
building works also yeah

390
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,120
see I don't hear anything what you're

391
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,920
saying

392
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,920
check

393
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,380
if you're going to dream this morning

394
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,940
last year has all worked quite well but

395
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,320
everything slowly everything is falling

396
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,339
apart give it one year

397
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,959
because there's also not much I can

398
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,620
actually do here

399
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,940
it's all on that but you won't hear me

400
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,779
will you

401
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,779
yeah

402
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,680
and it's awesome I'm afraid this is not

403
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,860
working

404
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,360
thank you

405
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,199
no sorry I could do about it all right

406
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,959
I'll try to speak a bit louder and a bit

407
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,579
slower but there's nothing I can do

408
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,079
about the building usually buildings are

409
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,820
installing five yeah I mean what the

410
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,959
hell anyways

411
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,480
um

412
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,540
so these are some of the main shifts

413
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,040
that you should understand as being part

414
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,839
of let's say the cultural term the

415
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,480
cultural Turks yes just to give you some

416
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,420
quick examples of let's say uh offers

417
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,760
the foundational books that that might

418
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,220
act as a reference reference of let's

419
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,500
say exemplifying the cultural turn

420
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,339
this is getting better yeah so

421
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,320
exemplifying the cultural turn

422
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,660
yes

423
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,800
I'm wondering how people look on this at

424
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,060
panopto they don't understand anything

425
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,820
of this so anyways

426
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,660
um

427
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,519
Frederick Jameson coming from literary

428
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,320
cultural Theory who I will discuss in

429
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,420
some detail precisely because some of

430
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,699
his elements uh some of his arguments

431
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,440
are let's say really foundational thing

432
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,079
for much of urban studies in this

433
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,360
particular strand of research but you

434
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,860
see it also political science and

435
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,380
historical sociology stage formation

436
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,779
after the cultural turn uh really

437
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:44,100
looking at you could say meaning making

438
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,740
practices State imaginary some terms

439
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,079
that maybe now have become quiet

440
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,380
let's see natural really uh to to think

441
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,899
about what the state is but perhaps from

442
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,060
let's say an earlier institutional point

443
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,220
of view we're not so much the case yeah

444
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,420
so

445
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,160
and as you see many of these claims were

446
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
made or cultural and economy after the

447
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,140
cultural turn yeah

448
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,319
foreign

449
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,939
but it really doesn't help for the

450
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,079
Acoustics right

451
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,419
so looking at organizations much more

452
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,339
from a cultural perspective that is not

453
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,260
just about the organization and let's

454
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,299
say a functional manner but also about

455
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,059
again meeting making practices ways of

456
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:28,679
Behaving uh within organizations

457
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,140
um anthropology and history history

458
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,540
sociology Etc you could name many many

459
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,520
of these books but they all at that

460
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,620
point in time and it was all around late

461
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,500
1980s throughout the 1990s that these

462
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,000
kinds of claims were made most

463
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,260
forcefully in in academic literature

464
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,320
now to Frederick Jameson every year wait

465
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,000
it sounds a bit harsh but every year I

466
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,559
have to check online if he's not that

467
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,280
yet because he was born in 1934-4 but I

468
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,960
don't think he's that active anymore but

469
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,340
he would think he was pretty active

470
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,960
until five to ten years ago which in

471
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,539
itself uh is quite achievement he has

472
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,160
published an enormous amount of books

473
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,179
and articles

474
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,360
uh is a professor or Emeritus professor

475
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,340
of comparative literature at Duke

476
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,400
University and has become I'll put I

477
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,559
just put some passwords here has become

478
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,240
very famous for Marxist literary

479
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,640
cultural theory for debates obviously on

480
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,820
around modernity and post-modernity and

481
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,320
also for the relation to culture and

482
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,500
political economy so if these buzzwords

483
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,640
should already give a bit of an

484
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,860
explanation let's ask them how he

485
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,539
interprets culture because he has a

486
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,640
strong you see Marxist but in a very

487
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,620
let's see open manner but especially

488
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,539
this is important so he always looks at

489
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,100
the relation of culture to political

490
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,260
economy which is basically a code word

491
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,360
for capitalism yeah so this is I would

492
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,480
say I would say his main concern in his

493
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,820
writings at least on on culture and

494
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,600
postmodernism

495
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,520
now there's a phrase that has become

496
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,020
well this is also his article originally

497
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,740
published in 1984.

498
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,760
which he died which he titled

499
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,160
post-modernism as the cultural logic of

500
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,620
late capitalism yeah so this is really

501
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,179
let's say a phrase that has become very

502
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,480
famous also you see it referred to

503
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,299
um on a regular basis now there are a

504
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,740
number of elements I don't know who has

505
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,240
wrapped to the article I'm not going to

506
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,740
ask I'm not even going to ask who has

507
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,120
actually managed to finish the article

508
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,100
because it's not a simple article I am

509
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,320
very well aware of this

510
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,480
um it is worth it I mean have a drink

511
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,059
sit down late evening and you'll maybe

512
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,400
understand it better uh

513
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,080
who knows

514
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,080
um but it really is uh I'm I'm trying to

515
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,220
give you also let's say some

516
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,840
foundational original literatures not

517
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
just about secondary literature artists

518
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,740
writing about other artists but this is

519
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,500
the is a is an article related to book

520
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,780
that is let's say it's referenced all

521
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,580
the time so it really helps to go back

522
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,799
to the original uh to get a sense of

523
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,500
what is arguing now I picked to do your

524
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,900
homework I picked some as a key quotes

525
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,299
from from this article which in a way

526
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,220
give a good summary of what this claim

527
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,960
is about and which shaped I think some

528
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,140
of the urban research later on

529
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,299
first he says of course modernism is not

530
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,120
a style but it acts or it is a cultural

531
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,799
dominant yeah

532
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,080
so it's not just a lifestyle question no

533
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,460
it's actually something that has become

534
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,220
dominant in our contemporary culture

535
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,419
second

536
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,039
and directly related aesthetic

537
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
production today and this is of course

538
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,640
where let's see it's Marxist on as the

539
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,340
political economy sympathies show a

540
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,200
static production today has become

541
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,140
integrated into commodity production uh

542
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,780
generally yeah so it's really difficult

543
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,660
he argues to distinguish aesthetic

544
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,059
production and production of the Arts

545
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,520
symbolic entities from Commodities yeah

546
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,620
so it basically becomes one two sides of

547
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,000
the same coin that's basically what

548
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,340
she's arguing yeah I think if you start

549
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,039
thinking empirically it's quite easy to

550
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,299
come up with concrete example of

551
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,679
anything oh yeah that makes a lot of

552
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,080
sense yeah a work of art let's see a

553
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,020
painting is at the same time let's say

554
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,559
aesthetic production yeah it's about

555
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,640
symbolic and meaning making practices

556
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,100
yes about interpretation but it's also

557
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,900
sells on the Art Market yeah and it's

558
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,059
not to do with speculation so it's both

559
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,440
you know

560
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,539
that historic elements

561
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,220
I'll skip this because it's interesting

562
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,559
but there's a very let's say 1980

563
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,840
sentiment where sort of globalization

564
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,580
and Americanization was very much seen

565
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,720
as one of the same thing or

566
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,520
globalization was seen as you could see

567
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,940
an extension uh of an earlier history of

568
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,919
Americanization yeah

569
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,600
and then he talks about it this again

570
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,919
becomes very important I said well

571
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,440
basically he looks at postmodernism as

572
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,620
the third stage of capital capitalism uh

573
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,080
referring to Alice Mandel was a market

574
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,000
scholar actually at this University many

575
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,740
many years ago

576
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,960
um which would then be a uses different

577
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,000
terminologies for it he refers to

578
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,159
post-industrial capitalism because the

579
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,780
base capitalism to multinational

580
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,820
capitalism or to Consumer capitalism

581
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,480
yeah so you could argue this all here is

582
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,480
the politically political economy policy

583
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,260
political economy side of postmodernism

584
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,200
yeah so post-modernism accompanies this

585
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,960
phase of capitalism yeah that also means

586
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,140
according to to Jameson it only makes

587
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,480
sense to talk about postmodernism from

588
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
let's say the mid 1970s onwards there is

589
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,700
no such thing in this way of reasoning

590
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,460
as post-modernism in the 1920s just

591
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,080
doesn't make any sense yeah because it's

592
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,419
so much tied to a particular face or

593
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,799
particular stage of capitalism

594
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,919
one reason why this article has become

595
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,120
quite famous and it's a bit more

596
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,799
difficult to understand now I think is

597
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,080
because he does quite an extensive re uh

598
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,240
reading and interpretation of one

599
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,500
particular hotel which is the

600
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,600
bonaventura hotel

601
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,700
um in Los Angeles

602
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,340
so uh designed by John Portman built in

603
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,860
the mid-1970s and one of the largest

604
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,559
hotels in La and to my knowledge uh it's

605
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,900
it still is

606
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,520
so just some pictures

607
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,919
this this hotel for him it's a bit hard

608
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,280
to imagine now but it's if you look

609
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,419
represents you could say the culmination

610
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,960
of post-modernism as the late logic as

611
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,940
the elastic logic of of late capitalism

612
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,320
so what does he argue here you will see

613
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,000
that some of these elephants return in

614
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,799
later debates without reference to the

615
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,900
hotel or the specificity of his his

616
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,600
argument it aspires to be a total space

617
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,299
a complete world and an attempt to not

618
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,520
be a part of the city yeah so it tends

619
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,580
to be a world on its own yeah

620
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,039
to not be a part of the sea so it has a

621
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,320
reflective glass skin which repels the

622
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,340
city

623
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,799
outside and achieves The Peculiar and

624
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,080
placeless dissociation of the

625
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,140
bonaventura from its neighborhood yeah

626
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,760
just keep this in mind somebody's else

627
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,620
because they will return later yeah but

628
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,360
it is separate from the city so it's

629
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,700
quite a quite easy to imagine later and

630
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,559
I'll give some examples also if you

631
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,360
think of let's say gated community style

632
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,919
things right things that are let's say

633
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,080
within the city but cities are highly

634
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,880
unequal so you have different elements

635
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,919
let's say separate even though they're

636
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,900
formally speaking part of the sea this

637
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,340
is what he's arguing at that this is

638
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,679
what we see in the Bonaventure Hotel and

639
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,600
then this becomes a bit more difficult

640
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,460
to imagine now because it really is I

641
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,860
think an experience of that time I think

642
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,539
we're now so used to these kinds of

643
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:28,799
architectures and these kinds of

644
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,080
buildings but here according to him this

645
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,179
becomes impossible to navigate they have

646
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,539
postmodern hyperspace I'll skip that is

647
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,460
impossible to navigate yeah it's just

648
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,380
too confusing in any way you can no

649
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,080
longer situate yourself as a subject

650
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,419
within this world but you're just very a

651
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,700
very fragmented human being that was a

652
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,620
kind of let's say a typical let's say

653
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,940
literary Trope of 1980s post-modernism I

654
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,700
think this has probably become us

655
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,740
Central to the debate most likely

656
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,539
because we have so we have become so

657
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:05,120
used to behaving like this in the world

658
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,020
again I want to discuss these in detail

659
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,059
I'll skip the first this one might be

660
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,679
important to remember here because again

661
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,780
this shows up and later discussions

662
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,860
especially when we think about

663
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,419
discussions around cultural heritage

664
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,240
yeah his stories isn't a thesis history

665
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,580
a random cannibalization of all the

666
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,919
styles of the past and this idea that

667
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,799
especially post-modern architecture just

668
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,240
use different elements for different

669
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,419
eras and combined us into a new building

670
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,400
yeah so it didn't produce let's say

671
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,740
formally speaking something new but it

672
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,140
was more of Rico large a combination of

673
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,059
all kinds of existing let's say

674
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,279
architectural Styles yeah so a random

675
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,900
categorization of the cells of the past

676
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,120
the past as a reference finds itself

677
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,980
gradually bracketed leaving us nothing

678
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,279
with nothing but text yeah

679
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,200
so this is also again something that

680
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
pops up in later discussions uh on okay

681
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,299
what what do let's say

682
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,260
um

683
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,880
what what does let's say culture

684
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,260
actually produce and there's this idea

685
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,880
that the postmodern that it well we've

686
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,039
actually reached a post-modern phase but

687
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,900
there's no linear trajectory if there

688
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,299
ever was let's say between history and

689
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,400
future it's just a recycling of the past

690
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,000
yeah

691
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,640
okay

692
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,279
now that's Jameson

693
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,919
does that make a bit more sense than

694
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,200
when you read the text

695
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,000
yeah

696
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,620
okay

697
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,299
um

698
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,460
now I mentioned Jameson

699
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,620
um not because I like my old almost dead

700
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,320
white man but um but because he really

701
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,059
has been inspirational I think for many

702
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,620
let's say researchers that came after

703
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,480
from different different perspectives

704
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,000
also yeah the Los Angeles School of

705
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,360
urbanism is one of La cities

706
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,700
um let's see cluster or a cluster of

707
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,380
activity that came together from the mid

708
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,659
1980s onwards and we should also refer

709
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,580
to James in order to build on it in a

710
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,140
more you could say social scientific

711
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,279
Urban research type type of manner

712
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,600
what does the Los Angeles School of

713
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,760
urbanism argue and I'll deconstruct this

714
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,500
idea that it is a career in school but

715
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,380
that is sad to argue

716
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,299
first of all following Jameson literally

717
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,039
following Jameson it looks at the

718
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,039
post-modern condition as a radically new

719
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,380
Urban condition yeah so this is what

720
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,740
they call post-modern urbanism yeah main

721
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,020
characteristics and again be aware of

722
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,340
let's say the simplification of

723
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,799
disciplinary histories because it does

724
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,720
it does have especially in this let's

725
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,500
say

726
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,600
foundational text or a text that try to

727
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,419
let's say really put let's say the LA

728
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,400
School of urbanism on the map through a

729
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,980
number of key Publications it did have a

730
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,240
tendency to then say okay but everything

731
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,940
that came before in a way it was

732
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,919
it's old hat we don't want that we need

733
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,980
something new so yeah very very strong

734
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,740
sense of simplification for some of the

735
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,020
main characteristics self self-defined

736
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,860
Beyond Chicago school what we see now is

737
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,260
not you could say eccentric City but no

738
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,620
it's about Urban fragmentation yeah

739
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,600
it understands LA and Southern

740
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,480
California as privileged cases so the

741
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,580
priority case for doing research but

742
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,740
also as a prototypical case in the sense

743
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,659
that they understood LA and Southern

744
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,600
California as the future of other cities

745
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,940
across the world yeah look at what we

746
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,340
see happening in LA and this region this

747
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,600
is what we will see happening in cities

748
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,640
across the world yeah so it's kind of

749
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,100
three figures let's see future Urban

750
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,220
developments yeah

751
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,480
it paid a lot of attention to

752
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,340
restructuring which was like say the

753
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,559
generic word focusing mostly on

754
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,900
post-forwardism flexible accumulation

755
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,360
the the Redevelopment of firms so I

756
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,679
won't go into this because I think

757
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,960
you're all aware by now of let's say

758
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,799
let's say uh yeah post fordism basically

759
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,779
yeah

760
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,400
um and there's a nice quote from Mike

761
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,360
Davis a writer analytical writer

762
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,700
uh belonging more or less to the same

763
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,100
scene in a way where we talked about the

764
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,480
LA School of urbanless saying well

765
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,980
they're basically politically economists

766
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,020
with their spacesuits on not quite sure

767
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,059
to fully understand what he means it but

768
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,799
it looks really it sounds really nice as

769
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,179
a as a quote

770
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,039
so it gives you a sense it's politically

771
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,659
economy but it's a bit off it's

772
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,100
something else right it's a bit

773
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,820
speculative

774
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,220
foreign

775
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,840
it's important again to be aware of

776
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,700
simplification of disciplinary histories

777
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,279
and it also applies to the LA school as

778
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,640
such yeah so it was all it was soon seen

779
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,220
as a coherent school but it was also

780
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,320
soon critiqued by others and even by

781
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,240
those within working within this domain

782
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,220
or that was let's say label as being

783
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,260
part of the LA School of urbanism saying

784
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,299
well actually there's not one single

785
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,520
claim being made by the LA School of

786
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,200
urbanism but actually there's more

787
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,320
diversity within this supposed school so

788
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,559
there is a diversity within coherence

789
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,360
perhaps so I would argue there are a

790
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,179
number of different lines of research

791
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,919
which in itself have older histories

792
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,020
longer histories but it really came

793
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,120
together at this point in time and I

794
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,940
think it still shapes to some extent uh

795
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,679
to quite a substantial extent here

796
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,659
current research that we are doing today

797
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,600
yeah so one important traps which has

798
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,480
become even the most

799
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,919
famous one is more

800
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,200
political economy economic geography I

801
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,779
guess really looks at postpartism

802
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,399
flexible accumulation industrial

803
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,620
organization Regional development so

804
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,080
really about the transformation of firms

805
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,820
how firms relate to each other how they

806
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,980
connect yeah and what this means for

807
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,260
regional development yeah

808
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,880
let's see the key artist there to

809
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,620
mention of perhaps Alan Scott Susan

810
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,539
Christopherson Michael stalker most of

811
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,700
you will have heard of these names at

812
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,140
least yeah

813
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,820
however there are also other lines of

814
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,740
work one thing I mean this problem is to

815
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,020
some extent most related to First a

816
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,419
political economy of place because if

817
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,620
you look at let's say Regional

818
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,120
development the transformation of

819
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,039
companies there's also an element there

820
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,840
okay what does this mean actually for

821
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,419
let's say local place conditions it has

822
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,220
to do with Place identity but it also

823
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,020
has to do with branding elements it has

824
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,960
to do with let's say local patriotism or

825
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
it has to do with local labor markets

826
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,960
Etc yeah

827
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,240
this that leads to distance strength I

828
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,440
mean they're all related obviously

829
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,539
someone like Jennifer wolf having worked

830
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,520
on homelessness unskilled work local

831
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,100
labor markets a classic argument in this

832
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,500
literature is that the transformation of

833
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,659
of the region as a result of let's say

834
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:43,919
the transformation of its political

835
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,440
economy leads to more polarized labor

836
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,399
markets so we have let's say simplified

837
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:52,320
put in a simplified sense we have let's

838
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,360
see high earners and we have let's say a

839
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,700
very let's see if if not unskilled and

840
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,100
then it gets very low paid and

841
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,200
precariously employed workers on the

842
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,000
bottom so it leads to a more polarized

843
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,340
labor market there's also you think that

844
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,899
has been picked up later by someone like

845
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:09,179
Sasuke assassin working on global cities

846
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,240
yeah so that's important and this wraps

847
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,880
less I mean less famous but but let's

848
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,220
emerge now I think more Force for the

849
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,840
last 10 years is work around

850
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,640
environmental justice yeah the

851
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,140
transformation of the region has also

852
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,659
had effects on the environment at large

853
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:27,480
the planning issues but also uh ecology

854
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,299
issues more narrowly put and this has

855
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,860
already received some attention there

856
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,279
yes

857
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,720
I'll give I'll give some examples I

858
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,700
think later on but basically it's about

859
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,500
Urban fragmentation if I would have to

860
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,760
put it in a bus word so this idea that I

861
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,899
mean especially me for those that

862
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,460
attended my lecture on the European sea

863
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,020
there's this idea that it's a compact

864
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,640
City it's a coherent city is

865
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,159
historically grown and amazing world of

866
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,000
actually

867
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,440
it's a post-modern city it's almost

868
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,600
inverse right it just it's like a

869
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,980
chessboard where whatever you could put

870
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,480
about rationality not a good example

871
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,919
because you know it's a very clear rules

872
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,380
there but when you just like a game

873
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,700
board where you could put wherever you

874
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,260
want and this is how then the city

875
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,840
develops yeah so and this is what and so

876
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,880
this relates to Urban fragmentation and

877
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,919
the other one sprawled I would say say

878
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,899
those would be two issues where they

879
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,299
argue okay this is actually

880
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:34,799
foreshadowing why the urban developments

881
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,480
and they're not completely wrong of

882
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,279
course I would simply I would just argue

883
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,860
that maybe La was not the first and in

884
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,600
parallel at least we saw we see many

885
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,399
other cities where this was also the

886
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,760
case especially uh in the global South

887
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,919
um but this is I mean that's only a

888
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,080
critique that has been raised towards

889
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,480
the LA school also because it's only

890
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,820
only at a later stage I think that it

891
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,620
started looking outside of North America

892
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,860
it was a strong American bias maybe

893
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,960
Western Europe and only later that it

894
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,220
started expanding and then of course

895
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,559
somebody's theories no longer hold or

896
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:11,699
somebody claims in any case yeah yeah

897
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,118
okay

898
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,440
so there's a lot of diversity if you

899
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,239
look at it at the same time it must be

900
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,219
said

901
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:22,020
cumulatively between the mid 1980s and

902
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,659
the mid and the late 1990s various key

903
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,879
Publications were published that put La

904
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,099
really on the map of urban studies yeah

905
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,960
so and this really really helps I think

906
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,679
to to retrospectively look at this as a

907
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,659
kind of coherent La School of urbanism

908
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,599
yeah that's ranging from a 1986 special

909
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,000
issue in society of space which is one

910
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,859
of the few journals specifically

911
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:46,320
dedicated to LA to books like the city

912
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,839
Los Angeles and urban theory in the mid

913
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,440
1990s or rethinking LA

914
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,359
or Studies by Alan J Scott on

915
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,339
technopolis there are many many of these

916
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,020
key books that really appear to the key

917
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,240
references in the field of urban studies

918
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,760
that are still let's say dealt with or

919
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,400
referred to uh today yeah

920
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,280
well for example Mike Mike Davis as I

921
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,920
said what an academic person but his

922
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,200
famous book city of quartz which again

923
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,020
is continuously referenced in many

924
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,720
different uh parts of the urban studies

925
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,339
world and uh and Beyond

926
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,160
this one is perhaps already a partial

927
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,599
answer to your question because this

928
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,200
shows a bit in extreme I would say how

929
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,140
some of these artists looked at at city

930
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,660
development I mean I'm saying in extreme

931
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,980
because this is really an article that

932
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,839
tries to codify some of the claims that

933
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,700
were made in a more subtle manner than

934
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,280
many other orders

935
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,300
um

936
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,280
and by doing said he also radicalized

937
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,020
some of these claims not necessarily in

938
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,380
a in a helpful manner I think but it

939
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,000
helps to keep in mind

940
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,680
so they said they argue that the spatial

941
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,440
manifestation so uh the honest dear and

942
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,240
flusty so I forgot their names

943
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,560
they argue that the spatial

944
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,200
manifestation of post-modern urbanism

945
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,560
was a kind of key no capitalism Yeah so

946
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,359
basically it's apparently a board game I

947
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,160
wasn't aware of that but basically a

948
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,020
very fragmented form of an urban

949
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,260
structure in which the quote

950
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,520
urbanization is occurring on a

951
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,099
quasi-random field of opportunities Yeah

952
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,440
so basically there's no longer this idea

953
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,720
that you have a city center and then it

954
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,460
emerges outwards or there are particular

955
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,280
structures related to planning Etc no it

956
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,920
just it's pretty random yeah

957
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,140
and this is also all of course also the

958
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,760
end of theory because if you make this

959
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,260
kind of claim that does not really much

960
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,140
you can you can do anymore so it's also

961
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,240
highly let's say simplified so I would

962
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,339
certainly not encourage you to

963
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:45,960
understand this as the core business of

964
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,579
the LA School of urbanism this is almost

965
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:51,060
more a parody of the of this debate

966
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,119
nevertheless some of the lesser the

967
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,740
items literally speaking they put on the

968
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,140
map of Keto capitalism

969
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,900
still resonate with us today because for

970
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,540
example we have here at no verb which

971
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,040
you could say there's a lot of which is

972
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,480
still going on on let's say ethnic

973
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,980
communities the relation between ethnic

974
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,900
groups and let's say localities within

975
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,480
cities neighborhoods we have Team marks

976
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,119
parks sorry it's a lot of

977
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,099
commodification of public space we have

978
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,960
created communities with obviously plays

979
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,579
well we have Street Warfare So that

980
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,079
obviously there's violence in the city

981
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,700
which is a classic team in urban

982
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,400
research spectacle again which relates

983
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,220
to let's be commodification of space

984
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,540
command and Patrol centers which is

985
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,400
let's say the classic team Awards like

986
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,260
Sasuke assassin this idea that Global

987
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,359
cities are with where the action happens

988
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,280
when it comes to post-political and

989
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,200
economic rule so all these different

990
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,420
elements do

991
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,180
uh well we're identified by them and

992
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,920
have played an important role in later

993
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,540
research on this city

994
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,700
yeah I give some examples already here I

995
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,800
don't need to go through this again

996
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,619
so much my summary uh of the LA School

997
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,720
of earliest I already hint that the fact

998
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,980
that

999
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,200
this was not without its critique and

1000
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,220
some of this critique was quite

1001
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,200
legitimate because one of let's say my

1002
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,540
hobby was is to really warn against the

1003
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,339
simplification of disciplinary histories

1004
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,500
there's a lot of academic laziness

1005
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,660
involved you want to make a claim that

1006
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,800
you do something relevant and

1007
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,660
interesting and by doing that you say

1008
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,640
about that what came before was actually

1009
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,020
not that interesting but you actually

1010
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,260
simplify that history yeah so if you're

1011
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,180
intellectually I think very honest you

1012
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,859
have to be very careful with these kinds

1013
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,060
of strategies you have to be much more

1014
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,859
or less honest and open and respectful

1015
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,079
also of what came before and maybe

1016
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,880
moderate your own claims to towards new

1017
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,920
illness this is not what the LA school

1018
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,480
did or let's say let's see some artists

1019
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,920
within this field

1020
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,400
so critics were also abundant and all

1021
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,339
very early on raised let's say made

1022
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:56,460
let's say problems had the issues they

1023
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,040
had with let's say the claims of noon is

1024
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,560
put forward by other school Earnest one

1025
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,740
being what's really new here yeah

1026
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,599
you might claim that this is work done

1027
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,160
that hasn't received enough attention

1028
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,079
but actually there's already a lot of

1029
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,599
existing work on diversity restructuring

1030
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,000
consumption and commodification or in

1031
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,800
urban poverty yeah especially Urban

1032
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,400
poverty has been foundational to riding

1033
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,440
on the urban since the mid-19th century

1034
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,820
yeah so there's actually an

1035
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,740
industrialization basically so what's

1036
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,359
really new here

1037
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,720
that's the first legitimate criticism

1038
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,420
second one it is

1039
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,000
the LA school it really sort of reduced

1040
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,560
The Chicago School

1041
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,839
do a kind of Burgess concentric zone

1042
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,300
model the idea that everything that was

1043
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,060
written in the 1930s which is post-hoc

1044
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,240
sometimes labeled as The Chicago School

1045
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,220
was about the concentric zone model this

1046
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,619
idea that as a central central air

1047
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,060
business district and had people move

1048
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,339
outwards depending on let's say history

1049
00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:00,119
and and capital also yeah there's much

1050
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,859
more internal of our or there was much

1051
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,720
more internal variety within the Chicago

1052
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,300
school so it does not justify this kind

1053
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,520
of simplification yeah so many things

1054
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,920
the TLA school is now doing actually was

1055
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,480
already happening in The Chicago School

1056
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,240
so let's say the American claim there's

1057
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,680
of course also a struggle you could say

1058
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,280
within us American Academia saying well

1059
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,920
we've had Chicago now we move to LA this

1060
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,660
is where the action is happening and

1061
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,980
then many other Arts were saying well

1062
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,619
maybe not quite yeah so that's important

1063
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:29,760
to keep in mind

1064
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,119
a third one this perhaps for me the

1065
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,920
most the most interesting or the most

1066
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,280
relevant critique is there is truly I

1067
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,859
think a kind of ethnographic void in a

1068
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,119
lot of literature and post-modern

1069
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,980
urbanism what do I mean by this it

1070
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,660
really relies on a kind of deep text

1071
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,240
reading of the city this is the most

1072
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,880
let's see extreme example

1073
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,160
this is how we see the city I mean if

1074
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,720
there is anything more top-down than

1075
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,280
this I mean it's hard to imagine right

1076
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,780
it really is like okay let's hear this

1077
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,240
is how we see the city but it has no way

1078
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,480
at no stage do you see any engagement

1079
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,520
well with what people on the ground

1080
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,320
actually think about the city they live

1081
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,480
in or work in yeah so it's a very sort

1082
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,720
of top-down Matrix oriented reading of

1083
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,480
the city so which is labeled as an

1084
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,280
ethnographic void which I think is the

1085
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,099
most forceful to your team yeah it has a

1086
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:21,780
marginalized agency and interpretation

1087
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,839
of Ordinary People yeah and there's no

1088
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,000
so there's also no post-modernism From

1089
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,920
Below you could you could imagine a kind

1090
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,320
of let's say fragmented urbanism and

1091
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,880
then brick collage a combination of

1092
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,119
elements by people making making do

1093
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,040
making a living in a city and combining

1094
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,720
different elements but none of that is

1095
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,420
part of this discussion okay so it's a

1096
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,760
Much More Much Too dubbed down too too

1097
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,800
detached reading

1098
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,440
last critique and they said it relates a

1099
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,420
bit to this idea that La pre-figures

1100
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,119
wider Urban developments they're saying

1101
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,700
well la is actually not that radically

1102
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,480
different on two levels uh first within

1103
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,540
La existing Urban theories before the LA

1104
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,240
School of urbanism are still relevant to

1105
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,740
explain what happens in la la is not a

1106
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,400
complete free let's say board with

1107
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,020
quasi-random uh let's say activities

1108
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,700
taking place no you can use all the

1109
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,859
theories around let's say agglomeration

1110
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:22,320
for example in order to understand LA or

1111
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,060
in this wider region so that's one thing

1112
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,579
the other side is that the empirical

1113
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:29,820
phenomena we see in LA are also visible

1114
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,820
elsewhere and not just as a prefiguring

1115
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,380
not something that comes after the other

1116
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,500
school urbanists talked about La no but

1117
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,460
actually something that was already

1118
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,320
before maybe some cities were even

1119
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,480
earlier and the other thing is also to

1120
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,300
some extent where especially research is

1121
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,940
working in the global Styles uh really

1122
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,160
connected to right say okay there's much

1123
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,800
happening elsewhere which is perhaps

1124
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,960
more interesting also and certainly

1125
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,940
shows let's say that La is not that

1126
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,260
special after all

1127
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,980
okay

1128
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,119
wow went fast yeah

1129
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,800
get off the screen

1130
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,920
questions

1131
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:48,119
well I mean I would

1132
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,579
I would situate that a bit I would say

1133
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,680
certain strands within geography this

1134
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,319
was at least what what you're saying but

1135
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:56,940
if you look at much of this literature

1136
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,339
especially worked by people like Alexis

1137
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,140
and Christopherson they're all working

1138
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,200
in a kind of realist vein right in the

1139
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,599
sense of it's pretty straightforward

1140
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,400
Empirical research right there's a world

1141
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,319
out there we're going to study it some

1142
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,359
of the examples you mentioned might have

1143
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,099
happened but I would say that was more

1144
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,960
or less a visible or more Central to the

1145
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,119
debate in literary studies it may be

1146
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,160
cultural studies to some extent and less

1147
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,540
so in geography

1148
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,599
so um I don't think it was necessarily A

1149
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,160
in when it came to the LA School of

1150
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,740
urban is the necessary much reflection

1151
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,839
actually on the epistemological the

1152
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:32,940
methodological Dimension and it was more

1153
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,220
an observation of new empirical facts on

1154
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,500
the ground which necessitated new

1155
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,839
theories according to them so I think

1156
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,060
it's more on that level but obviously I

1157
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,619
mean as I said at the very end there is

1158
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,020
no such thing as one cultural turn and

1159
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,520
also no such thing as one force

1160
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,160
modernism so I think that's uh and if

1161
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,500
you look at the way a term such as the

1162
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,920
postmodern has been um let's say discuss

1163
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,540
within different disciplines you see

1164
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,420
quite radical differences between what

1165
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,160
is actually understood by the postmodern

1166
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,260
in the first place and there are

1167
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,760
interesting books written on this also

1168
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,280
but yeah that yeah

1169
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,740
okay other questions on these first

1170
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,440
three was it two more substantial parts

1171
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,339
nope

1172
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,460
um how are we doing time wise yeah let's

1173
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,599
give it a few more minutes and then

1174
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:25,859
we'll see

1175
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:28,440
um am I talking too fast or is it

1176
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,560
okay-ish I think the fact that I have to

1177
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,599
speak very loud automatically slows me

1178
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,579
down right so that helps in a way so I

1179
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:37,560
might just start screaming in my

1180
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,079
lectures and then I'll I'll slow down my

1181
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,240
Tempo yeah

1182
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,420
foreign

1183
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,660
so we've got cultural term we've got

1184
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,859
postmodern let's say jamesonian

1185
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:58,140
approaches a sort of Vision on the

1186
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,579
postmodern

1187
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:02,339
this indirectly or directly influence a

1188
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,619
lot of La school urbanism work yeah I

1189
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,119
think it was not just Jameson but there

1190
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,619
are many many that see similarities

1191
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:10,079
there and there's a related strand which

1192
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,119
now I want to discuss with you which I

1193
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:13,980
would call as the urban Landscapes and

1194
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,680
symbolic economy mostly because this is

1195
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,359
the terminology that was

1196
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,040
that I mean the different strands of

1197
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,480
research but there's a lot of research

1198
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,240
around these this kind of teams which

1199
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,640
supposedly refer to actual facts on the

1200
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,380
ground so don't see it as something

1201
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,599
completely different from let's say the

1202
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,000
other school of urban is more let's say

1203
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,640
developing in parallel perhaps also a

1204
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,020
different inspiration it's coming a bit

1205
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,520
more I would argue from black City

1206
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,020
Cultural studies tradition which also

1207
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,660
emerged in the 1980s yeah but obviously

1208
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,420
their interactions also so just uh to

1209
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,000
know as a clear cut categories here

1210
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,339
if you look at what I now describe as

1211
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:51,960
let's say one body of literature because

1212
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,579
for me it makes sense to describe this

1213
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,260
as a relatively coherent body of

1214
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,359
literature there are a number of key

1215
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,300
guiding assumptions arguments shaping

1216
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,819
this kind of literature one very similar

1217
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,240
to Jameson flexible accumulation

1218
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,560
post-forwardism and post-modernism are

1219
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,599
two sides of the same coin so this is

1220
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,339
your Marx's argument right so there's a

1221
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:13,980
political economy and the culture as you

1222
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,740
can see that let's see the other side of

1223
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,420
this political economy but it's it's

1224
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,540
it's it's impossible to extract it just

1225
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,000
belongs very closely together

1226
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,099
and Innovation perhaps that this

1227
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:28,740
literature introduced is it's according

1228
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,180
to the much of this literature says well

1229
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,599
we see the rise of postmodernism also

1230
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,400
hanging together with the rise of a new

1231
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,920
middle class yeah and this very much

1232
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,260
hangs together again with just a rise of

1233
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,780
post-fortism post-industrialism because

1234
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,760
it Latin new you could say work

1235
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,099
opportunities new fields of work new

1236
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:49,500
labor markets which demand that you

1237
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,819
could say uh a uh a a a type of worker a

1238
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:55,859
type of population that was overall

1239
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,599
Highly Educated that was knowledge

1240
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,400
oriented yeah so this is the kind of

1241
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,440
debate around higher education

1242
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,900
knowledge-based capitalism and this was

1243
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,640
very much seen as it's higher educated

1244
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,560
and this is what they should understood

1245
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,480
to be the rise of a new middle class

1246
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,700
yeah it's not your classic middle class

1247
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,460
which perhaps massive more fixed but and

1248
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,380
this is the introduction that was done

1249
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,119
here say okay this rise of the numeral

1250
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:19,140
class

1251
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,800
is accompanied by a device or an

1252
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,540
interest and new you could say aesthetic

1253
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,240
sensibility sensitivities interests

1254
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,700
preferences yeah this idea that there's

1255
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,460
a new kind of Aesthetics emerging with

1256
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,980
this new group of people yeah which they

1257
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,839
labeled and commodity Aesthetics in a

1258
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,060
way that because was highly driven or

1259
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,800
widely related to let's say lifestyle

1260
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,839
preferences yeah

1261
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:45,300
I'm interested come up with a good

1262
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,940
example I'm interested I work for let's

1263
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,319
say a

1264
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:51,119
not I can't come up with a good example

1265
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,560
I try to come up with a better example

1266
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,579
here

1267
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:55,680
I'll give examples in a minute yes it

1268
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,300
doesn't really matter

1269
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,740
um

1270
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,359
[Music]

1271
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:01,980
no because the kinds of examples I was

1272
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,020
thinking about are mostly around let's

1273
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,640
say Urban Street culture for example

1274
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,380
which is very much related to particular

1275
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,500
let's say the lifestyles that really

1276
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,480
lead to let's say how you identify with

1277
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,680
particular Lifestyles and these

1278
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,300
lifestyles are closely connected to the

1279
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,880
buying and showing of particular

1280
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,780
Commodities yeah shoes clothes

1281
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,740
artworks that you affiliate that you

1282
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,140
associate with if you're a bit higher up

1283
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,339
Etc

1284
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,319
so let's say the second part third one

1285
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,780
is that culture was key or is key to

1286
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,119
Urban Redevelopment this has remained I

1287
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,040
think very influential I'm doing work on

1288
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,839
this still but there's also his work

1289
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:39,240
that was already let's say put forward

1290
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,940
and started being done in the late 1980s

1291
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,980
work being done on real estate on

1292
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,500
artists on on representations of urban

1293
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,599
space yeah if you think now of work

1294
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:51,780
being done on the impact of of

1295
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,660
gentrification yeah on on City spaces

1296
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,880
how artists play a role in both let's

1297
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,339
say boosting gentrification but also

1298
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:01,319
being kicked out of gentrifying areas

1299
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:03,359
That's a classic argument which Harris

1300
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,760
you can already made in the early you

1301
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,280
know in the mid 1980s so not much has

1302
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,140
changed you could say in that in that

1303
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,280
respect

1304
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,140
and the fourth role I think this is

1305
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,520
something that was relatively new

1306
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,079
perhaps also picked up more on the

1307
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,119
European side of the discussion and

1308
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,640
which was not really at all really

1309
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,980
picked up by the by the alley School of

1310
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,200
urbanism is an important role of the

1311
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,839
state yeah staying investing in cultural

1312
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,880
landmarks but also really developing all

1313
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,040
kinds of cultural economic policies yeah

1314
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,500
so this is what more or less it would

1315
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,880
have to give let's say a nutshell

1316
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,640
definition or a listing of key elements

1317
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,520
what the symbolic economy literature is

1318
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,240
more or less about

1319
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,599
few examples

1320
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,640
one interesting article that Paul Knox

1321
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,579
the rest of those Urban landscape early

1322
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:56,280
1990s where we argued very much along

1323
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,740
jamesonian lines there's widespread

1324
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,960
agreements that the emergence of

1325
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,720
post-modern architecture culture and

1326
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,720
philosophy in Western Society has

1327
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,000
proceeded in tandling with the emergence

1328
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,520
of globalized more flexible forms of

1329
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,619
capitalist Enterprise

1330
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,559
or second part of that quote

1331
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:18,000
post-modernism as the cultural closing

1332
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,700
of advanced capitalism you know so this

1333
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,160
is basically Jameson all over again this

1334
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,859
idea two sides of the same goal I

1335
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:27,960
register a question here because I mean

1336
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,819
I would question if there was really

1337
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,220
that kind of widespread agreement yes

1338
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,140
there was widespread agreement on this

1339
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,559
claim within Marx's political economy

1340
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:40,920
and yes marxian political economy became

1341
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,599
let's say especially within geography

1342
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,180
that's a pretty not dominant But Central

1343
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,579
to the debate I would say in the 1980s

1344
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,740
and 1990s or especially in the early

1345
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,859
1990s and this is part of that kind of

1346
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,619
explanatory logic yeah I personally I

1347
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:58,079
mean I mean see much to agree with and

1348
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,700
these kinds of claims but I don't think

1349
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,400
actually that that let's say cultural

1350
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,920
expressions are always that easily the

1351
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,260
other side of the same coin of the of

1352
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,240
let's say the capitalist political

1353
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,920
economy yeah so if there's more

1354
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,140
complexity there that is easily let's

1355
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,420
say simplified

1356
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,240
um so this is important to keep in mind

1357
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,980
unless of course you fully agree with

1358
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,400
this argument which is which is possible

1359
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,579
foreign

1360
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,960
so the point about the rise of a new

1361
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,880
Miller Glass again in the same article

1362
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,160
knocks offers a quite a useful summary I

1363
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,059
find

1364
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,040
yeah it makes a couple of claims which

1365
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,140
is not specific to Knox but I think

1366
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,180
specific or or representative let's say

1367
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,680
this wider literature

1368
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,420
first he says well and this is the shift

1369
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,059
to post industrialism the emergence of

1370
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:56,339
new class fractions under Advanced

1371
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,160
capitalism yeah so we see dominant

1372
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,900
classes but actually they change over

1373
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,940
time but so the structurally speaking

1374
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,980
let's say this hierarchy remains but

1375
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,440
different class fractions might emerge

1376
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,240
to become dominant this is what not

1377
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,339
under Advanced capitalism you see the

1378
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:13,140
emergence of new class fractions or the

1379
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,240
new middle class under Advanced

1380
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,260
capitalism

1381
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,660
that's the economic arguments the

1382
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,240
cultural argument would be this was also

1383
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,579
a generational reaction against

1384
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,440
modernist Aesthetics

1385
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,900
let's see the children growing up in the

1386
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,059
1960s rebelled against their modernist

1387
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,040
parents and thus started proporting

1388
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,599
different ways of Behaving different

1389
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,180
ways of cultural preferences yeah

1390
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,980
it's not wrong it's highly simplified

1391
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,020
but it's not it's not wrong of course so

1392
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,240
that's you could say the socio-cultural

1393
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,619
uh

1394
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:46,140
related to this this related to that

1395
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,940
let's say this move away this critique

1396
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,300
of of modernism you really referred more

1397
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,280
to the kind of lifestyle orientation but

1398
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,920
you can look at positively art becomes

1399
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,599
part of everyday life yeah this is

1400
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,040
something that does not use something

1401
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,960
that is separate from us no it becomes

1402
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,180
even more radical but you can also look

1403
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,339
at it more critically or it just becomes

1404
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:07,140
another commodity it's just a question

1405
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,940
of lifestyle of showing your identity

1406
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,920
showing off your identity yeah so

1407
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,319
there's a lifestyle orientation

1408
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,599
self-realization expression and I need

1409
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,579
free responsibility cultural politics

1410
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,559
true sort of culture you position

1411
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:24,079
yourself as a citizen in many ways

1412
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:26,220
for Local Economic explanation as

1413
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,720
already into that is this kind of

1414
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,940
commodity Aesthetics a kind of Niche

1415
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,280
oriented consumption with emphasis on

1416
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,020
tastes and Aesthetics and hence an

1417
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,940
increased role for design also someone

1418
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,640
like Paul Knox and later work he

1419
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,740
specifically focus on Urban Design or

1420
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:44,579
design the design sector as a central

1421
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:47,819
sector in advanced capitalism yeah and

1422
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:49,260
we can also we can all understand how

1423
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,880
this works I mean I think we're all

1424
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,420
parts in a way of this group right so I

1425
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,400
wear disclosing but not that close even

1426
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,960
though it's exactly the same as just a

1427
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,300
slightly different color right I wear

1428
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,339
these shoes but not these shoes or I

1429
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:05,400
want wooden floors or not these kinds of

1430
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,500
floors in my house depending on which

1431
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,720
phased in your life your life you are

1432
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,359
right it's pretty Niche but still we

1433
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:13,980
have very strong opinions about this

1434
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,480
yeah don't start talking to me about

1435
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,220
music I have very strong opinions about

1436
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,559
music but if I look at it for more

1437
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:21,900
distance uh obviously I have to admit

1438
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,059
that it's pretty Niche yeah so now I

1439
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,140
sort of

1440
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,040
um

1441
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,559
let's see I uh let's say establish

1442
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,960
distinctions between what is good bad or

1443
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,420
better or or not as good yeah it's

1444
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,520
pretty specific yeah so I think this is

1445
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,260
important this is really about this

1446
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,059
Niche oriented consumption that has

1447
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:42,059
increased I think rapidly over the last

1448
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:43,859
30 years I think this is not something

1449
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:47,220
that we saw to such an extent

1450
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,440
if you would go to the 1980s for example

1451
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,579
in the early 1980s

1452
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,359
cultured Urban Redevelopment so another

1453
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,980
strand I would say that is really part

1454
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,260
of this kind of debate

1455
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,940
um even earlier indeed I forgot that

1456
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,020
it's this early

1457
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,640
one of the earliest probably the first

1458
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,260
book actually by Sharon zukin it's

1459
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,700
called love living

1460
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,440
I guess most of you would also know

1461
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,940
Sharon zukin who has done a lot of work

1462
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,460
in culture in the city

1463
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,319
and law of living was already published

1464
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,079
in 1982. I think she was early for her

1465
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,660
time so it's not uh you could say not

1466
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,160
that typical but it was really a

1467
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,319
foundational book I think and it really

1468
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:27,660
shapes still many of the debates that

1469
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,280
we're having today around the role of

1470
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,079
artists in particular in urban settings

1471
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:32,280
yeah

1472
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,440
so around love living which was New York

1473
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,300
oriented and there were lofts in New

1474
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,619
York but there are lofts in New York

1475
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:39,780
which of course does not apply to every

1476
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,000
city but structurally speaking you can

1477
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,160
see similar processes at least in larger

1478
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,140
cities I would say

1479
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,420
what did she argue okay we have let's

1480
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,760
say abandoned moths anti-locks and we

1481
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,040
see a reoccupancy of abandoned

1482
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,319
structures by artists so early 1980s

1483
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:57,420
we're talking about here also New York

1484
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,339
at the height you could say of its

1485
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:01,800
crisis and let's say at the deep end of

1486
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,960
this development yeah but there's the

1487
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,880
first thing a reoccupancy of abandoned

1488
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,220
structures by ours this is Then followed

1489
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,680
by a new middle class yeah so the

1490
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,300
artists move in first it's still

1491
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,740
roughing Rowdy but then the new Miller

1492
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,540
class it moves in and it gets a bit more

1493
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,520
a bit more let's see clean a bit more

1494
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,220
fancy which she calls a reconquest of

1495
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,420
the inner city

1496
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:24,180
leading to a kind of Loft lifestyle they

1497
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,339
have people living in

1498
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:28,800
let's see dwellings that do not

1499
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,660
represent your classical at certainly at

1500
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,880
that point in time Suburban let's say

1501
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,099
one Family household so you have to come

1502
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:37,920
up with a new architectural style a new

1503
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,780
way of imagining how to live in these

1504
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,339
laws yeah

1505
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:43,500
his size and also become an increasing

1506
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,359
terrain of conflict between competing

1507
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,300
users both between Alton advances if the

1508
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,880
inhabitants if they were still there

1509
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,559
artists and a new middle class yeah

1510
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,359
where artists use Lofts also as a

1511
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:56,520
production infrastructure to produce art

1512
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,980
the new middle class by and large used

1513
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,500
these laws as residential infrastructure

1514
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,800
yeah and you work somewhere else yeah

1515
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,260
and then culture is also in a very early

1516
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,420
on especially even from the early 1980s

1517
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,420
owners in New York was used to develop

1518
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,700
and profit from him from an emergent

1519
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,680
real estate market so real estate

1520
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,619
intermediaries very early on realize

1521
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:22,260
that ah these artists moving in suddenly

1522
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,300
this area becomes interesting becomes

1523
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,000
visible at the very least and thus we

1524
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,800
can actually use this we can exploit

1525
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,420
this this is something we can build on

1526
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,760
yeah we can start identifying this we

1527
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,760
can start selling this for a profit yeah

1528
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,099
now this was early 1980s I mean if and

1529
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,319
if I tell you this story it's pretty

1530
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,720
clear I would think being you all being

1531
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,720
Urban Scholars that this Rings this

1532
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,579
resonates let's put it at those terms

1533
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:49,799
resonates with discussions you see on an

1534
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:51,180
everyday level and most of the cities

1535
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,400
that you're familiar with yeah this idea

1536
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,680
that ah that us identifying areas this

1537
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,960
is like a Proto a proto-definition of

1538
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,099
gentrification or cultural

1539
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:02,160
gentrification yeah so when I think if I

1540
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,440
think of an area such as I know in

1541
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,780
Russell such as sanjul to some extent

1542
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,380
this logic is followed yeah and I mean

1543
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,359
I'm not familiar with too many cities

1544
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:14,400
but I see similar things happening in

1545
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,200
Berlin or so and you still see it

1546
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,059
happening and saw it happening and then

1547
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:21,599
many other cities where this is the case

1548
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,299
for this has been a major strand of

1549
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:25,920
research for quite a long time already

1550
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,619
and it has been refined Etc but it still

1551
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:32,299
shapes shapes the discussion

1552
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:43,079
so ultimately of course there's also and

1553
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,640
again this has also received research

1554
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,260
attention but also means that artists

1555
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,720
have become both drivers and victims of

1556
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,119
Urban Development yeah it is a similar

1557
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,180
article from that time ourselves

1558
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,540
which shows our artists were well really

1559
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,480
the earlier let's say the the movers to

1560
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,280
move into a certain area and to start

1561
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,900
developing the area true Building

1562
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,339
Development to a lot of development or

1563
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,140
other types of uh Building Development

1564
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,740
but then when the the the area the

1565
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,960
neighborhood had reached a certain stage

1566
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,700
of development and real estate prices

1567
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,980
odds then again we're in a sense moved

1568
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,000
out because they couldn't no longer

1569
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,700
afford uh to live there except those

1570
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,559
perhaps that were smart enough to buy at

1571
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,780
an early stage but this was rarely uh

1572
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,280
the case but then they had so they were

1573
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,559
both drivers and victims of urban change

1574
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,859
and this again hasn't changed that much

1575
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:33,720
over the last 30 years except that

1576
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,240
perhaps this phenomenon has globalized

1577
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,700
and it has become a much more strategic

1578
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,660
uh government uh well much more let's

1579
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:45,059
say forceful government strategy so this

1580
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,920
is in a way mainstream Urban Development

1581
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,420
by now

1582
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,940
okay looking at the time let's take a

1583
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,859
quick break uh and then I'll continue

1584
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:55,619
with the second part or let's see the

1585
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:59,000

all right let's continue

1625
01:11:39,739 --> 01:11:43,820
that's my first announcements

1626
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,400
foreign

1627
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:20,159
everything

1628
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,540
yeah okay let's go

1629
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,460
um so we're still in the symbolic

1630
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,260
economy part

1631
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,900
um and I'm discussing different strands

1632
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,699
or what I mean this is lesson identified

1633
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:47,280
by me so what I consider to be a

1634
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,840
relatively clear and body of leadership

1635
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,340
within this body of literature there are

1636
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:52,500
a number of different strands of let's

1637
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,320
say research attention yeah so before

1638
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,960
and I just finished the part on let's

1639
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,179
say cultural Redevelopment

1640
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:02,580
now in last part within that section I

1641
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,260
would argue really focuses on

1642
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,600
representation of urban space now please

1643
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,400
understand every strength that I discuss

1644
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,500
I can only do so much in a two-hour

1645
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,500
lecture minus the breaks But please

1646
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,840
understand every strand as potential

1647
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,940
let's say lives of Investigation for

1648
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,860
yourself for a paper for your

1649
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:22,679
Massachusetts whatever right just I'm

1650
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:24,420
trying to let's say hopefully give some

1651
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:26,460
inspiration as to what possible teams

1652
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,560
possible topics are that you might want

1653
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,080
to engage with in more detail so this

1654
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,420
isn't also for me a bit I want to see us

1655
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:36,480
as my role in in especially for those

1656
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,580
here in their first semester of their

1657
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,699
first year Masters what I see as my role

1658
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:44,219
just giving a few let's say 400 few

1659
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,320
ideas about what could potentially be

1660
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,760
interesting to do more research about

1661
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,400
yeah so one element here is

1662
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,679
representation of urban space this is

1663
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:55,140
probably a relatively straightforward

1664
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,179
exercise where a lot of attention

1665
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:59,699
recently and especially also outside of

1666
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:02,159
urban studies in marketing it's

1667
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,500
cruciatingly boring but still that's not

1668
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,780
a discussion but we should investigated

1669
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,640
the role of media and marketing in

1670
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,820
putting cities on the map yeah yeah I

1671
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,800
mean I should say Nuance there's a lot

1672
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,300
of boring research being done in this

1673
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,440
field there's also some interesting

1674
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,659
research being done in this field but

1675
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:21,360
some of this very very instrumental yeah

1676
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,580
so there's this research that focuses on

1677
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,340
Urban images what kind of images do we

1678
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,840
have in mind when we think about cities

1679
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,460
how we can really sort of change these

1680
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:32,699
images also contested images yeah and we

1681
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:34,739
all will have let's say City images in

1682
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:36,239
our mind when you're not going to do the

1683
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,280
quiz now whatever would ask you to sort

1684
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,260
of I wouldn't mention the city I would

1685
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:43,199
ask you to to to mention the image the

1686
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,880
first image that pops up in your ads

1687
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,860
then it's quite clear there will be a

1688
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,600
large element of consensus I think

1689
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,179
within the audience yeah Paris Eiffel

1690
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:52,679
Tower I mean something like that right

1691
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:55,320
so the couple of uh cliches

1692
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,300
this has become increasingly important

1693
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,239
and debates also around Urban tourism

1694
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,219
especially European cities have always

1695
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:05,340
been key sites for tourism yeah so

1696
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,780
there's The Grand Tour there's sort of

1697
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:08,840
let's say the upper middle classes

1698
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,880
Aristocrats between let's say European

1699
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,040
Elites who have let's say traveled to

1700
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,679
and around Europe two different European

1701
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,780
cities but this has become let's say

1702
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,659
massified over the last 60 70 years

1703
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:24,420
early after World War II yeah and it

1704
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,219
just really that's it to like to its own

1705
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:27,800
development around Urban tourism

1706
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,880
explicitly of course let's see the whole

1707
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,460
discussion about America yeah Airbnb

1708
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:36,780
would also fit in here yeah this has

1709
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:38,340
increased they also been picked up where

1710
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,280
you could say it was to some extent

1711
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,380
firm driven that's the entrepreneur

1712
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,600
driven this has increasingly been picked

1713
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,659
up by most local and National States as

1714
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:50,820
important development strategies for the

1715
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:51,480
local

1716
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,800
government

1717
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,800
and the focus on tourism as an important

1718
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,500
driver for your economy it's a highly

1719
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,120
volatile economy of course and this is

1720
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,000
something we now see with covert well in

1721
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,860
a very clear sense suddenly everything

1722
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,620
falls flat and therefore that's for

1723
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,360
locally conscious rely heavily on

1724
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,580
tourism that's obviously is is quite a

1725
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,020
disaster

1726
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,340
um if we're economically speaking of

1727
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,659
course socially speaking that's another

1728
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:18,120
discussion that is a nice book also

1729
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,500
that's why I just mentioned it here I'm

1730
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,179
not going to discuss it

1731
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:24,300
but in any detail by mayor Greenback

1732
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,940
in a new upside branding New York how a

1733
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,440
Sydney in crisis was sold to the world

1734
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,480
which traces a bit let's say The

1735
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,159
Branding of New York from the 1980s

1736
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,739
onwards our city at let's say at the

1737
01:16:34,739 --> 01:16:37,500
bottom ends uh being confronted without

1738
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,320
migration actually tried to reinvent

1739
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,960
itself through its images in order to

1740
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,060
become let's say more attractive again

1741
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,699
open question of course if The Branding

1742
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:49,380
has played the most important role in

1743
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,420
the city becoming more attractive but

1744
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:54,840
certainly it has played a role in this

1745
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,300
okay

1746
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,000
last part in the role of the states uh

1747
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,800
very briefly

1748
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,719
um again this is debate that has been

1749
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:05,760
picked up both in urban studies as well

1750
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,560
as outside of urban studies from a

1751
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,880
cultural perspective especially in

1752
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,440
literature specifically on cultural

1753
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,900
policies which is a dedicated field of

1754
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,600
research on its own

1755
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,040
um

1756
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,960
which I would say you see a couple of

1757
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,820
things we see strategies aimed at really

1758
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,560
developing cultural Industries I have

1759
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,360
myself done research on on this whole

1760
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,520
debate around cultural Industries which

1761
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,260
is very much about Local Economic

1762
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,360
Development this idea that you actually

1763
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,120
attract artists cultural workers to your

1764
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,360
city in in order to sort of develop your

1765
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,340
local economies much research attention

1766
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,560
has gone into this since the 1990s but

1767
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,440
especially 2000s yeah there's also

1768
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,140
research around large-scale events World

1769
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:48,780
fairs art exhibitions again this has a

1770
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,239
much much longer history it transcends

1771
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:52,739
also Urban studies as a discipline

1772
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:54,840
because if you look at let's say a

1773
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,840
discipline such as art history that has

1774
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,920
done excellent work on let's say

1775
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,780
Arts exhibitions and World fairs from

1776
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,940
the mid-19th century onwards yeah so

1777
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,640
yeah we're always let's say events to

1778
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,560
attract a global or this European

1779
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,219
audience to your city but again this has

1780
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:16,980
become increasingly kind of economic

1781
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,960
strategy so you want to attract the

1782
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,760
Olympic Games you want to attract a

1783
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,699
biannual or you want to have a

1784
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,800
Etc yeah there's also been increasing

1785
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,960
critiqued because often there's a lot of

1786
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,360
investment going into this but what

1787
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,640
actually is that's it it delivers then

1788
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,219
it turns out to be quite Limited

1789
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:36,719
and more broadly I think there's

1790
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,640
literature again from the 1980s all the

1791
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,040
word squash related to work by zukin on

1792
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,960
the Arts and the urban growth machine as

1793
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,719
it was called in the 1980s certainly

1794
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,060
which really focuses on let's say Arts

1795
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,580
networks Elite networks and arts

1796
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:52,739
institute Arts institutions as local

1797
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:55,320
attractors for invert investment and

1798
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,600
Urban Development yeah so there's a

1799
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,940
classic example if you look at

1800
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:03,060
sorry the museum built in the gubernet

1801
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,159
museum in Bilbao that's an always

1802
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:08,340
mentioned case when it comes to uh you

1803
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,860
place a museum in a relatively run down

1804
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,840
City I'm simplifying here and this

1805
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,880
should really boost the local economy

1806
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,920
and to some extent it did again with

1807
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,140
many issues attached to it but it's not

1808
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,320
completely false yeah so there this is

1809
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,520
work that has received a lot of

1810
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,880
attention also

1811
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,420
here one more recent example uh not sure

1812
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:33,360
if the city needed you could say this uh

1813
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,100
it was certainly not a round run-down

1814
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,840
City in a sense does anyone know this

1815
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,199
example

1816
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,340
so it's the M plus Museum in Hong Kong

1817
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,960
actually which actually was just open I

1818
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,179
think two one or two weeks ago two weeks

1819
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:50,820
ago designed by star Architects Herzog

1820
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:55,140
in the Miron uh and a well a uh a

1821
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,960
typical UKC example of a city that is

1822
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,159
both

1823
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:01,080
aimed at attracting and perhaps

1824
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,460
improving you would say the cultural

1825
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,860
image of Hong Kong but attracting uh

1826
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,380
let's say tourism to the city but also

1827
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:09,120
as a kind of

1828
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,540
uh let's see

1829
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,920
advertisement for the city and to some

1830
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,840
extent in a very little sense because

1831
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,300
the the main building side you say is

1832
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,060
one big LCD screen at the same time next

1833
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,500
to being a museum so you could actually

1834
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,140
sort of literally see how this is a kind

1835
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,360
of commodity aesthetic right so very

1836
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:31,080
very literal manner

1837
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,880
but also for example big commercial

1838
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,100
artifacts such as the Art Basel who

1839
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,080
develop let's say

1840
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,239
um well which is now staging I'm not

1841
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:40,500
quite sure what the current state is

1842
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,420
because also covertly messed up a lot

1843
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,060
but what it was is a stage annual art

1844
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,239
fairs in Basel in Miami and in Hong Kong

1845
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,400
um not only do these events attract

1846
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,980
wealthy Visitors by and large yeah they

1847
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,540
also spend there in these cities so

1848
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:55,739
again it becomes a kind of local

1849
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:58,860
development machine yeah more recently

1850
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:01,320
Art Basel also started a so-called Art

1851
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,719
Basel cities initiative where I try to

1852
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:07,140
have events in different cities which in

1853
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,000
this case Buenos Aires is one example

1854
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,640
which supposedly should benefit the Art

1855
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,040
Basel because it can globalize more but

1856
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,659
also other cities across the world who

1857
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:17,699
do not have the annual art fairs can

1858
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:19,560
supposedly benefit from let's see the

1859
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,360
name and reputation of the art barsing

1860
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,420
and we see these kinds of initiatives

1861
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,920
emerging quite forcefully over the last

1862
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,460
especially over the last 10-15 years

1863
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:32,179
okay

1864
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,820
last section for today and I'm actually

1865
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,540
doing quite well on time so um I also

1866
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,300
won't discuss this uh unless not every

1867
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,739
every bullet point on the slide

1868
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,659
but just as a kind of wrapping wrapping

1869
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:49,860
up

1870
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,500
to reposition let's say my my debate

1871
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,360
which was let's say mostly oriented

1872
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,480
within urban geography but to reposition

1873
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,460
it again within a broader debate on the

1874
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:01,080
spatial term yeah so much of what I

1875
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,699
discussed was launching a geographical

1876
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:06,239
concern or geographical concerns but the

1877
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:08,699
spatial turn more broadly frames that

1878
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:11,580
kind of debate foreign

1879
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:14,640
so just to wrap up in the late 20th

1880
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,440
century urban geography was heavily

1881
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,060
influenced by the cultural term this I

1882
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,219
discussed yeah so I related the based on

1883
01:22:20,219 --> 01:22:22,260
post-modernism and globalization yeah

1884
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:24,600
this has had to in effect let's say the

1885
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,760
epistemological methodological effects

1886
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,679
was that there was an increased interest

1887
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:32,360
in ethnography everyday life imaginaries

1888
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,520
representations or in short culture yeah

1889
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,900
so this is really what I think has

1890
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,020
shaped much of urban geography over the

1891
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,420
last uh well 30 years

1892
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,460
across the social science and this is

1893
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,280
how I opened my lecture of today this uh

1894
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,199
cultural turn intertwined with an

1895
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,420
increased interest in spatial

1896
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:53,280
configurations so let's say urban

1897
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,440
geography is already into that became

1898
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,000
more interested in cultural questions

1899
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,699
the cultural disciplines which I would

1900
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:01,199
say is cultural studies and and

1901
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:02,719
anthropology

1902
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:04,860
became more interested in spatial

1903
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,239
questions yeah

1904
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:08,219
so there were a number of reasons for

1905
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:11,040
this one is and I addressed this in some

1906
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,120
other lectures

1907
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,640
one is a kind of really post 1989

1908
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,800
obsession with globalization

1909
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,219
on one level one superficial level

1910
01:23:19,219 --> 01:23:22,800
globalization is or is is the end of

1911
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,540
spatial questions because everything is

1912
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:27,060
global yeah but it actually intensified

1913
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,679
this concern with spatial questions

1914
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:30,620
because it soon became clear of course

1915
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:34,199
that it was a process that actually had

1916
01:23:34,199 --> 01:23:36,000
spatial effects the other spatial

1917
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,159
process there was a stretching of social

1918
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,800
relations taking place which could be

1919
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,960
and and needed to be understood in a

1920
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,140
spatial manner yeah connecting a to B uh

1921
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,060
as a spatial effect and it leads to

1922
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,080
different let's say spatial

1923
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,600
configuration

1924
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,380
uh social sciences Humanities sorry yeah

1925
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:57,360
in order to be able to fit everything on

1926
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,400
an already too crowded slide I had to

1927
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,260
sort of

1928
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,940
across the social sciences and

1929
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:05,219
Humanities yeah so the creating interest

1930
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:07,020
in spatial crash and spatial questions

1931
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:08,280
and this of course is where the

1932
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,500
geography starts becoming let's say an

1933
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,420
inspirational discipline for other

1934
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,159
disciplines this is exactly what happens

1935
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,060
in the 1990s especially

1936
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,140
hence an increased interaction between

1937
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:20,640
our job to Urban methropology and

1938
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,260
cultural studies which are already

1939
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:25,280
hinted at

1940
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,420
um

1941
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,980
I'm only going to go quickly through

1942
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,960
this but uh the the slides are slightly

1943
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,880
more detailed

1944
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:33,600
um

1945
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,420
because I added these slides because not

1946
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:38,460
let's say

1947
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,920
the elements I discussed in the previous

1948
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,600
slides the previous one hour and 20

1949
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,400
minutes or so

1950
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,400
um cover I would say most of what is

1951
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,040
relevant concern the culture in urban

1952
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,860
geography over the last 30 40 years

1953
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,360
which is already quite a challenge to

1954
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,640
fit that into a two-hour lecture but it

1955
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,620
really misses also some elements so I

1956
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,540
mean I propose let's say quietly let's

1957
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:02,940
say in a way a linear trajectory of how

1958
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:04,380
previous discussions influence current

1959
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:05,940
discussions and that had an effect on

1960
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,980
this but in parallel of course there

1961
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,480
were also discussions and I just want to

1962
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,880
briefly hint at it because there's again

1963
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,440
these are all of us that have become

1964
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,060
more or less important but they can't

1965
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:17,400
really necessarily Trace back to some of

1966
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,500
the elements to let's say Friday Jameson

1967
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:20,580
for example

1968
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,500
so there are two

1969
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,500
core teams perhaps that have also really

1970
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,699
shaped

1971
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:27,540
um

1972
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,520
interdisciplinary Urban studies over the

1973
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,560
last couple of years and that in a way

1974
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,320
have emerged more more forcefully from

1975
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,239
disciplines outside of geography but

1976
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,580
it's definitely let's say informing

1977
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:41,580
Urban studies at large which for me is a

1978
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,580
very interdisciplinary discipline uh

1979
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:47,280
up to this day two elements one

1980
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,699
informality second everyday life

1981
01:25:49,699 --> 01:25:52,199
informality for those that have studied

1982
01:25:52,199 --> 01:25:54,300
ethnography and topology they will they

1983
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,400
will become have been well will be quite

1984
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,260
familiar with this term

1985
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:58,920
um

1986
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,540
is historically and I'll give some

1987
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:02,820
examples there a religion has looked

1988
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,860
specifically on coming from also

1989
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,620
Economic Development perspectives or

1990
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,400
developmentalists perspectives to some

1991
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,679
extent focusing on labor markets

1992
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:13,199
precarious work migration legality

1993
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,060
political governance and conversations

1994
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:17,580
I'll unpacked this in a minute

1995
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:20,280
everyday life partially overlapping but

1996
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,560
partially coming from uh whereas this

1997
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,780
tends to become simplifying you from

1998
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:27,120
from anthropology everyday life tends to

1999
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:27,960
come

2000
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:30,239
but I would say is cultural studies as a

2001
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:31,820
discipline that emerged in the 1980s

2002
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:34,860
focusing very much on agency community

2003
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:37,560
community building resistance off on

2004
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,659
local level of Lifestyle driven

2005
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:42,480
consumption identity media and

2006
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,179
representation yeah so and precisely

2007
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:46,620
these terms those that read the

2008
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,719
newspaper provides there's this

2009
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,880
obsession with some of these terms as

2010
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,920
that they want to critique and that

2011
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,480
emerge I think most falsely from

2012
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,100
cultural studies obviously the the

2013
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,840
critics have never read cultural studies

2014
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,440
but that's another discussion

2015
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:04,560
uh let me see

2016
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,659
now in formality I mentioning this here

2017
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:08,219
because this has become a special last

2018
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:10,020
10 years Urban studies I mean there's so

2019
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,820
much research taking place now on on

2020
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:14,820
informality and the urban uh but it's

2021
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,440
important to keep in mind that this was

2022
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,880
already a classic team within Urban

2023
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,040
anthropology and development economics

2024
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:23,159
especially from the early 1970s onwards

2025
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:25,080
an article always references the one by

2026
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,460
Keith Hart in formal income

2027
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,139
opportunities in urban employment in

2028
01:27:28,139 --> 01:27:30,780
Ghana and the title itself already makes

2029
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:33,780
pretty clear what uh well where he

2030
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,520
stands and what the topic is right it is

2031
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,320
really about local labor markets it's

2032
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,480
about Local Economic Development yeah

2033
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,880
but what did Keith Hart and many others

2034
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,820
with him argue there is a lot of and I

2035
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:46,440
think it's something that maybe julvin

2036
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,120
Hammond is lecture for European cities

2037
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,980
in an organizing World also picked up on

2038
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:52,860
what is registered to be part of the

2039
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:55,380
economy is only part of what is what

2040
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,239
what we should consider as economic

2041
01:27:57,239 --> 01:27:59,580
activities yeah so we have formal

2042
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:02,699
economic practices businesses that pay

2043
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:04,199
taxes and that are registered as

2044
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:06,179
businesses but there's a lot of

2045
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:08,820
employment Beyond these forward economic

2046
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:11,639
practices so beyond governments Beyond

2047
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:13,679
firms Beyond factories Beyond

2048
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:16,620
large-scale Commerce yeah so this is

2049
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:18,360
where the distinction between informal

2050
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,699
and formal comes from yeah

2051
01:28:20,699 --> 01:28:23,760
so this is important to keep in mind

2052
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,340
this of course gets slippery because in

2053
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,540
some literature

2054
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,520
this and this comes together right then

2055
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,020
you say well actually the informal is

2056
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:33,060
illegitimate and the formal is the

2057
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,219
legitimate but that is only partial or

2058
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:36,780
partially true I mean we can have a

2059
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:38,400
discussion about what's legitimate

2060
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,500
unless for example say we'll we'll all

2061
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,380
agree that someone taking care at all of

2062
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,940
their children because the constitutes

2063
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:47,760
work but we I think we also all agree

2064
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,880
that this is not illegitimate

2065
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,820
well far from it right so whereas drug

2066
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:57,060
trafficking uh is probably informal

2067
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,760
because it's not registered as such but

2068
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,920
many would also consider it illegitimate

2069
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,420
again we can have a discussion on this

2070
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:04,980
if that makes sense that distinction

2071
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,659
yeah

2072
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:08,699
now this is how to constantly merged and

2073
01:29:08,699 --> 01:29:10,020
this is interesting because this is one

2074
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,360
of the not few cars but one of the key

2075
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,820
Concepts that have really traveled from

2076
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:17,280
the global South to Global North yeah so

2077
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,840
this is where work that emerged most

2078
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,540
forcefully in research on the global

2079
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,580
South yeah and this is terminology

2080
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,340
that's really sort of it traveled

2081
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,800
it doesn't happen too often you could

2082
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,420
say

2083
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,280
so I mean in terms such as post-modern

2084
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,840
urbanism in a way is the opposite

2085
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,260
example

2086
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,780
apparently

2087
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,600
I'll just check in just one sec

2088
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,580
now in urban anthropology if you look at

2089
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:51,920
informality

2090
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,300
it leads to a lot of research on

2091
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,060
opportunities but also precarious uh

2092
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,340
precarities created by unregulated

2093
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:01,620
economic activities so there's a strong

2094
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:04,500
interest in gender Dimensions so people

2095
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,320
women working on markets working at home

2096
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,000
so this is really about let's say what

2097
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,739
what the bread and butter of a lot of

2098
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,120
urban anthropology

2099
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,100
as well as transnational Dimensions

2100
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,659
particularly this Dimension I think has

2101
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:17,400
been picked up most most clearly in

2102
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,620
let's say the more cultural work uh in

2103
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,020
urban studies so for example many Street

2104
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,520
vendors also being transnational

2105
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,920
migrants hearing a picture of LA rambla

2106
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,920
and Barcelona so illegal migrants doing

2107
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,320
working on the in the city

2108
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,120
and it raises questions of economic

2109
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,400
survival most obviously but also

2110
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,500
questions of of the governors of these

2111
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,679
markets of of the political identity of

2112
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:42,120
these actors or the cultural social

2113
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:44,520
identity of these actors and with a

2114
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,320
nervous studies is a particular this

2115
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,880
strand of research which has really led

2116
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,100
to a boom I think of research and

2117
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:53,100
informal uh on informal urbanism yeah

2118
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,139
I'll pick up some of these elements in

2119
01:30:55,139 --> 01:30:57,420
my lecture uh next week

2120
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,340
now that's very brief I mean I could

2121
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,260
have two three lectures for sure on

2122
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,420
informality as a concept as a practice

2123
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,100
and how it's picked up in different

2124
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,199
strands of research just as a kind of

2125
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:08,820
stepping stone please understand this as

2126
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,800
a stepping stone to let's say the more

2127
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,420
contemporary research that I will

2128
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:15,360
discuss next week the second strand of

2129
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,760
research which hasn't been much part of

2130
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,320
let's see the poorest Modern urbanism

2131
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:22,320
Trend the symbolic economy trance is the

2132
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,719
literature on everyday life I myself

2133
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:26,639
have been partially trained in cultural

2134
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,400
studies and everyday life was a concept

2135
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,139
that popped up that this was like

2136
01:31:31,139 --> 01:31:32,880
regularly used all the time from the

2137
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,540
late 1980s 1990s onwards it was really

2138
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:40,500
used as a key as a key uh well topic

2139
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,679
what does the term basically entail in

2140
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,360
most cases because ultimately it's also

2141
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,860
not more than a buzzword there's a lot

2142
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:49,139
of theory behind it yeah but ultimately

2143
01:31:49,139 --> 01:31:51,179
it entails a key concern with Lyft

2144
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:53,639
experiences of people and the meanings

2145
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:56,100
constructed by subjects in their own

2146
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:59,280
world so classic cultural concerns if

2147
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,920
you wish yeah

2148
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:04,139
so most of this leisure in in in

2149
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:07,139
cultural studies on everyday life tends

2150
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:09,480
to also position people as active agents

2151
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,400
rather than as passive consumers or

2152
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,400
passive recipients of political power so

2153
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,960
this automatically leads to this kind of

2154
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,020
debate on strategies versus tactics and

2155
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,000
so the resistance people can have on the

2156
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,400
ground in relation to see the structures

2157
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,380
they are confronted they are well they

2158
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:27,120
are confronted with

2159
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,260
um

2160
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:30,239
I'll skip this part because there's also

2161
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,820
another part in anthropology which also

2162
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,980
addresses this

2163
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,840
um

2164
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,699
and this also makes I think the everyday

2165
01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:41,219
a truly transdisciplinary concept I mean

2166
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:43,020
again there are not too many Concepts

2167
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,360
that are truly transdisciplinary I try

2168
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,920
to understand Urban studies as a

2169
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,300
discipline that is much broader than

2170
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,040
specific disciplinary debates because

2171
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,719
it's just very boring to stick to one

2172
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:54,120
discipline yeah but the everyday has

2173
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:57,060
really emerged from the 1970s 1980s and

2174
01:32:57,060 --> 01:32:59,460
as a truly transdisciplinary concept so

2175
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:01,500
again similar to the postmodern I think

2176
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,600
a question that was raised at the back

2177
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,480
there is no such thing as one postmodern

2178
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,460
if you look at different disciplines the

2179
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:10,260
way they understand the postmodern it's

2180
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,420
quite substantially different and

2181
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,340
sometimes even contradictory the same

2182
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,860
applies to the everyday yeah but one

2183
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:18,480
discipline or one other says about D

2184
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,360
every day might not overlap to a great

2185
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,159
degree with what another author writes

2186
01:33:23,159 --> 01:33:24,480
about you every day so you really have

2187
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,699
to look at disciplinary specifics in

2188
01:33:26,699 --> 01:33:28,620
order to understand it nevertheless

2189
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:31,920
there are it is it has emerged as a as a

2190
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,440
term as a concept it really connects

2191
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,360
cultural Theory with philosophy with

2192
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,460
Marxist is an ethnography with

2193
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:40,500
post-structuralism with sociology and

2194
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,659
with Aesthetics yeah so the many

2195
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,820
interesting let's see entry points also

2196
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:47,580
for you so for a study specifically next

2197
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,460
to an unavoidable

2198
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:52,739
uh the everyday who sees the everyday as

2199
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:55,500
a side of utopian possibility but also

2200
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,239
colonized by the commodity form so

2201
01:33:57,239 --> 01:33:58,920
that's commodity Aesthetics once again

2202
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,500
you'll I can only urge you I mean of

2203
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,820
course I'm not really fair is great we

2204
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:05,460
all like him Etc but there's also a lot

2205
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:06,719
of interesting work that has been done

2206
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:08,639
by other artists which is perhaps

2207
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,920
at least as relevant let's put it in

2208
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,719
those terms uh then then I'll really

2209
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,300
forever so please no no no no no more

2210
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,440
papers on the right to the city I've

2211
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:19,699
read enough of those that's

2212
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:21,600
for example Stuart Hall and Tony

2213
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,639
Jefferson classic British cultural

2214
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:25,560
studies uh some of you might be familiar

2215
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,719
with this over their work our special

2216
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:30,300
Stuart Hall I mean if not do read this

2217
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,219
work because it's pretty well it's very

2218
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:33,300
very good

2219
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,460
we're really looked looked at let's say

2220
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:37,980
subcultures every day as a symbolic

2221
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,840
opposition to a dominant order

2222
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,000
I'll just mention some keywords that top

2223
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,679
up here but this is terminology I think

2224
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:45,080
which has become

2225
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,219
internalized and much of her thinking

2226
01:34:47,219 --> 01:34:50,100
about Urban cultures resistance style

2227
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,800
social practices subcultures growth

2228
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,159
codes Urban use identity yeah

2229
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,260
terminology that was not

2230
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:00,480
used for the first time by Stuart Hall

2231
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,400
and others but they really theorized it

2232
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,900
and they really did something new with

2233
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,340
it yeah

2234
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:08,100
one caveat of forces especially early

2235
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,560
cultural studies work it was highly

2236
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:13,860
blind to gender the gender Dynamics yeah

2237
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:16,080
this was I mean the picture shows that

2238
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,300
it was used subculture was very much

2239
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:21,179
around male use subconscious yeah this

2240
01:35:21,179 --> 01:35:22,800
has partially been addressed by by

2241
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,679
artists such as Angeline like Robbie uh

2242
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,840
who's actually my my first PhD

2243
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,360
supervisor and feminist cultural studies

2244
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:33,300
but certainly let's say it kind of

2245
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,980
um underlying Trend in the early

2246
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,360
cultural studies tradition that it was

2247
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,940
pretty blind to to gender issues or also

2248
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,380
partially intersectional other

2249
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:42,300
intersection issues

2250
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,520
from quite a different angle but again

2251
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,860
it made an amazing book if I didn't book

2252
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:48,480
you could easily read it it's very well

2253
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,300
written the practice of Everyday Life by

2254
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:53,219
Michel de Certo

2255
01:35:53,219 --> 01:35:54,020
um

2256
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,400
translation obviously I think the French

2257
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,159
is uh maybe 10 years older already the

2258
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:00,480
original

2259
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,780
um more poetic but maybe focused on

2260
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:07,139
tactics tactics versus strategies uh so

2261
01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:09,360
the idea being that strategies are top

2262
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,639
down and people on the street they sort

2263
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:14,100
of engage with this and develop tactics

2264
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:15,659
in order to avoid

2265
01:36:15,659 --> 01:36:17,880
State strategies mostly government

2266
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:21,679
strategies so tactics are situated

2267
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:23,520
tactics as

2268
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,199
as

2269
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:26,820
resisting uh let's say broader

2270
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,739
structures this again is very much

2271
01:36:28,739 --> 01:36:30,420
shaped I'm not saying that everything is

2272
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:31,440
good about it because it's too

2273
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,739
dichotomous but it's a very

2274
01:36:33,739 --> 01:36:36,420
influential book that has really shaped

2275
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:38,639
much of the debate that form so next

2276
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,320
week I'll talk a bit more about let's

2277
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,239
say from the everyday to cultural work

2278
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,880
and activism a bit more about DIY

2279
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,239
urbanism where some of the DIY urbanism

2280
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,400
literature for example implicitly or

2281
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,080
explicitly refers to the type of stuff

2282
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:56,120
that is adored it already in 1980s

2283
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,400
okay

2284
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,540
just to conclude

2285
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:03,840
um

2286
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,820
as I mentioned the cultural tournament

2287
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,280
is to be understood as part of a wider

2288
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,380
shift in analytical sensibilities in the

2289
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:12,239
social sciences yeah

2290
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,980
I mean at the very beginning I said okay

2291
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:16,199
there's the empirical theoretical and

2292
01:37:16,199 --> 01:37:19,260
the methodological these are three takes

2293
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:22,320
on how we are how at that point we

2294
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,020
started looking differently at the world

2295
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,460
yeah

2296
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:30,179
so urban geography itself as one strand

2297
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:32,760
of debate within this broader cultural

2298
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,940
turn uh was and is I would argue heavily

2299
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:37,800
influenced by a Marxist or at least

2300
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,020
political economic interpretation of

2301
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,060
post-modernism as the cultural

2302
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,719
expression of late capitalism yeah

2303
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,860
you can also phrase it differently

2304
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:50,100
there's very little subtle Nuance

2305
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:53,300
cultural readings of let's say symbolic

2306
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,560
objects such as the Arts in urban

2307
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,360
geography for that mostly you have to

2308
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,639
move outside of geography because it

2309
01:37:59,639 --> 01:38:02,280
does not have this history of taking

2310
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,960
subtly about let's say cultural

2311
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,239
expressions yeah which doesn't mean it's

2312
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:07,920
not good but it's limited in that

2313
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,380
respect the work and symbol of economy

2314
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:12,300
in a way Builds on this but it has

2315
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:14,159
shifted the tension a bit more to

2316
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,800
questions of representation uh to urban

2317
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,960
lifestyles and cultural production yeah

2318
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,780
so the post-modern urbanism school was

2319
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:24,719
wasn't interested that much in artists

2320
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,540
producing actual pieces of work actual

2321
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,159
art that was most interested in

2322
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:31,080
consumption yeah so the commodity a

2323
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:32,880
study said yeah you buy something with

2324
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,500
which you identify as a lifestyle

2325
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,820
question

2326
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,460
and this is the last part that I discuss

2327
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,380
we see an increasing or we saw an

2328
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:43,440
increasing more in a sort of meeting in

2329
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,480
a halfway between urban geography

2330
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,639
cultural studies and anthropology as

2331
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:49,860
part of a broader spatial term so this

2332
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,239
is the funniest thing the interesting

2333
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:53,159
thing is that this cultural turn often

2334
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:55,739
also until the spatial turn yeah it came

2335
01:38:55,739 --> 01:38:59,159
it must emerge together in many ways

2336
01:38:59,159 --> 01:39:01,020
last point that I discuss is the

2337
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,520
research and informality in everyday

2338
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:05,280
life and related concerns as enormously

2339
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,860
contributed to a development of a truly

2340
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:09,900
interdisciplinary transdisciplinary form

2341
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:11,699
of cultural Urban studies I think these

2342
01:39:11,699 --> 01:39:13,320
are some of the some you see this

2343
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,239
happening in in the social science in

2344
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:16,199
the United States at large is that

2345
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:19,199
certain Concepts just resonate with

2346
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:20,760
research is coming from very different

2347
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:22,620
traditions and they become let's say

2348
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:24,719
bridging Concepts that bring together

2349
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:27,300
very different ways of thinking very

2350
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:29,280
different histories of writing and this

2351
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,500
is where uh most of them well the most

2352
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:34,199
exciting stuff happens I would argue

2353
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:37,139
okay next week uh this is what I will

2354
01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:38,699
try to discuss

2355
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:42,000
um so today my main claim is history

2356
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,100
matters so the history of urban studies

2357
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,199
that I just discussed shapes also

2358
01:39:46,199 --> 01:39:47,699
current research debates on Urban

2359
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:50,699
cultures and the four strands I will try

2360
01:39:50,699 --> 01:39:52,860
to discuss with you next week uh

2361
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,960
certainly so it is more but I do think

2362
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,600
that this is a pretty exhaustive at the

2363
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,900
same time are one on the Arts activism

2364
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,520
and urban engagement

2365
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,739
this wants to add the second one

2366
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:06,239
specifically focusing on cultural

2367
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:08,460
infrastructures and informal urbanism

2368
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:10,080
probably a bit more on the cultural

2369
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,719
infrastructure site in the informal side

2370
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:14,280
a third one on Urban tourism and

2371
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,840
consumption cultures

2372
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,880
and a fourth one

2373
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:20,280
which links most closely to the

2374
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,020
methodological concerns perhaps it also

2375
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:23,820
is empirical at the same time

2376
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,920
focusing on sensory urbanism so

2377
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,659
different kinds of let's say engaging

2378
01:40:27,659 --> 01:40:30,000
with the urban beyond the visual and and

2379
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,780
text uh again there's only so much I can

2380
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:35,280
do in the two hours that I have next

2381
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,780
