4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,899
can hear me

5
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,820
we're starting in four minutes but I

6
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,980
still would like to make sure that

7
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,020
everything is working here so if you're

8
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,000
not hearing me let me

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
know in the chat or over here but I

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,780
think

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,600
seems to be working

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
foreign

13
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,019
just to check can you all hear me and

14
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,420
see me

15
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,099
um it's a funny question to us these

16
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,120
days but

17
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,220
yes we can great very good thank you

fantastic I'm happy that we not running

19
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,200
into technical troubles right away

20
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,220
um let's start with five past to uh to

21
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,680

at this time of the day and uh

26
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,540
and let's try to make this as pleasant

27
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,720
and experience as possible so five more

28
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,820
minutes I'm gonna switch up the video

29
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,300
for a moment and join you then

30
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,680
foreign

31
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,940
oh yeah please tell us or tell me in the

32
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,020
chat

33
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,620
um which I have open here just in case

34
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,020
welcome all of you

35
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,000
um I'm sure that you've had that so many

36
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,099
times already I really wish we could

37
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,380
meet face to face in a in an actual

38
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,840
lecture room at Pub

39
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,240
um but uh I'm still happy that we're

40
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,220
doing it in any case in this very

41
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,560
unusual or maybe for you actually

42
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,680
already a very normal format by now who

43
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,699
am I you might be wondering my name is

44
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,440
I am a postdoctoral researcher here at

45
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,240
vub

46
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,699
and I'm the last of the four white males

47
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,500
to tell you everything about urban

48
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,639
geography so uh I come last but I hope

49
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,160
um this was not been a very tiring

50
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,479
course by now and you still have the

51
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,500
energy and then will to to follow

52
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,740
um over the course of the next two

53
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,840
lectures two sessions I will be sharing

54
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,860
with you my perspective my ideas about

55
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,800
Urban transport and Mobility

56
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,440
um well it's a lecture so it's very

57
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,900
difficult to make it highly interactive

58
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,520
but I will still try to ask you some

59
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,080
questions and

60
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,958
um I think I hope it's possible for you

61
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,200
to try to respond to them not only

62
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
through chat but basically you know turn

63
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,580
the audio on video and

64
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,659
um I don't think it will be a

65
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,219
conversation but at least it would be

66
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,779
nice to hear some other voices not only

67
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,060
mine for two hours and then two hours

68
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,580
again and of course this is followed by

69
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,100
a discussion seminar so you will have

70
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,600
read or you have read already some

71
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,880
articles and I hope we will have a

72
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,440
discussion there

73
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,360
um so that we we can make this whole

74
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,240
thing a little bit more interactive than

75
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,459
um then it is usually the case through

76
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,760
these uh online online courses

77
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,260
right

78
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,120
um I hope you can also see the slides

79
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,040
can you not those of you who have the

80
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,300
video on

81
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,540
do you see them perfect very good so

82
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,360
um excellent so Urban transported

83
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,700
Mobility it is uh if you have any

84
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,920
questions concerning the content or I

85
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,959
don't know the quality of uh video audio

86
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,019
let me know in the chat I'll try to read

87
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,320
this as I as I talk

88
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,440
multitasking and try to interrupt me if

89
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,300
you yeah if you have any you know

90
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,760
questions if you disagree if you if you

91
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
have some burning issue let me know or

92
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,500
let us know and then I'll try to stop

93
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,680
and address that all right great so what

94
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,380
is the plan for the next two sessions

95
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,600
today we're going to talk about a

96
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
historical hegemony of two different

97
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,279
main sets of approaches to Urban

98
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,220
Geography of transport and next week

99
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,080
we're going to try to deconstruct all

100
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,760
that to address this in a critical

101
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,399
manner and to understand how to look at

102
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
Urban transport immobility from a

103
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,660
critical set of perspectives

104
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,540
so without further Ado today we're going

105
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,060
to start with a bit of a historical

106
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,680
overview of the relationship between

107
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,080
transport and the city uh how this

108
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,120
relationship evolved in

109
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,339
these two directions

110
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,260
and discuss as much as possible as much

111
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,260
as time will allow us to this historical

112
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,600
hegemony of two main sets of approaches

113
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,300
on Urban transport and geography so

114
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,980
neoclassical and sustainable

115
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,100
perspectives of urban transport

116
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
but before we begin

117
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,779
um I'm really curious about what your

118
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,600
expectations might be I imagine that a

119
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,940
lot of you when you know starting a

120
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,100
course of urban studies or geography

121
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,800
didn't really expect to study transport

122
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,700
why would the transport be important for

123
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,959
understanding cities and their geography

124
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,420
what do you think would any like anybody

125
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,600
like to say something or type it in the

126
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,820
chat that's the moment we're going to

127
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,320
have a few of these open questions

128
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,779
throughout these four hours together

129
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,760
why study transport when studying cities

130
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,380
why why is that important or not

131
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,779
um I I did actually expect transport to

132
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,600
be part of the the study because to me

133
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,560
at least

134
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,779
um it Alters the way the city is

135
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,160
structured sometimes it's structured

136
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,279
around a specific mode of Transport

137
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,860
um like there's differences between

138
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,060
um

139
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,040
um what they call like Harbor cities or

140
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,839
cities more in the middle of land

141
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,459
something and I think it makes a big

142
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,220
difference with how with a geographic

143
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,579
development so to me it's actually I

144
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,820
think it's it's a key factor right so it

145
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,959
would have some impact on the urban

146
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,899
Forum on on so it's spatial arrangement

147
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,000
of the city why else

148
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,680
there are many reasons as you can

149
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,060
imagine but what comes to your mind

150
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,940
I think it also like Matilda already

151
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,300
mentioned before uh one main aspect is

152
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,459
sustainability and cities how to like uh

153
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,899
to to reach the climate goals so okay

154
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,519
it's yeah linked to different

155
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,820
transportation systems or so to think of

156
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,640
let's say environmental impact of of

157
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,620
cities and transport being a big part of

158
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,180
that

159
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,260
um possibly or being part of the the

160
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,800
problem right so generating emissions

161
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,800
CO2 and other gases that yeah

162
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,019
contribute to the climate crisis all

163
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,420
right what else

164
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,060
I think something has to do with job

165
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,720
opportunities

166
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,760
for example in Lagos in Nigeria

167
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,720
we see people moving for hours

168
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,200
um go to town to to look for a job and

169
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,180
go back again so eight hours they're

170
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,420
spending in in casual right right so

171
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,700
transport is well without transport it's

172
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,339
difficult to get around the city and and

173
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,060
use its different functions and uh

174
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,380
use different opportunities that the

175
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,240
city might provide like employment

176
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,019
education Leisure many other things all

177
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:25,820
right

178
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,040
any last point before we move on does

179
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,260
somebody have a great idea to add this

180
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,920
little discussion

181
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,399
well okay well I think today yes it's

182
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,079
quite

183
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,120
um actually is this slide a little bit

184
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,980
cut or do you see it yeah I think this

185
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,440
will be better now so today when you

186
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,779
open the news I think it's difficult to

187
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,360
not to notice that transport is well

188
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,940
very present I would say in the in the

189
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,360
public debate last year I'm just taking

190
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,279
a few examples here last year you

191
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,600
probably

192
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,700
um read about or maybe even participated

193
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,680
in a witnessed huge protests that

194
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,019
erupted in Chile studying in the capital

195
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,839
of the country which of course

196
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,360
very much addressed uh

197
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,399
um fundamental structural issues in

198
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,800
terms of how capitalism develops in this

199
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,380
in this country and how it has its Urban

200
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,139
or spatial impact but the beginning of

201
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,240
the protest was so the final you know

202
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,459
dropped that actually led to the

203
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,800
eruption of those and all those strikes

204
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,779
in these uprisings was the increase of

205
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,600
public transport first and specifically

206
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,160
the underground phase

207
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,920
in Brussels that's the top right corner

208
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,440
we've in the past years we've witnessed

209
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,940
a series of protests in public space

210
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,279
that address uh the increased presence

211
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,920
of the car which supposedly these

212
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,740
protests claim takes space from the from

213
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,540
the people so decrease the quality of

214
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,339
our life

215
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,180
um negatively impact the the quality of

216
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,279
um quality of every living health

217
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,279
conditions especially of of children and

218
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,620
then the figure in the top left I'm sure

219
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,240
that you all know Greta

220
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,420
uh who refers to transport of course she

221
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,740
doesn't talk only about the transport

222
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,600
boy when she does when she makes this

223
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,459
very political statement of not

224
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,320
traveling by plane and using only trains

225
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,399
to go to her meetings or or

226
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,260
conferences at least before copied she

227
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,139
did the idea there is to to show us that

228
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,240
there isn't a necessity for us to engage

229
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,220
in some social and environmental

230
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,860
transition and transport is part of this

231
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,720
transition so the way that we've moved

232
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,760
around the way that we've lived is

233
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,440
essentially unsustainable it's

234
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,940
detrimental from the environmental point

235
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,880
of view we need to change that radically

236
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,899
uh meaning in a very drastic way so

237
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,279
really

238
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,420
um

239
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,639
in a very profound way but also in terms

240
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,560
of speed of that change in order to

241
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,420
address what shared and devices the main

242
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,980
issue today the main problem today which

243
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,899
is the climate crisis or the climate

244
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,300
catastrophe that is that is imminent

245
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,579
it's I think easy to yeah just by

246
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,380
following the news to realize that well

247
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,060
something is profoundly wrong with with

248
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,920
uh with the way that we are Mobile today

249
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,639
and that has to change and indeed the

250
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,699
industry or those who are the the key

251
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,320
actors in terms of producing transport

252
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,860
is there to of course respond with some

253
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,899
solutions at least so we're being told

254
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,699
that at least one of the solutions or

255
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,260
one of the series of solutions that are

256
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,880
that are available are those of

257
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,800
platform-based economies of shared

258
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,459
digitalized smart Giga economy related

259
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,880
Mobility or mobilities so we for

260
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,180
instance in the future uh living in the

261
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,579
city we don't have to have a car as we

262
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,320
know detrimental to human environment we

263
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,199
can rent one through an app we can drive

264
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,759
electric cars which are readily

265
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,259
available in public space in our cities

266
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,880
we can use one of these electric

267
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,980
scooters and many other modes of

268
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,500
Transport that have boomed in recent

269
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,779
years in in many many cities of the

270
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,459
flogo north especially but also Global

271
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,220
South and Brussels uh I'm sure those of

272
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,199
you who are from the city who have been

273
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,119
there for a couple of months now

274
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,280
you know you can observe many of these

275
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,439
different practices of Mobility very

276
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
present in the city and some of them at

277
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,919
least

278
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,679
um being part of a narrative of of some

279
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,660
change of some future of something that

280
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,880
is shaping the way that we that we live

281
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,459
and move around the city

282
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,880
from a more scientific perspective one

283
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,340
answer why to the question why study

284
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,039
transport is that quite simply and this

285
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,720
is I think actually the very first

286
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,299
sentence of one of the most seminal uh

287
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,280
textbooks on German of Transport

288
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,559
geography there wouldn't be no

289
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,940
Transportation without geography and

290
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,260
there will be no Transportation no

291
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,660
church free without transportation and

292
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,240
transport of Transportation in North

293
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,500
America

294
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,179
um is an essentially geographical issue

295
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,700
the idea is and again it's the same

296
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,340
textbook the transport allows to reduce

297
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,080
the distance to zero of course that

298
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,120
reduction never really happens but the

299
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,039
idea is the transport allows to

300
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,320
manipulate space and time that is

301
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,740
required to to conquer to cover that

302
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,120
space

303
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,480
and I think beyond that very dry

304
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,520
definition of the relationship between

305
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,400
the two what's quite important is that

306
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,919
well it's very hard to imagine not only

307
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,620
contemporary but also

308
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,760
pre-modern ancient societies without

309
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,280
movement without without transport it's

310
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,539
it's something that has always been

311
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,520
fundamental for for human societies for

312
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,160
human settlements and today and that's

313
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,600
something that I will try to show you in

314
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,580
these two two lectures and in the

315
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,260
discussion that will follow the week

316
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,220
after

317
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,260
transport is absolutely fundamental for

318
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,760
for studying the city and I think it's a

319
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,039
fascinating entry for for studying what

320
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,919
cities are today with problems might be

321
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,960
found in the not only transport problems

322
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,520
but social problems facial problems

323
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,440
economic problems related to all

324
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,080
different challenges that at first at

325
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,120
least do not seem to be transport

326
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,460
related but in fact they are being

327
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,120
negotiated articulated contested soft

328
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,100
sometimes but more often unfortunately

329
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,440
created through transport through the

330
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,020
production and distribution of of

331
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,580
transport

332
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,320
so we will try to unpack this

333
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
relationship starting by uh let's say

334
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,880
more of a historical analysis so I'll

335
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,160
start in mid 19th century in cities in

336
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,740
western Europe uh in what we can

337
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,559
identify as a pre-industrial era

338
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,299
and we will bring that analysis to the

339
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:35,039
1960s 1970s let's see how much time

340
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,000
we've got uh for this today too uh well

341
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,100
let's say the beginning a major crisis

342
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,299
that formed or framed the debate in a

343
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,520
way that it is Being Framed still today

344
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,380
so some kind of a setting of a

345
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,559
contemporary challenge or series of

346
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,179
contemporary charity challenges related

347
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,280
to to transport and Mobility

348
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,559
all right

349
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,220
so

350
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,460
um

351
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,679
the main point here I don't want to

352
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,120
spend too much time on this historical

353
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,679
part because I don't think this is the

354
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,200
well it's it's not contemporary so

355
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,720
perhaps it's not as interesting as many

356
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,000
challenges that are happening right now

357
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,980
the main point here is that Urban

358
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,320
Transport Systems are are very strongly

359
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,299
and strictly related with Urban form and

360
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,280
with a spatial structure so the

361
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,840
development of cities is conditioned by

362
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,039
the development of what we call

363
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,400
transport modes from walking so just

364
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,860
walking on foot to the bicycle to public

365
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,100
transport and and to the car

366
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,720
and there is a persistently strong

367
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,820
relationship between the intra-urban

368
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,960
transportation system and the

369
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,640
organization of the Metropolis as

370
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,860
Mueller who wrote one of the most

371
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,860
seminal again textbooks on on the

372
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,960
history of Transport geography tells us

373
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,039
and there is a variety of different

374
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,080
Urban forms and spiritual structures and

375
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,820
land use patents which are related

376
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,880
specifically or very closely to the

377
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,980
development of different transport laws

378
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,559
and as far as I understand you've

379
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,720
covered quite a few of the most

380
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,080
important models of development Urban

381
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,880
Development throughout history with with

382
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,400
Nick you can not hear if that's the case

383
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,660
and or deny the fact that if you if you

384
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,400
didn't but I think that this was this

385
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,380
was covered at some point and the idea

386
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,919
here is that and a lot of these models

387
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,059
although not explicitly mentioned

388
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,559
transport was actually absolutely

389
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,740
crucial so the idea was both purchase

390
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,900
and announcer movement Mills mentioned

391
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,280
that without the development of

392
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,620
different ways of moving around the city

393
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,380
um the development which of course to an

394
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,299
extent erroneously they try to model or

395
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:44,179
predict would not be able to to happen

396
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,600
um well the debate has been there in the

397
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,120
in the in transport geography until the

398
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,260
1970s 1980s how to how to model that

399
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,720
relationship how to analyze it and

400
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,600
whether in fact it's it's more the

401
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,520
development of the city that drives the

402
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,900
development of transport of the other

403
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,280
Iran whether it's the development of

404
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,320
different transport modes that drive the

405
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,539
development of the city it's not a

406
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:10,620
particularly interesting debate today

407
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,419
but it's important to acknowledge that

408
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,880
geographers were very early on Urban

409
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
geographers interested in the

410
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,360
development of Mobility

411
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,600
one also rather imperfect and symbolic

412
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,880
rather than you know analytical way of

413
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,340
describing this is through identifying

414
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,200
some cycles of innovation so looking at

415
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,340
different

416
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,700
um scientific developments uh come uh

417
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,159
well some scientists would say in in

418
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,980
these kind of crucial moments and

419
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,120
there's a bundle of different

420
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,159
Innovations coming together so at the

421
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,200
end of the 19 18th century as you can

422
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,059
see at the left-hand side of the graph

423
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,299
and the invention of water power

424
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,299
textiles iron then some 60 70 years

425
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,940
later the steam engine rail production

426
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,720
of Steel etc etc each of these bundle of

427
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,000
Innovations allowing you to of course

428
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,820
create a more efficient that usually

429
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,860
meant faster and more energy efficient

430
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,799
way of moving uh of course not only

431
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,440
within but also between cities changing

432
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,299
not only the way that people move but

433
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,360
also the way that the city itself could

434
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,380
be could be organized in in space and in

435
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,539
this sense we could although of course

436
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,880
this is not a perfect you know robust

437
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,919
typology but we could

438
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,500
come into some kind of agreement you

439
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,360
don't have to accept it and I'm happy if

440
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,220
you if you raise some some issues with

441
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,440
it but we could divide the development

442
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,179
of the city around the development of

443
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,059
Transport by identifying four different

444
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,919
let's say stages I wouldn't call them

445
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,780
errors but a city that is a

446
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,880
pre-industrial city that largely was

447
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
based on walking uh since

448
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,640
um motorized transport was uh was

449
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,380
generally speaking not uh well it was

450
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,480
just not there and having a horse would

451
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,700
be an extremely expensive investment so

452
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,440
basically most people walked an

453
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,720
industrial city which uh developed

454
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,860
around

455
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,500
um the birth of what we could identify

456
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,980
today as public transport first horse

457
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,200
driven carts and then motorized ones

458
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,440
then the fordest city which very much

459
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,880
developed around the not only the

460
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,860
invention but rather domestification and

461
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,960
the panelization of of private vehicles

462
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,480
or private cars and then a city of today

463
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,980
the post Forest City which uh very much

464
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,940
Builds on the development of Transport

465
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,820
modes that use the ICT information and

466
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,919
information and communication

467
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,059
Technologies

468
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,220
and of course

469
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,159
um Aviation so the city does is very

470
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,080
much related also to the development of

471
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,299
of all the typology of spaces related to

472
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:46,500
to Flying to airplanes both passenger

473
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,620
and and cargo transport

474
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,179
are there any questions at this stage

475
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,100
before we dive into

476
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,860
these different four stages

477
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,520
I don't hear any yeah yeah go ahead

478
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,350
um

479
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,720
[Music]

480
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,820
it's linked to conductive

481
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,020
um because we saw something like that

482
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,000
with lessons of Nick

483
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,640
yeah I would say so I I think that it's

484
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,179
one of it's one of the ways of um

485
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,340
I wouldn't say that it's specific yeah

486
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,200
that it completely matches conductance

487
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,299
ways but the idea is the same uh that

488
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,520
there is some kind of development of uh

489
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,140
of innovation within the capitalist

490
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,240
system which allows to gain some

491
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,679
competitive Advantage which device

492
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,039
allows to create uh some kind of growth

493
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,659
machine and then this competitive

494
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,779
advantage over time is is uh is lost so

495
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,240
that we have a decline until it picks up

496
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,880
again what I think with chondratic is

497
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,980
still not clear is whether this new wave

498
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,779
so the one that here in this graph

499
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,480
happens after the 1990s it's very clear

500
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,760
so as far as I understand although I'm

501
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,559
not a specialist here there is a

502
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,720
discussion whether this new wave is with

503
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,299
the digitalization and software

504
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,220
engineering is actually materializing or

505
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,799
whether we've arrived at a global system

506
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,179
in which there is uh no growth of

507
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,100
um well at least within industrial

508
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,500
production it's rather a financial or

509
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,559
financialized growth

510
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,080
um but it's it's a good

511
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,360
um let's say it's a good hunch it's the

512
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,740
idea is more or less the same it's the

513
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,500
same intuition

514
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
also the problem with this clearly is

515
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,539
that it's not uh I mean this kind of way

516
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,400
of trying to understand what happened in

517
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,500
cities around transport in the past two

518
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,380
centuries is extremely Western uh

519
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,919
focused or very eurocentric

520
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,200
so so this would not be a story of of

521
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,100
cities in most of Latin America Africa

522
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,940
south Asia and also uh post Soviet or

523
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,580
Soviet world right so the global South

524
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,679
and the global east as it's sometimes

525
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,020
even called today it's not really part

526
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,159
of this

527
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,919
um well the story that is told by this

528
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,000
graph

529
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,580
um we will try to address this but um

530
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,880
it's yeah it's um that will happen at

531
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,440
the very end of the last of the last

532
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,840
session to try to decolonize a little

533
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,100
bit our knowledge about transport

534
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,480
geography because it's extremely

535
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,260
westernized and extremely eurocentric

536
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,740
right let's let's dive into that

537
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,880
um

538
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,020
right so the pre-industrial city right

539
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,260
um well I guess it's quite uh

540
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,100
self-explanatory it's not very difficult

541
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,080
to understand I mean the the idea is

542
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,940
that the city basically is

543
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,159
um well since there is no motorized

544
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,840
transport modes and

545
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,760
um having as I mentioned having a horse

546
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,039
or a horse car it's an it's a cost it's

547
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,440
a fortune it's an absolutely uh

548
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,380
luxurious good

549
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,240
pretty much everybody walks and since

550
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,360
everybody walks uh the city could not be

551
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,400
um cannot be too big for people to cross

552
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,059
it on foot with within more than 20 30

553
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,320
maybe 40 minutes so a traditional

554
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,059
Global northern European city would have

555
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,919
until

556
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,679
let's say end of the 18th century no

557
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,659
more than five kilometers in diameter

558
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,020
and that would mean of course here for

559
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,700
example you have a map of Brussels from

560
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,400
from that time that will mean that

561
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,620
within the city walls which existed for

562
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,960
for military purposes for defense

563
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,840
you know how to be a very high density

564
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,460
of of different functions of different

565
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,260
users

566
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,320
um and uh for other reasons that we're

567
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,179
not going to dive into today the great

568
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,520
Street pattern was also very common from

569
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,340
Middle Ages onwards also very

570
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,620
importantly since these well not maybe

571
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,480
since but as these different functions

572
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,880
were were mixed

573
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,799
um maybe this mixed city was allowed

574
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,419
partially also because of the fact that

575
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,159
the division between work at home a

576
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,440
division that is absolutely fundamental

577
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,419
for a lot of writing on transport

578
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,659
geography that focuses on that morning

579
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,120
and evening commute from home to work

580
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,919
and work from home that did not exist

581
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,740
most people worked from home most people

582
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,840
did not have to move

583
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,559
um to to reach we can say they employ

584
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,179
for the employment that they had or to

585
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:16,200
engage in some kind of productive

586
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,440
activity that would be renumerated to to

587
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,179
um gain some kind of salary or profit

588
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,880
things and this is all Brussels first

589
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,179
Brussels uh the map of it and then uh a

590
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,919
view of the of the city center where you

591
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,140
obviously well you basically see a lot

592
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,179
of pedestrians and uh not much else in

593
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,700
terms of in terms of Mobility modes this

594
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,159
began to change with a series of

595
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,980
inventions first a steam engine an

596
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,020
electric engine in both

597
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,799
um

598
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,020
well the invention started at the end of

599
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,840
18th century and and moved also to the

600
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,480
19th century then the bicycle

601
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,820
um I'm moving very fast here in time

602
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,960
when bicycle was invented in the

603
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,179
60s of the 19th century I think 1867

604
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,559
more or less

605
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,360
of course all these inventions first

606
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,419
being on Curiosities and again very

607
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,940
luxurious Goods bicycle being something

608
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,860
that was much more used for us as a form

609
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,200
of pleasure before eventually becoming a

610
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,340
mode of Transport for for many workers

611
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,020
all that it meant is that they gradually

612
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,940
uh led to mechanization of of land

613
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,340
Transport Systems

614
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,899
and

615
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:35,419
we see that gradually happening here so

616
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,039
these different inventions particularly

617
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,880
steam engine and nature also the

618
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,620
discovery and then Discovery information

619
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,220
that allow to produce electricity uh

620
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,039
meant that uh towards the end of the

621
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,899
19th century appears a completely

622
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,340
different amount of Transport which

623
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,679
revolutionized uh cities of the time

624
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,260
which is that of first a host drone

625
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,880
streetcar and then an electric street

626
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,240
car which started to be introduced in

627
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,700
European Western European cities around

628
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,820
1890s and then became extremely Popular

629
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,080
by the 1920s

630
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:15,659
that led to well we moved to this second

631
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,399
state let's say to the industrial city

632
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:20,460
led to a huge revolution of of how

633
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,340
cities could be conquered by its by its

634
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,840
inhabitants how they could be managed

635
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,940
navigated by by its inhabitants

636
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:30,539
um

637
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,659
that also allowed or led to the decision

638
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,580
to to engage in construction of a number

639
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,100
of underground uh tramways as they were

640
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,600
first called The Underground systems

641
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,460
first

642
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,460
uh in London and 18 as early as 1863

643
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,460
then Budapest in 1896 and the First

644
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,559
Northern American system in Boston in

645
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,200
1897.

646
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,360
and that that marked the beginning of of

647
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,059
as I said a revolutionary change in a

648
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,980
golden era of the development of Railway

649
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,980
Transport Systems as Railway networks

650
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,840
expanded tremendously and became the

651
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,220
dominant land transport for both

652
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,460
passengers and for Freight and that was

653
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,580
valid or is valid for both inter-urban

654
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,640
and intra intra-urban transport

655
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,620
why was this invention revolutionary

656
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,360
well of course because

657
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,399
increased speed allowed to cover

658
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,500
increased distance so suddenly the for

659
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,320
instance the idea of of still living

660
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,480
within the very medieval perimeter of

661
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,200
the city uh was or started to be to be

662
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,120
questioned the idea of expanding the

663
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,740
city to the suburb or connecting the

664
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,919
villages and the suburbs to the to the

665
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,620
city proper began to to make a lot of

666
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,779
sense so that led

667
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:43,500
um

668
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,200
was one at least one of the ideas why in

669
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,600
a number of uh cities across Europe City

670
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,059
walls where um were demolished

671
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,399
see that here in in Brussels so first uh

672
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,320
horse drawn card I think it's a

673
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,960
photograph from the 1890s

674
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,799
so end of the 19th century and

675
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,600
1910 uh I think it's a great Royal in

676
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,840
Brussels you already see and uh no I

677
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,559
think that's is that a horse

678
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,360
I think it actually is already it's an

679
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,620
electric one although I don't see the

680
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,120
cables I thought it was an electric but

681
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,220
I think it might still be

682
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,779
um pulled by a horse although you don't

683
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,779
see that from uh well the drum that is

684
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,279
heading in our direction does not have a

685
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,419
have a horse pulling it

686
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:33,539
right so

687
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,940
I already mentioned this in a little bit

688
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,779
so a revolution in urban travel a

689
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:43,380
breaking uh mode that's allowed to

690
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,600
um to rethink the air before made an

691
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,600
impact on it in a great way breaking

692
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,480
this idea of a compact dense medieval

693
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,480
city allowing to extend what we what was

694
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,059
considered to be a city to up to 20 or

695
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:58,679
30 kilometers in Diamond if you think

696
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,240
that the previous

697
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,820
um let's say model of a city had up to

698
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,820
five This was um

699
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,780
an expansion of four to six six times

700
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,379
what also appears in in this process uh

701
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:14,699
of course it's not all related to

702
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,080
transport but it's happening at more or

703
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,359
less the same time and it makes a big

704
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,879
impact on on what transport is in the

705
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,879
city and what a role is is that this

706
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,560
expansion of the urban form in space

707
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,480
allows for some specialization of

708
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,159
different functions especially economic

709
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,219
functions and what it also creates or

710
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,199
contributes to the creation of is the

711
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,599
creation of a working class of of a

712
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,480
specific group a social group of course

713
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,139
Very diverse internally but a group that

714
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,980
um sells its time for a living that uh

715
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,418
of course with the Industrial Revolution

716
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,760
does that not anymore at home but

717
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,399
actually starts what we start calling

718
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,040
commuting to its uh to its workplace

719
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,040
where

720
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,320
things are being produced what profit is

721
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,119
being made and where their salary

722
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,260
workers is exchanged uh for uh for money

723
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,240
for a salary

724
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,040
um that separation as I mentioned being

725
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,220
absolutely fundamental for decades of of

726
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,859
analysis of transport to to come so

727
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,500
focus on this commute from from work to

728
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,500
home and vice versa

729
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,680
moving to the next some technical issues

730
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,740
here moving to the next uh stage of

731
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,839
Urban Development we can put it very

732
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,020
very roughly of course a fundamental

733
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,359
invention of of the car not only the

734
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:38,820
invention of the car proper because the

735
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,760
well the vehicle itself I mean we can go

736
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,040
back to the first the diesel engine

737
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,500
invented in the 90s of the 19th century

738
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,480
pneumatic tire four-stroke engine

739
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,780
invented a few years later and that led

740
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,820
to the construction of the first

741
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,380
automobiles as they were called back

742
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,260
then in 1890s

743
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,660
um but it was fundamentally the

744
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,640
massification of of the current the

745
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,220
invention of this particular model uh

746
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,780
which I'm sure you've

747
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,460
or a lot of you probably have heard

748
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,099
about already the Model T by Ford uh

749
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,980
which began to be produced in 1913 and

750
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,980
famously Mr Ford said that this model is

751
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,380
available in any color as long as it is

752
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,780
black the idea being that with

753
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,720
unification of

754
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,460
universalization of the model uh getting

755
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,180
rid of any options of any customization

756
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,240
of any personalization

757
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,240
um and also the implementation of today

758
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,339
is being called taylorism so reaching a

759
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:43,440
near automated way of producing this

760
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,660
this vehicle with very strictly measured

761
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,380
time for every single activity that

762
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,640
that was part of the production process

763
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,400
the final price of the production and

764
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,320
the final price for the consumer could

765
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,240
be reduced as much as possible meaning

766
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,240
that this product this commodity could

767
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,900
be available to to White masses and that

768
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,500
does begin uh from the 1910s already but

769
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,380
especially from the 1930s uh when indeed

770
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,540
the price started going significantly

771
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,300
down the era of of the automobile the

772
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,359
era of a mode which I'm sure that if you

773
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,280
you know turn on the news about Brussels

774
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,140
or any other Western European North

775
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,680
American city uh by that debate also uh

776
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,599
is very very present in many African

777
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,540
Latin American South Asian cities

778
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,940
um it's a mode that is very much on the

779
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,980
agenda whenever you talk about whenever

780
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,140
you hear about transport

781
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,660
and we're going to talk about that I

782
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,520
guess tonight if not in a week as a very

783
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,020
uh well as a very present mode of

784
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,460
Transport in our cities and also very

785
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,839
problematic mode of Transport that

786
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,940
attracts a lot of condensation a lot of

787
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,020
uh

788
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,359
um a lot of anger and a lot of

789
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,280
um creative and critical thinking in

790
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,660
terms of what's the alternative to the

791
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,040
to the automobile

792
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,020
so it's been almost a century now that

793
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,480
our cities if we think about it from the

794
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,000
global North uh I don't know benefiting

795
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,040
or suffering from that from that no you

796
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,599
tell me

797
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,380
um

798
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,940
famously from 1913 to 1927 Ford managed

799
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,520
to build 15 million units 15 million

800
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,560
Vehicles making it the second most

801
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,240
produced car in history right after

802
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,220
Volkswagen Beetle

803
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,740
um which was also they began the

804
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,240
production a little bit later but also

805
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,220
in the period between the first and

806
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,800
second World War

807
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,800
so why uh well this we've covered

808
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,859
already mostly but well the most

809
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,780
important thing here is in the last

810
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,140
bullet points I mean why is the car such

811
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,640
a revolutionary and such an important

812
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,380
mode of transports to be to be mentioned

813
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,300
here is that for the very first time

814
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,160
Mobility

815
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,440
um modernized Mobility is an individual

816
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,920
exercise it's no longer only a motorized

817
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,440
or a horse horse-drone streetcar that

818
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,200
allows you to cover long distances of

819
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,720
taking a train a Suburban train that

820
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,220
takes you to the factory and back but

821
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,740
it's an it is an individual vehicle an

822
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,420
individual product that allows you to

823
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,540
reach unprecedented levels of of

824
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,460
individual Mobility

825
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,599
and of course that uh immediately uh had

826
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,300
a very important impact on on the way

827
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,859
that the cities are planned and and

828
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:25,859
imagined

829
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,320
um

830
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,079
well

831
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,900
without running the risk of uh or maybe

832
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,060
a little bit of you know drawing some

833
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,060
kind of caricature this impact

834
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,980
um starting from especially the second

835
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,520
world war when when it was a very strong

836
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,619
Narrative of the need of modernizing

837
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:48,240
um cities especially in North America

838
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,160
and Western Europe

839
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,940
a lot of cities be became basically

840
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,320
um

841
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,780
well perfect space for for for for

842
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,200
driving around a space in which huge

843
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,780
amounts of infrastructure for this

844
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,119
individual car based Mobility was built

845
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,220
this process started a little bit early

846
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,980
in the US and the 1940s and 50s already

847
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,260
and after the second world war

848
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,060
um that narrative was started to be very

849
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,460
present in in Western European as 50

850
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,260
both of these images by the way come

851
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,200
from a really wonderful film by uh

852
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,060
Jacques tatti I believe it's called

853
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,579
playtime from the 1967 which I really

854
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:27,900
recommend you watch it's a great

855
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,599
critique of this idea of this training

856
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,180
of modernity which also very much hinges

857
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,480
on on the idea of having a car of um

858
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,240
of driving around

859
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,900
um and well moving to more serious stuff

860
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,480
I mean accommodating the current city

861
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,240
meant that

862
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,619
serious infrastructure had to be built

863
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,960
uh series have had to happen in in

864
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,140
cities at the time for for the car to

865
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,720
receive this kind of space

866
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,500
um

867
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,839
some of the most important projects

868
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:02,579
happen in the US as I mentioned on the

869
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,020
on the left hand side you've got the

870
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,480
Franklin Delano Roosevelt drive and

871
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,240
opened in 1966 in New York on the right

872
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,820
hand side the infamous Ponte Morandi in

873
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,859
in Genoa in Italy 1967 which

874
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,740
unfortunately collapsed I believe two

875
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,280
years ago which also symbolized of

876
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,020
course it's a it's a terrible terrible

877
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,140
event but for for many it was a very

878
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,180
powerful symbol of this infrastructure

879
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,760
crumbling and an important question of

880
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,820
what to do with these relics of

881
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,820
um of modernity or past modernity

882
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,099
whether they should be in this case

883
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:41,220
rebuilt or maintained or invested in

884
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,839
whether this is something that we want

885
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:45,540
to gradually dismantle uh and and stop

886
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,460
subsidizing the maintenance of these

887
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,700
infrastructures is um undoubtedly very

888
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,440
costly

889
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,920
and the next slide uh does anybody have

890
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,380
a clue where this city is

891
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,780
very good well done yes this is the uh

892
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,339
I don't remember the name of the road

893
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,980
but uh yeah yeah it's in the next slide

894
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,800
I'm so silly green belch are nine built

895
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,140
in 90 or opened in 1976. I don't know if

896
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,060
you've ever had the experience of of

897
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,460
driving this but it's really uh it's

898
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,800
uncanny it's it it makes me personally

899
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,099
feel as if I was in some uh Chinese or

900
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,260
other Asian City where you're on this

901
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,200
elevated platform almost gliding through

902
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,119
through the city so it's really one of

903
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,200
the

904
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,540
uh I think most extreme or more extreme

905
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,280
cases at least in this part of of Europe

906
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,660
of

907
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,060
um really plowing through through a city

908
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,140
to build this Motorway uh Ring Road

909
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,380
but chalawa was not the only one I mean

910
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,780
we are after all or I don't know where

911
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,460
you are right now but most of us are in

912
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,020
Brussels right now and Brussels was

913
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,720
definitely also a playground for many of

914
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,180
these many of these ideas and the idea

915
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,740
of bringing the car and opening the city

916
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,880
to the car

917
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,980
like in American cities at least that

918
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,720
was the comparison used in Belgium

919
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,880
became particularly strong and

920
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,099
particularly

921
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,740
um potent among the political class the

922
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,680
decision makers around 1958. what

923
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,560
happened in 1958 I guess you've heard

924
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,480
that date before

925
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,579
any non-belgians

926
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:28,220
1958 why is that important for Brussels

927
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,560
the atomium and why would the atomium be

928
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,680
uh well okay the World Expo symbolized

929
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,000
by the atomium and why would that be

930
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,839
related to the car

931
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,099
um you really don't have any ideas

932
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:50,099
I mean if you opening a World Expo for

933
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,480
the very first time in Belgium and

934
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,220
inviting I don't remember how many

935
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,140
people actually visited the Expo in the

936
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,180
end but millions of people uh visited

937
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,119
the city why why would a car be

938
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,980
important of the car be important in

939
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,520
that regard

940
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,339
so for putting Belgium on the map

941
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,319
yes it's to solve the idea of I mean not

942
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,359
the idea the problem of congestion is to

943
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,280
bring these masses to the Expo and back

944
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,380
is to allow for a better communication

945
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,540
but also to put Belgium on them to show

946
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,700
that Belgium is a modern country to show

947
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,760
that it's it's on you know Cutting Edge

948
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,980
and being Cutting Edge in 1958 and those

949
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,960
who meant opening the city for the car

950
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,800
and

951
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,680
building huge infrastructure or start at

952
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,300
least to build huge infrastructure that

953
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,079
would accommodate this new modern uh us

954
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,579
like

955
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:51,240
um American way of of mobility of moving

956
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,220
around the city

957
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:58,020
uh so yeah uh some things that are quite

958
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,540
quite Unthinkable today uh were going on

959
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,599
at that time so this is Gohan plus uh I

960
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,819
think it's in the 1960s

961
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:08,940
so of course Expo was a symbolic event

962
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,700
it didn't really uh I mean it was it was

963
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,880
not just tipping points there were a lot

964
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,500
of Dynamics happening at that time and

965
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,900
the Expo was maybe a more of a symbolic

966
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,180
moment but it is around the time that

967
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,460
the level of motorization so the level

968
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,920
of ownership of cars in Belgian

969
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,380
households and similar processes are

970
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,640
mentioned in Belgium here but similar

971
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,960
things were going on in France in

972
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,920
Germany

973
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,880
uh in the UK it went through the roof

974
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,880
um so it was

975
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,640
it was very very common back then to uh

976
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,920
to invest in a car as a symbol of of

977
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,960
advancing as a household as a symbol of

978
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,720
social Mobility not only a physical uh

979
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,160
geographical Mobility that of course

980
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,260
meant that more and more space had to be

981
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,240
given to the car and as the car became

982
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,740
more present more people bought the car

983
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,140
so the circle was closed and it was a

984
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,700
vicious one

985
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,400
in Brussels specifically well one of the

986
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,200
most important infrastructures built at

987
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,599
the time is the Petit Center so the Ring

988
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,660
Road that surrounds the Pentagon of the

989
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,520
city I'm sure that you've all have been

990
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,240
there so essentially the

991
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,500
well the the framing of it right the the

992
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,000
actual shape of the Pentagon comes from

993
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,800
the city was the second walls of

994
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,079
Brussels uh coming from the 14th century

995
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,300
uh completely destroyed which defined

996
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,800
the historic center of the city still

997
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,560
and until the 1950s it was a very much

998
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,180
an urban Boulevard in which one could

999
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,520
stroll and and walk very much like in

1000
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,180
the

1001
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,920
drawings rather than photographs that I

1002
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,900
showed you at the beginning from this

1003
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,940
city of walking city that was very much

1004
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,520
defined by by The Pedestrian mode of

1005
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,180
moving around

1006
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,099
um and in relation to the 1958 that had

1007
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,220
to be gradually uh transformed so a

1008
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,980
series of first tunnels were built then

1009
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,859
uh the service was raised to uh to open

1010
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:01,020
to the car it took 20 years of work

1011
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,760
which is not a very unusual thing in

1012
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,740
Brussels uh to do so two decades of

1013
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,900
extremely heavy work uh and very

1014
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,400
destructive work whole neighborhoods

1015
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,680
have to be relocated destroyed to

1016
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,060
rebuilt

1017
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,780
um so opened in 1976 uh with 15 tunnels

1018
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,060
surrounding the city also quite

1019
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,640
importantly and that's maybe a bit of an

1020
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,380
extreme story that not necessarily

1021
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,480
happened also in France or in Germany or

1022
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,460
in other Western European cities but

1023
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,920
what was very crucial in Brussels is

1024
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,020
that the engineering teams or the

1025
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,000
engineering offices consultancy officers

1026
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,460
who would call them today would receive

1027
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,380
a personal bonus on top of their salary

1028
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,480
for every kilo kilometer of an

1029
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,720
underground tunnel built so that led to

1030
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,480
creation of a huge push to build

1031
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,300
underground infrastructure for Mobility

1032
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,119
both for for cars but also for railroad

1033
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,119
and Metro uh and that led to a creation

1034
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:56,099
of very important expertise in building

1035
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:58,260
these underground tunnels uh which of

1036
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,660
course once you have that expertise you

1037
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,400
of course want to keep building more

1038
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,500
because that's what you are very good at

1039
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,500
doing and that problem in Brussels well

1040
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,020
problem of situation exists until today

1041
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,099
where we have huge teams of engineering

1042
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,119
Specialists who specialize in building

1043
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,339
underground it's in steep in the public

1044
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:19,380
transport company in Brussels half of

1045
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,780
the company is responsible for for Metro

1046
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,599
for maintenance and construction so you

1047
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,220
can imagine that what you want to do of

1048
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,260
course is to keep building and Metro

1049
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,000
which is what they are currently doing

1050
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,160
in Brussels

1051
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,200
um moving a little bit or zooming out a

1052
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,960
little bit from cities

1053
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,720
um the large-scale diffusion of of the

1054
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,099
car or the automobile is a mass

1055
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,460
consumption project of course was uh

1056
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,560
strongly also influenced or maybe also

1057
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,440
LED so it's a two-way Dynamic to the

1058
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,260
emergence of first Nationwide Highway

1059
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,260
systems in the first one uh created was

1060
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,540
of course the one in the US the American

1061
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,000
interstate highway system which began to

1062
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,980
be not maybe completely built from

1063
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,880
scratch but the first framing of it and

1064
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,920
continuous gradual addition to the

1065
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,579
network in 1956.

1066
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,700
um which was of course back then uh that

1067
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,859
symbol of modernity that

1068
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,800
um in many many places in Belgium being

1069
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,560
one of them influence the definition of

1070
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,300
the idea of what was Modern what was

1071
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,160
cutting-edge was technologically

1072
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,800
advanced

1073
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,400
today of course uh it's not the us

1074
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,800
anymore that it's the leading uh country

1075
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,420
or the leading power in terms of the

1076
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,220
development of Transport technology and

1077
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,740
and highways in particular uh that

1078
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,140
system that American system has been by

1079
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,319
now surpassed definitely by the one in

1080
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,540
China the national trunk highway system

1081
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,280
here I have a little bit of an old graph

1082
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,540
but by 2011 as far as I can read it well

1083
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,720
but already 2009 the total amount of

1084
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,339
kilometers of motorways in both

1085
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:02,520
countries us and China was equal and the

1086
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,440
one in China of course was Rising still

1087
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,579
very

1088
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:08,880
um very steep but you can see that this

1089
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,640
I don't like the term but let's say the

1090
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,460
catching up or this idea of following a

1091
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,079
little bit in the footsteps of what the

1092
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,119
Americans did in the 1950s in China

1093
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,339
happened in an extremely

1094
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:23,700
um short time which not only because of

1095
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,200
the construction of the motorways but

1096
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,839
this was a very important part of the of

1097
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,900
the construction boom meant that

1098
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,680
um

1099
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,880
from 2006 2007 onwards now the situation

1100
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,200
is a little bit different because of the

1101
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,000
ongoing crisis and also other problems

1102
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,819
the Chinese economy uh suffered from but

1103
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:44,520
the consumption of the the demand for

1104
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,800
concrete in China was bigger than in all

1105
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,760
other countries around the world

1106
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,000
combined so this was really a boom of an

1107
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,540
unprecedented scale and we will see a

1108
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,280
few other graphs and down the lecture

1109
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,660
which

1110
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:01,440
show us that while in many cities many

1111
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,819
countries around what we might be

1112
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,559
thinking that we are moving away from

1113
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,660
the current right now but that's the

1114
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,240
idea that the other parts of the world

1115
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,280
that did not experience this development

1116
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,740
at the same time as Global noise are now

1117
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:18,059
and definitely contributing to um to not

1118
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:19,680
even I would say Persistence of

1119
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,819
automobility but actually it's

1120
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:23,780
continuous rise on the global scale

1121
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,040
what was very important going back to

1122
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,160
the Belgium uh context of the 1950s and

1123
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,400
1960s it's also difficult to say what

1124
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,579
was first the car or the suburbs or the

1125
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:37,260
suburbs and the car but the two were

1126
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,020
extremely uh strongly linked with one

1127
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,839
another having the car

1128
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,720
and as I mentioned as I explained the

1129
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,760
car became a very common popular and

1130
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,579
cheap commodity not only defined how we

1131
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,680
moved to to uh to work and you move

1132
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,420
around the city but actually it's again

1133
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,880
redefined what the city is so suddenly

1134
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,220
areas which would be normally considered

1135
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,460
rural become accessible and become

1136
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,440
interesting for people to to settle in

1137
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,260
the idea also being and that you have

1138
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,680
more space more freedom

1139
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,599
you are close to you are close to Nature

1140
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,780
etc etc these days it might be it might

1141
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,460
feel like it's something of the past

1142
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,700
something that is uh yeah not

1143
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,099
interesting to to many urbanites of

1144
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,740
today day but back then it was

1145
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,720
absolutely the way to the way to go the

1146
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,720
way to live the way to think uh that one

1147
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,680
should invest as a household in

1148
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,579
the home Marketing in property Market

1149
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:39,300
um

1150
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,650
the special

1151
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,020
[Music]

1152
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,900
results of of that of the double Dynamic

1153
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,480
of motorization on the one hand

1154
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,359
suborganization on the other was that if

1155
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,760
a pre-industrial city had more or less

1156
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,599
10 of its space devoted to transport and

1157
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,859
Mobility an industrial a modern city has

1158
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:04,260
between 15 and 30 percent and that's

1159
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,119
rough estimates from Western Europe to

1160
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:08,400
up to 60 percent in in some American

1161
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,420
cities of space will be given to uh to

1162
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,980
Mobility infrastructure which is

1163
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,280
principally uh highways and and parking

1164
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,000
lots which of course uh is a is a huge

1165
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
spatial cost

1166
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,700
and uh well another development of

1167
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,160
course is that uh the commuting area as

1168
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,000
we we start to call it so the the actual

1169
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,079
um

1170
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,240
definition of what a city is regardless

1171
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,040
of administrative limits and different

1172
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,540
boundaries of course this would be often

1173
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,400
divided into some municipalities and all

1174
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,000
it goes up to uh 100 kilometers in

1175
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,460
diameter so suddenly what is a city

1176
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,900
becomes

1177
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,359
um or starts becoming a little bit vague

1178
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,700
in the sense that the old Urban course

1179
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,640
of course do not hold all the functions

1180
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,180
anymore and we start seeing cities

1181
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,760
um expanding in this economic uh

1182
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,760
economic terms

1183
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,760
well

1184
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,540
without running into the risk of of

1185
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,400
simplifying things a little bit too much

1186
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,760
but what happened in a lot of cities

1187
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,200
both in North America and in Western

1188
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,780
Europe is that as the car became more

1189
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,300
and more popular and as moving by car

1190
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,819
became absolutely common

1191
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:28,740
um and if you basically had a middle

1192
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,140
class job and that's that's what you did

1193
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,280
you lived in the suburbs and you

1194
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,660
commuted to the office job by car

1195
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,579
Transit companies or mass transit

1196
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:39,839
companies public transport companies

1197
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,880
started to run into serious financial

1198
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,220
difficulties so

1199
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,319
um traditionally uh when they were

1200
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,260
actually set up in the 19th or end of

1201
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,599
the 19th century 1910s 1920s they would

1202
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,220
be private companies very often private

1203
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,200
arailroads bringing workers to the

1204
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,059
suburbs and dark or bringing the

1205
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:00,300
Bourgeois and people who wanted to enjoy

1206
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,040
Leisure outside of the city and then

1207
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:02,940
back

1208
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,760
as they started to run into trouble in

1209
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,400
some countries and that's usually the

1210
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,599
case in Western Europe they would be

1211
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,099
nationalized they will be taken over by

1212
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,200
the state as an important part of

1213
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,619
military infrastructure but also an

1214
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:17,460
important part of Mobility

1215
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,579
infrastructure and kept but they roll

1216
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:22,260
the societal role would definitely

1217
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,940
decline so it would be it would become

1218
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,339
something not necessarily for the middle

1219
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:28,619
class but rather for the working class

1220
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:31,380
Belgium here is some sort of an

1221
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,319
exception because a lot of commuting

1222
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:35,940
here and due to the fact that the

1223
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,220
railway system was traditionally been

1224
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,680
very dense

1225
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,180
hadn't happened and still is happening

1226
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,920
uh very much through public transport

1227
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,420
but that's definitely not the case in

1228
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,339
the UK for example or definitely not in

1229
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:48,300
North America

1230
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,079
but and sticking to North America

1231
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,020
um in a number of uh cities over there

1232
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,720
the process that happened uh was

1233
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,220
inversed so the decline of public

1234
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,319
transit did not lead to any uh

1235
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:03,119
investment by the state either on the

1236
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,420
federal or the state state level uh but

1237
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,500
rather

1238
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,280
um

1239
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,740
eventually a dismantling of of public

1240
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,579
transport systems happened and a very uh

1241
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,200
particular story is that of the General

1242
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,300
Motors Company so one of the main

1243
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,579
producers of of these Mass Commodities

1244
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,740
the cars

1245
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,140
um who throughout the 1940s basically

1246
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,059
bought a number of public transport

1247
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,740
companies mass transit companies as they

1248
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,780
are called over there and purposely led

1249
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,440
to the decline uh why well the idea was

1250
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,240
quite simple and it was basically to get

1251
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,619
rid of the competitions that public

1252
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:38,760
transport

1253
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,960
um could have

1254
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,240
um could have posed to the to the

1255
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,760
individual Mobility to to the car so the

1256
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,740
idea was to push public transport out of

1257
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,319
the market and again

1258
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:50,359
um

1259
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:53,780
I just saw the comment from somebody

1260
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,359
and and again yes the idea of course was

1261
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,160
that this was also framed by the

1262
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,099
discourse of modernity and and advancing

1263
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:03,839
as a society

1264
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,400
um I forgot to mention but we will be

1265
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,980
taking uh a break in both today and then

1266
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,960
a week uh I don't think that you know

1267
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,520
sticking to the screen for two hours is

1268
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,740
a healthy thing to do so we will take a

1269
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,940
break actually in three minutes probably

1270
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,619
for about five minutes

1271
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:18,660
uh just in case you're getting a little

1272
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,020
bit tight

1273
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:26,640
but this uh total decline or some could

1274
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,140
even say a disaster in terms of what

1275
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,180
happened to mass transport must transits

1276
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,760
or in public transport was not uh always

1277
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,220
the case so as I already mentioned in in

1278
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,319
some countries uh public transport

1279
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,359
networks are actually what being taken

1280
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,040
over by the state and even invested in

1281
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,200
and one important thing that happens or

1282
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,839
you know a symbolic project that

1283
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,700
happened is that of copenhagen's finger

1284
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,819
plant from 1947 uh so basically their

1285
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:52,859
the decision was made to create an

1286
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:55,079
alternative or maybe not a substitute

1287
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:56,940
but an alternative parallel to car

1288
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,520
commuting basically Suburban rail which

1289
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,900
follows the shape of five fingers uh

1290
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,920
corridors that would not only be

1291
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,619
transport corridors but also along which

1292
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,599
a number of different functions

1293
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,480
especially residential but also economic

1294
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,839
work related functions would be

1295
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,900
um placed as well and that was uh as far

1296
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,839
as I know one of the first plans that uh

1297
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,819
tried to achieve what we call transport

1298
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:25,680
oriented development or development

1299
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,440
Urban Development that happens around or

1300
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,480
in this particular case a long transport

1301
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,359
corridors to allow for different

1302
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,180
Mobility options back then maybe

1303
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,260
environmental issues were not so much on

1304
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,760
the agenda but the idea was that people

1305
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,380
would be able to get more efficiently to

1306
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,480
work not only by car but also by

1307
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,599
Suburban rail

1308
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,200
uh in our lovely Brussels well things

1309
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,819
were not so

1310
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,099
not so easy or well things were a little

1311
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:55,380
bit in between so on the one hand the

1312
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,180
car was definitely the king and actually

1313
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,720
it's one of the uh slogans in in

1314
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,880
let's say Brussels centered Academia and

1315
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,400
public debate Carr became the King

1316
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,559
around the 1950s with the Expo of the

1317
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:09,960
1958 and still very much is a very

1318
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,460
present and very privileged mode of

1319
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,839
transport

1320
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:14,460
but public transport of course did not

1321
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,960
disappear and one of the particularities

1322
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,000
of Brussels is that unlike in Charlotte

1323
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,079
for example or many cities in Germany or

1324
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,880
in France especially tramways for

1325
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,799
example were never completely dismantled

1326
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:29,819
and you would see and I can't think of

1327
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:31,380
any specific names right now in France

1328
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,900
but there are cities in which tranway

1329
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,440
network existed uh 1940s 50s and 60s and

1330
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,220
then was completely dismantled to open a

1331
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,859
surface space to the car so what

1332
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:45,660
happened in Brussels is that the Trump

1333
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,480
was basically put underground so you see

1334
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,720
on top left

1335
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,819
which is that magnificent Urban Waterway

1336
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:56,819
these days and you see a tram trying to

1337
00:59:56,819 --> 00:59:58,980
plow its way through the through the

1338
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,740
city standing in a traffic jam the idea

1339
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,200
uh well of course the city is packed the

1340
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,819
space is limited with the rise of

1341
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:08,940
mobility and individual mobility and the

1342
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,040
rise of the number of cars traffic jams

1343
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,200
happen the decision there was May need

1344
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,700
not to make more space for the tram

1345
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,260
would make to make more space for the

1346
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,380
car so strategic decision was to put the

1347
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,559
tram first on the ground creating a very

1348
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,780
particular mode of transports made in

1349
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,940
Brussels called pre-metro premature

1350
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,099
which then eventually

1351
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:31,020
um as it was actually planned was

1352
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,619
converted into into a full-scale as we

1353
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:37,200
call it in Brussels heavy metal look you

1354
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,000
can actually see in pre-metro still and

1355
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,680
that's line three and four in in

1356
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,299
Brussels the tramline that goes from

1357
01:00:42,299 --> 01:00:44,700
north to south of the Pentagon which as

1358
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,140
you probably have heard

1359
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,319
is now well will soon be converted into

1360
01:00:49,319 --> 01:00:51,780
a proper Network once and the new metro

1361
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,839
line from God you know and northwards is

1362
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:56,880
constructed uh so you can for example

1363
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,040
see I don't know if you ever had a

1364
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,260
chance of of uh you know noting that the

1365
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,819
platforms and although this is a trump

1366
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:04,140
stock the platforms are actually much

1367
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,299
much wider than usually would be in the

1368
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:08,520
case of a tram and they are much longer

1369
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,680
basically they were built I think

1370
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,319
already back in the 70s anticipating a

1371
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:16,020
proper Metro we are now in 2020 so

1372
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,000
finally the Metro is is happening

1373
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,740
although well it's a controversial

1374
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,559
project to say the least

1375
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,500
um let's take a little break here not

1376
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,500
longer than five six minutes so grab

1377
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,440
another tea or a coffee and I'll see you

1378
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,839
back in four or five minutes all right

1379
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,400
great

1380
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,420
see you in a moment

1381
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,700
welcome back overview I hope you grabbed

1382
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,980
another drink or whatever it is that you

1383
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,619
are having or grab another notebook to

1384
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:48,180
keep noticing things although of course

1385
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,579
you've got the recording of all this

1386
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:52,319
um and I can see that some people are

1387
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,420
asking questions

1388
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:58,859
um I might also ask you if up to now up

1389
01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:00,480
to now everything has been clear or if

1390
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,160
you've got any questions about what I've

1391
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,500
been talking about if yes please raise

1392
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,660
your hand just speak up but I think it's

1393
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,299
an interesting question that Mika asked

1394
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:12,480
here in the chat with um

1395
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,640
indeed what was happening right now is

1396
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,579
that we have an increased desire for

1397
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:19,980
uh what we could say is a pre-industrial

1398
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,319
city a city of walking of uh short of

1399
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:26,160
distances density of users mixes

1400
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,319
um does anybody have an opinion on this

1401
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:32,900
would you agree would you not agree

1402
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:39,780
or maybe Mika whoever he or she is has

1403
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,099
an opinion

1404
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,420
that's me

1405
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,559
um

1406
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,859
yeah I wasn't sure if it's really linked

1407
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:49,559
to the pre-industrial city but when you

1408
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:51,119
explained

1409
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:52,619
um

1410
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:55,980
how how it was looking how how it looked

1411
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,680
like I thought about like actually it's

1412
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,660
exactly what today's planning is about

1413
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,980
like this

1414
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:05,039
uh mixed use this like

1415
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,059
a narrow uh streets where you yeah with

1416
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:14,220
walkability and short distances and I

1417
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,560
mean maybe it's also really a European

1418
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,339
perspective

1419
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:24,420
maybe it could be like a new role model

1420
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,080
of today's planning does anybody have an

1421
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,420
uh an opinion on this would anybody like

1422
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,900
to react

1423
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:41,520
I can compare with for example in

1424
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,140
interrupt

1425
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:43,720
um I'm living

1426
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,460
[Music]

1427
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,120
um

1428
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,238
in the center of the city and

1429
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:52,439
what we see is uh that the place for

1430
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:55,259
um private cars is reducing for example

1431
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:57,960
they they put parking lots under

1432
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,660
undergrounds for making some some

1433
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,120
leisure activities or Parks or something

1434
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,120
else so we see a movement I guess when

1435
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,179
we focus on that and definitely in

1436
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:12,120
Brussels depending on the policy now

1437
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,779
um it's more ecological

1438
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:18,540
minded and we see more

1439
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,960
um opportunities to to reduce

1440
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,420
parking lots and and more movements like

1441
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,960
for example in unspec land yeah

1442
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,060
um

1443
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:31,679
so this pedestrian area of Brussels yeah

1444
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,960
yeah and we couldn't imagine I guess 20

1445
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,460
years ago so we see different movements

1446
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:39,600
yeah there is definitely some kind of

1447
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,020
shift happening I mean we are not in the

1448
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:45,179
1960s or 70s not where like what is

1449
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:47,580
right now on the slide things have moved

1450
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,380
on the present of the car is definitely

1451
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,540
put on the question but is this about

1452
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,120
going to a free industrial city what

1453
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,500
would be the problem with that or would

1454
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,540
be the risk of

1455
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:00,120
um just reverting to walking let's say

1456
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,160
if that's what the pre-industrial city

1457
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,320
was about

1458
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,320
does anybody have you know an opinion on

1459
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,219
this

1460
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:12,000
there is no wrong answers here

1461
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,860
Vitality is saying that new Mobility

1462
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,960
plans are aiming at the best of use of

1463
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,040
all Technologies we have now with

1464
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,900
maximum inclusivity

1465
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,840
yeah I guess so

1466
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,840
um the proof is in the in the you know

1467
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,120
well depends on how they of course

1468
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,520
implement it and and it's the idea of

1469
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,199
course is that everybody is included and

1470
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,080
we use all the Technologies we have

1471
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,400
in practice we will see that it's a

1472
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,960
little bit complicated

1473
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,080
um

1474
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,760
maybe it's also the like when we were

1475
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,040
looking at the Metro System that it's

1476
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,340
more about underground transportation

1477
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:51,440
so like separation okay

1478
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,780
transportation systems mm-hmm somebody

1479
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:58,320
somebody else started uh talking who was

1480
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,840
that yeah that was me and also

1481
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,100
also what I wanted to bring up was the

1482
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,880
where industry

1483
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,739
industry or small businesses are still

1484
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:10,080
located and where people can have you

1485
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,040
know

1486
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,980
um can find jobs almost in their in

1487
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,900
their neighborhood that it it you know

1488
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,420
especially maybe jobs that don't

1489
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:20,699
necessarily pay so well that wouldn't be

1490
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:22,679
interesting for other people to to

1491
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:25,020
commute into the city too and I think

1492
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,360
these kind of businesses are a bit under

1493
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,940
pressure from the reduction in space

1494
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,280
that they have on you know to to

1495
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,980
organize these productive activities so

1496
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:38,940
I think yeah space in front of there in

1497
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,040
front of the street to to actually do

1498
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,080
their deliveries and I think there's

1499
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,860
attention there in the kind of city

1500
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,600
um you want and the way you want the

1501
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,159
service different neighborhoods and

1502
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,480
different

1503
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,880
um different areas so one of the cases

1504
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,780
was like um these smaller construction

1505
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,500
um supplies kind of stores maybe in the

1506
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,840
area of lack and like not far from the

1507
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,120
canal you know serving a kind of a

1508
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,480
secondary places where you know you just

1509
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,940
wouldn't go to Bricco for those kind of

1510
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,739
um materials you would go to your

1511
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:15,719
neighborhood and that's that's becoming

1512
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:18,540
harder with uh you know to to maintain

1513
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,239
in a in an urban environment that gives

1514
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:24,719
more space to walking and to to to to

1515
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,179
um yeah to bike lanes and so on so

1516
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:28,679
that's on the one side it doesn't mean

1517
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,780
that I agree but it's I think one of the

1518
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:34,320
one of the pressures that is being

1519
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,320
um this is being felt by by that by that

1520
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,060
group I mean I guess what's what's

1521
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,100
important what you said and to relate it

1522
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,420
also to what I was talking about before

1523
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,860
and what we tell you there is the

1524
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,480
writing is that there is some with each

1525
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,940
of these technological shifts of course

1526
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,380
they are very

1527
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,960
um I mean it's a very broad sketch these

1528
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,480
things were not happening in in sudden

1529
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,360
turns it's a it's a process but the

1530
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,940
space is valorized in different ways and

1531
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,739
for example if we see here in this slide

1532
01:13:01,739 --> 01:13:03,600
as I mentioned

1533
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,260
um

1534
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,420
clearly space became very limited with

1535
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,860
the rise of the cars and the decision

1536
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,380
was made that the space is extremely

1537
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,820
valuable and it should be given to the

1538
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,159
modes that it's the most efficient in

1539
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,080
terms of speed as the most rational mode

1540
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,199
also not only economically or or

1541
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:22,020
temporally efficient so other modes like

1542
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,000
public transport or I don't even mention

1543
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,540
cycling there had to disappear or be

1544
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,280
moved elsewhere and I think what's

1545
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,900
happening right now is some kind of

1546
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,659
revolarization of space

1547
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,640
um but space is always limited so if you

1548
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,280
take it uh I mean if you give it to one

1549
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,739
or some set of users

1550
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:43,380
which I think also perhaps we will have

1551
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,120
time to talk about it next week has a

1552
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,860
clear class component so there is a

1553
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:49,920
clear middle class idea and behind

1554
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,100
opening Central uh Urban spaces to

1555
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,900
walking cycling and public transport and

1556
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,239
taking it away from the car so if you

1557
01:13:57,239 --> 01:13:58,860
give it to these kind of users you have

1558
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,780
to take it away from others in this case

1559
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,920
the car

1560
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,960
and I think an important question is to

1561
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,900
ask well if we want the car to disappear

1562
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,760
from the city like from Brussels who is

1563
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,219
using the car right I mean who is who is

1564
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:13,940
dependent on it for example these

1565
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:17,699
businesses small shops that um I don't

1566
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:20,040
know either well I mean they play

1567
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,540
productive activity requires

1568
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,420
accessibility by car but also I think

1569
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,159
um probably you've heard and right now

1570
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,620
in this pandemic crazy times people are

1571
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:30,300
talking about 15-minute neighborhood and

1572
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,560
the idea of how

1573
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,560
the pandemic has shown us that we can

1574
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,500
well since we uh essentially many of us

1575
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,880
stop a lot of activities we started

1576
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,620
walking around and cycling and all that

1577
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:43,080
so the idea that maybe we could use this

1578
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,840
to reorganize the cities around uh 15

1579
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,060
minutes perimeters walking pyramids

1580
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,980
within which we can all find all the

1581
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,620
uses and functions that we need but I

1582
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,540
think an important question there is who

1583
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:57,480
actually lives so close to a good school

1584
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,719
a good job and all that and then

1585
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,239
Brussels but in many other cities there

1586
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:04,560
will be a lot of people who need to find

1587
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,780
employment uh quite far from where they

1588
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,840
live and a lot of them would have to go

1589
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,840
by car to to get to that job so what you

1590
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,239
know what then

1591
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:16,560
um

1592
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,719
I will continue with the with the

1593
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,400
lecture but I hope there will be space

1594
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,980
for for more for more questions

1595
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,120
um there was one point that I want to

1596
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,480
make that is you know I don't want to

1597
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,340
say main conclusion of this historical

1598
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,500
trajectory but I think an important

1599
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,179
Point

1600
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:35,460
um to keep in mind in in all this is

1601
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:36,719
that

1602
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,040
um

1603
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,679
it's not just a well it's not just a

1604
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:42,480
descriptive you know took the fox of

1605
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,280
what different modes of Transport were

1606
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,440
there and and how it impacted the urban

1607
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,480
reform I think this is something that is

1608
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,860
maybe a little bit interesting but

1609
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,000
essentially I don't think it's very

1610
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,400
critical and doesn't really allow us to

1611
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,860
understand uh too much about how the

1612
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,300
city functions or functioned in the past

1613
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,760
I think what's very important though is

1614
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,560
that with each of these shifts with each

1615
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,060
of these

1616
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,460
um turning points and dynamics that led

1617
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,800
to to uh to a shift in terms of how

1618
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,020
people moved we were getting closer and

1619
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,159
closer

1620
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:13,020
um to the situation that we have today

1621
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:15,060
which is that transport is absolutely

1622
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,219
crucial uh not only for the development

1623
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:19,940
of cities but for the development of

1624
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:23,219
the socio-economic system which we live

1625
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:25,320
uh today on a global scale which is that

1626
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,440
of of global capitalism uh so it would

1627
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,719
be import impossible for for the current

1628
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,820
socioeconomic relations to to develop to

1629
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:33,840
the point that they have developed

1630
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,280
without transport and without the

1631
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,260
development of transport and vice versa

1632
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,239
so outside of the capitalist system

1633
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:41,280
there probably would not have been such

1634
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,560
such a push for development of

1635
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,780
individual vulnerability for example and

1636
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,640
individual Mobility by car that is

1637
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:50,340
propelled by fossil fuels uh with all

1638
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,980
the geopolitical and environmental uh

1639
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,960
atrocities and impacts that this this

1640
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,500
produces

1641
01:16:57,719 --> 01:16:59,760
um essentially transport or transport

1642
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,460
geography is a discipline uh required

1643
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:05,400
space Not only to be conquered

1644
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,380
physically intensive distance basically

1645
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:10,800
uh moving from A to B would become as

1646
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,460
fast as short of a time as possible but

1647
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,800
also uh some kind of imaginary and

1648
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,719
cartographical colonization or

1649
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,320
conquering of space if we go back to end

1650
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,820
of the 18th century for example in

1651
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,040
Europe uh well the majority of people

1652
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,440
who inhabited uh well maybe eight of the

1653
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,880
17th century could be a little bit less

1654
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,800
controversial but the majority of people

1655
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,360
who lived on our continent and

1656
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,679
definitely the majority of people who

1657
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:37,080
lived on our planet did not live on the

1658
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,880
jurisdiction of any state or any any

1659
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,159
state Administration they essentially

1660
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:42,659
lived outside State structures of course

1661
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,360
State States and administrations existed

1662
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,179
but most people lived in villages in

1663
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:51,000
areas where once in a once in a while a

1664
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,560
tax collector would maybe show up it

1665
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,900
would be quite easy to avoid the

1666
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,760
encounter with that kind of gentleman

1667
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,239
rather not gentle woman I'm afraid

1668
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:01,440
so

1669
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,600
it's at this point and I think transport

1670
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,280
is absolutely crucial for understanding

1671
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,540
of why this happened and how this

1672
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,360
happened that there happened or began to

1673
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,100
happen some kind of strategic expansion

1674
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,540
of State infrastructure and state

1675
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,760
Administration predominantly related to

1676
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,920
security reasons and search for you know

1677
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,159
different forms of capital uh for

1678
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,219
instance slavery so trying to uh reach

1679
01:18:23,219 --> 01:18:24,960
different places where bodies could be

1680
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,719
could be snatched taken into captivity

1681
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:29,760
and then and then sold or propelled into

1682
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,860
productive activity

1683
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,860
um but for the state to be able to

1684
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,540
organize this process it had to develop

1685
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,420
its cartography it has to develop its uh

1686
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,760
dominance its knowledge its control over

1687
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,860
the over space

1688
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:46,620
and here we see a map of France in 1632

1689
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,840
which is essentially well we've seen

1690
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,820
some roads we see some cities and and

1691
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:53,100
connections between those

1692
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,520
um but this radically changes with uh

1693
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,080
the development of States interest in

1694
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,239
terms of the resources uh as I mentioned

1695
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,000
bodies people but also of course other

1696
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,460
natural resources would anything that

1697
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:08,640
you can mine and well I don't know I'm

1698
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,020
not a specialist here in terms of who

1699
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,960
you can be interested in as a state but

1700
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,239
uh what essentially happened is that

1701
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:15,780
um

1702
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:18,540
from a natural space a space that was

1703
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:21,659
inhabited a space that was lived uh we

1704
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:24,480
started moving into a fire name of

1705
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,780
obstructive of uh of absolute space that

1706
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:28,920
is very much related to the

1707
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,659
consolidation of of States

1708
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:33,000
infrastructure as a way of organizing

1709
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,760
social and material order that is on the

1710
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,340
ground to bureaucratically govern it to

1711
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,140
rule it from the distance from a very

1712
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,580
top-down perspective

1713
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,440
the example of France is very

1714
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,300
interesting because literally over there

1715
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,159
the decision was made of course not

1716
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:49,020
immediately not at one meeting but

1717
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,520
progressively

1718
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,340
um it was a state bureaucrats arrived a

1719
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,840
decision to divide the state in more or

1720
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,060
less equally shaped

1721
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:57,719
um

1722
01:19:57,719 --> 01:20:00,960
areas the Departments and based on a

1723
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,179
regular grid on the left hand side you

1724
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:03,900
see there's some kind of

1725
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,400
conceptualization of this on the right

1726
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,620
hand side we see a result which is the

1727
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:10,380
the actual the eventual Division I think

1728
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,960
one of the first ones uh in in the in

1729
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,000
the French territory I think today of

1730
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,440
course it's not exactly the same that

1731
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,239
has developed for uh different

1732
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:21,120
historical reasons but the idea was very

1733
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,620
important that the seven the

1734
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:26,159
administrative reform of the 1790 would

1735
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,920
replace some old feudal uh tribal even

1736
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,260
uh division of territories

1737
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,820
into

1738
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,920
um it would be replaced with abstract

1739
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,679
bureaucratic logic that would be applied

1740
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,380
and more or less the same way in each of

1741
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,360
these each of these territories each of

1742
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,900
these uh departments

1743
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:49,380
as we can skip uh what was very

1744
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,360
important in this in this development is

1745
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,420
that the state needed very much uh

1746
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:57,040
um Universal

1747
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:57,719
[Music]

1748
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:58,440
um

1749
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,920
and how to put it a reliable system of

1750
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,100
measuring space and other related

1751
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,480
phenomena such as for example time or

1752
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,480
quantity it might be very difficult for

1753
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,820
us to to imagine this but the

1754
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:14,580
unification of of measuring systems both

1755
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,739
of time and space and quantity was

1756
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:18,540
something that took a very long time and

1757
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,239
it was definitely not in place until end

1758
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:23,940
of the even 17 or 18th century so it

1759
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,980
took a very long time to actually make

1760
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:29,520
sure make sure that all the inhabitants

1761
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,620
of a given nation state of a given

1762
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,780
territory would actually subjugate

1763
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,880
themselves to the usage of of a unified

1764
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,140
that's the word I was looking for

1765
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:41,100
unified metric or measurement system so

1766
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,300
for example the unification of the

1767
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,400
metric systems in Germany took place in

1768
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,699
as late as 1868 in Austria in 1871 and

1769
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:49,739
Hungary three years later in Russia in

1770
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:53,400
1919 and in China only in 1959. what

1771
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,040
does it mean it means that there existed

1772
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,480
of course ways of measuring but there

1773
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,520
will be culturally dependent or there

1774
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,260
will be spatially dependent so a

1775
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,659
particularly a unit of measurement a

1776
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:05,900
foot an elbow

1777
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,280
would mean different things in different

1778
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,840
Villages would mean different things at

1779
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,400
the different times of the day or yeah

1780
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,780
it would mean different things whether

1781
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,900
it would be the activity of selling or

1782
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,420
of buying so for example you would sell

1783
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:22,140
a small bag of rice and buy a big one

1784
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:22,739
um

1785
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:24,659
there was a difference between and

1786
01:22:24,659 --> 01:22:27,380
that's in many pre-colonial African

1787
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:30,120
communities kingdoms there will be a

1788
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,460
division between strong measures for

1789
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,040
selling goods and weak measures for for

1790
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,860
buying loans so there was a huge

1791
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:40,560
diversity of different ways of measuring

1792
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,360
space measuring time and measuring

1793
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,719
quantity all that in order and also

1794
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:48,120
because of and again this is a two-way

1795
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,280
Dynamic the development of the transport

1796
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,860
system and the development of State as a

1797
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:54,480
institution or a set of Institutions

1798
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,940
that had to control space quantity and

1799
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:01,679
time gave way to a unified system

1800
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,960
of which transport is absolutely Central

1801
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,840
and here I mean the symbolic one meter

1802
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,659
which is of course a huge abstract

1803
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:12,300
agreement that we are in that this is

1804
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,580
what one meter is and same could be said

1805
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:16,500
about a kilogram a second and many

1806
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,640
others

1807
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:20,699
moving a little bit more uh well going a

1808
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:23,280
little bit more into transport here

1809
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,920
um I mentioned time and for example as

1810
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,500
late as in the 18th century uh distance

1811
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,000
between particular cities and as a

1812
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,199
result of travel time speaking in

1813
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:33,179
particular cities such as in Germany

1814
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:37,140
we're not fixed or or set

1815
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:40,320
um so in 1881 German Railways or

1816
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,940
different kinds of German Railways

1817
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:43,260
because there was no one National system

1818
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,000
followed five different time zones which

1819
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,640
were different not by one hour but by a

1820
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,920
different amount of minutes which meant

1821
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,219
that basically one area I guess they are

1822
01:23:53,219 --> 01:23:55,860
here color coded would be five or seven

1823
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,480
minutes ahead of the other one which

1824
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,920
meant that the passengers had to do the

1825
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,260
calculation themselves it was all an

1826
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,659
oral agreement and an ongoing discussion

1827
01:24:03,659 --> 01:24:05,040
between

1828
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,420
um between the passengers and the staff

1829
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:08,940
to understand at what time uh things

1830
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,440
would happen what time the train would

1831
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,000
depart leave

1832
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,179
Etc

1833
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:15,719
um

1834
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:19,440
and as I mentioned the this integration

1835
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,960
of of measurement system integration of

1836
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,420
uh of different modes of Transport

1837
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:28,260
networks allowed the state to control to

1838
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:30,719
consolidate the territory and to

1839
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:33,840
um and to yeah to basically be able to

1840
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,000
develop socioeconomic relations that we

1841
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,699
take today very much for for granted

1842
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:42,960
um this was absolutely crucial I mean

1843
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,340
the reason why I'm making this a bit of

1844
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:46,080
a digression and the departure from you

1845
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,179
know this historic uh trajectory is that

1846
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:50,100
this was absolutely crucial this

1847
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:52,080
colonization of space and colonization

1848
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,060
of what we consider to be a very much of

1849
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,340
a social or could consider a social

1850
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,679
activity that movement and transport is

1851
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:00,540
was absolutely crucial for the

1852
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:02,520
development of again what we take very

1853
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,980
much for granted the global networks of

1854
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,920
wires cables railroads highways in this

1855
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,500
particular case I already show you that

1856
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,060
um that map

1857
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:16,080
allowing transport to to lubricate the

1858
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,900
capitalist global global system

1859
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:22,020
and today this colonization of space uh

1860
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,640
if we can call it this way it's no

1861
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,739
longer a national matter is no longer

1862
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:26,940
nation states that are propelling this

1863
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,380
process it's something that is happening

1864
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,500
very much on the on the global scales

1865
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,300
um

1866
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,060
what was very important in this very

1867
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,100
long trajectory I started very quickly

1868
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,199
at the end of the 17th century and now

1869
01:25:40,199 --> 01:25:43,260
we are in 1950s what was very important

1870
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,679
is that a whole science developed around

1871
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:48,600
uh this colonization of different

1872
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,540
measuring systems of different uh ways

1873
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:54,060
of of living and interacting with space

1874
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:56,159
and this science of this scientific

1875
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,900
field

1876
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,239
I think we can call it a set of

1877
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,880
neoclassical perspectives on not only

1878
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,500
transport but also in economics on

1879
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:07,920
social life which in transport itself is

1880
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,380
very much present is very much dominated

1881
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,699
by

1882
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:13,560
um on the one hand transport Engineers

1883
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,120
on the other hand transport Econo

1884
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,860
economists what I'm talking about here

1885
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,719
is basically

1886
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,900
um the main say and I will not talk a

1887
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,639
lot about this but basically if you went

1888
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:25,139
to

1889
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:27,780
um a master degree which I'm very happy

1890
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,760
you did it but if you went to a mass

1891
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,560
degree in in transport management or

1892
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,080
Logistics at any Technical University

1893
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,520
this is very much what you would be

1894
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,719
learning today

1895
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,760
I guess at this time of the Neo night

1896
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,980
which we are a bit more boring I hope

1897
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:43,560
than what I have to offer but

1898
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,420
um hope there is no regrets here in the

1899
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:47,460
room today but uh if you want to be an

1900
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,540
engineer and if you want to be an

1901
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,860
economist to build roads this is

1902
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:52,620
basically what you what you learn why is

1903
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,840
it called neoclassical transport well

1904
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,460
very much it relates to new classical

1905
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:59,460
economics which deals with uh a

1906
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:02,219
cold-blooded analysis A study of

1907
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:05,280
distribution production of goods outputs

1908
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,800
and and income through uh and that's

1909
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,760
absolutely crucial supply and demand so

1910
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,320
a system which has to be in a permanent

1911
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:15,260
equilibrium

1912
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:18,239
which essentially looks at transport as

1913
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:22,380
a part or a separate Market in which

1914
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:25,020
transport is a good commodity which is

1915
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:28,020
offered in the market passengers being

1916
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:31,820
the being its consumers

1917
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,360
um

1918
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,400
what is important here there are two

1919
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,699
main principles which very much today

1920
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:41,219
again in Academia but also very much in

1921
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:43,080
the world of practitioners so the wealth

1922
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,060
of those who plan roads who build roads

1923
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,920
who claim that we need a new metro line

1924
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,800
we need Motorway or that this or that

1925
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,060
particular mode of Transport is

1926
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,440
absolutely essential for for

1927
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,900
contemporary cities to thrive

1928
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,300
so these two dogmas say that on the one

1929
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,340
hand transport is an essentially

1930
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,280
rational discipline it's a it's a

1931
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,199
discipline that is rational because it

1932
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:07,500
has to be developed by by experts it's a

1933
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,900
top-down discipline that requires this

1934
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,060
top-down cartographic vision of space

1935
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:14,659
which can be reduced to its absolute

1936
01:28:14,659 --> 01:28:17,100
Universal measures

1937
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,300
um that also means that there is a

1938
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,400
science behind it which means that it's

1939
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,380
not an issue that can be fully opened to

1940
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,620
a public debate it's a it's a part of

1941
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,420
urban life that has to be developed by

1942
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:30,000
experts and only experts can have the

1943
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,980
final word in terms of decision making

1944
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:34,760
uh in terms of how transport develops

1945
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,780
why and and using what most

1946
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,080
um there is a very strong prediction

1947
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,120
there in this uh in this in this field

1948
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,699
of of knowledge that transport geography

1949
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,620
or or transport economics engineering

1950
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:48,780
are essentially objective Sciences they

1951
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:50,400
are they are much more on the side of

1952
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,199
science sciences and Humanities for

1953
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:55,020
example they they purpose being pursuing

1954
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,480
objectivity and truth that's a quote

1955
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,639
from another very important textbook on

1956
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:02,340
on transport geography the idea being is

1957
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,260
that we can arrive some kind of absolute

1958
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,540
truths in terms of what is good

1959
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:09,260
transport and wonder what is bad which

1960
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,460
essentially are translatable

1961
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:13,260
transferable from one locality to

1962
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:16,199
another so if uh if we go back to the

1963
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:21,080
1950s if the US cities develop

1964
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,100
motorways and develop car infrastructure

1965
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:24,600
which is efficient and rational this is

1966
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,000
a solution that can also work in dense

1967
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,300
medieval European cities uh such as the

1968
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,080
ones in Belgium Brussels for example

1969
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:34,679
um

1970
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:37,679
crucially this line of thinking and that

1971
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:39,960
maybe didn't develop in the end of the

1972
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,420
17th or 19th century but was definitely

1973
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:45,000
a result of this uh process that I

1974
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,219
called the colonization of space

1975
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:50,580
this field of of thinking and and

1976
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:52,860
producing uh transport Consolidated

1977
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:56,100
itself around the 1930s and 40s and that

1978
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,480
propelled

1979
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,699
um measurements and engineering studies

1980
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:02,880
that allowed to to construct these

1981
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,219
um into urban and intra-urban Motorway

1982
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:07,260
systems and this very much continues

1983
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:10,920
today following a rule of predicting uh

1984
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,159
demand for for Mobility predicting

1985
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:17,000
passenger flows or traffic flows and

1986
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,860
providing necessary infrastructure for

1987
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:23,280
it so basically most of Transport most

1988
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:27,199
of which transport models do is predict

1989
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:30,560
where would these flows go and provide

1990
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,940
essential infrastructure an extension of

1991
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:33,900
a

1992
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,300
of Road Lane a construction of a new

1993
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,880
Motorway construction of a new Metro uh

1994
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,060
line and you name it

1995
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,340
so that's one part of the rationality of

1996
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,560
Transport the other part is that the

1997
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,620
assumption is that the user itself uh

1998
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:54,360
and uh it's yeah yeah the user itself is

1999
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,420
also a rational being it's a homo

2000
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,239
economicus it's an it's an economically

2001
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:03,480
minded being that

2002
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,340
um almost on a regular basis on a daily

2003
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:06,900
basis conduct some kind of economic

2004
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:10,020
analysis in terms of what is uh an

2005
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:11,580
efficient way of of reaching a

2006
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:14,280
destination B from from point A in terms

2007
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,739
of time in terms of cost

2008
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:19,980
um being making pragmatic free and and

2009
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,260
very much utility-based choices in terms

2010
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:25,080
of how to move and where to move

2011
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,080
so in other words a market a market that

2012
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,960
is being governed by by the laws of uh

2013
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,139
of Economics which very much in this in

2014
01:31:34,139 --> 01:31:35,760
this line of thought are being compared

2015
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,219
to the laws of physics a lot of these

2016
01:31:38,219 --> 01:31:40,199
models would have for example allusions

2017
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:43,860
to gravity so gravity models that uh in

2018
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:46,560
a natural-like way pools uh flows of

2019
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,600
passengers to some destinations rather

2020
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,400
than others because for example economic

2021
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,120
activities present in an area

2022
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,340
so that's

2023
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:57,719
principle of Dogma number one and number

2024
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:00,600
two is that uh there is this very strong

2025
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,380
conviction and funny enough still not

2026
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:06,480
fully fully proven but uh but the

2027
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,880
conviction is very much there that

2028
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,080
investment in transport infrastructure

2029
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,900
uh of course uh that part is not

2030
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:15,540
controversial leads to higher speeds uh

2031
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,940
leads to lower travel times at least

2032
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,800
lower transaction costs if you want to

2033
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,139
move from A to B or yourself or some

2034
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:24,480
Goods it's basically cheaper leads to

2035
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,219
Economic Development so the better

2036
01:32:26,219 --> 01:32:29,460
infrastructure we have the the higher or

2037
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:32,699
the better the growth of a locality so

2038
01:32:32,699 --> 01:32:35,159
if you want the city to be economically

2039
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:39,600
prosperous uh wealthy you need

2040
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,820
um you need Quality Transport

2041
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,639
infrastructure

2042
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:45,300
um

2043
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:49,320
so that very much is on the pin by this

2044
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,940
um by this quote that I already

2045
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:52,500
mentioned earlier today that the unique

2046
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,719
purpose of Transport is in fact to to

2047
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,300
limit to reduce space and time that is

2048
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:00,179
needed to cover the space to zero that

2049
01:33:00,179 --> 01:33:01,920
that is the unique purpose of of

2050
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,219
movement in in the city which also means

2051
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:06,900
that the travel time itself is an

2052
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:09,239
unproductive activity because from the

2053
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:10,739
monetary perspective if you want to go

2054
01:33:10,739 --> 01:33:12,179
from A to B

2055
01:33:12,179 --> 01:33:13,739
um well you want to get there as quickly

2056
01:33:13,739 --> 01:33:15,179
as possible the time of getting there

2057
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:18,360
itself is not a valuable activity now

2058
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,159
there are I mean there's a flurry of

2059
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:21,659
problems here starting from the fact

2060
01:33:21,659 --> 01:33:23,340
that if you actually ask people through

2061
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,440
studies uh what they do when they take

2062
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,719
the metro or where they cycle which is

2063
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:30,060
such a complicated and multi-faceted

2064
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,520
activity they very often say that this

2065
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,380
is actually a very important part of the

2066
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,540
day that commuting on public transport

2067
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,699
for example allows them to catch up with

2068
01:33:38,699 --> 01:33:41,159
friends to read to relax to meditate

2069
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:43,880
cycling being as I mentioned

2070
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,260
multi-faceted activity allows people to

2071
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:49,100
get relaxed work out

2072
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:52,380
get an endorphin kick and and all that

2073
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,600
and that's so much more than just moving

2074
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,760
from from one place to

2075
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,300
um to another

2076
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,659
um but again without trying to draw some

2077
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:04,920
kind of caricature I think it's

2078
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:07,620
important to to understand that this way

2079
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:10,080
of thinking about transport leads us to

2080
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,820
a formulation of an absolutely

2081
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:14,699
fundamental problem uh in inverted

2082
01:34:14,699 --> 01:34:16,679
commas that a lot of Engineers transport

2083
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:18,480
Engineers transport economists recognize

2084
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,480
and that problem is congestion if you

2085
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,679
focus on a fluid flow of

2086
01:34:24,679 --> 01:34:27,960
passengers cars whatever the transport

2087
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,540
mode is any obstruction to that flow any

2088
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,400
obstruction to that model is a is a

2089
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,260
problem that has to be solved

2090
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,420
and that problem has to be solved

2091
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,860
because otherwise the system is

2092
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:39,659
irrational that's talking about number

2093
01:34:39,659 --> 01:34:41,280
one and

2094
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:44,639
the second reason is that uh and unless

2095
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,340
you do that you uh you can

2096
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:48,000
um

2097
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,219
hamper the economic growth the economic

2098
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:52,320
development of of the locality that

2099
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,840
you're in in charge of

2100
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:58,020
as I mentioned this uh this beneficial

2101
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,580
supposedly beneficial relationship

2102
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,080
between transport development and

2103
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,360
economic development so better roads

2104
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,460
mean better transport better exchange of

2105
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:07,620
goods and services

2106
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,420
um that of course Works to some extent I

2107
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,760
mean you can you can see that happening

2108
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,520
theoretically at least from scratch in

2109
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,040
um in many cities many countries of the

2110
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,800
global South but then uh this relation

2111
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,120
has never really been theorized it's

2112
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,679
never really been proven and it will be

2113
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:24,659
extremely difficult to to make that

2114
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:28,620
claim in cities that are postmodern so

2115
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:30,659
such as Brussels or many other cities in

2116
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:31,500
the global North but actually

2117
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,360
increasingly also Global South so

2118
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,460
addition of infrastructure especially

2119
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:38,940
road infrastructure car infrastructure

2120
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:41,400
um and it's anticipated impact in terms

2121
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,380
of economic growth Economic Development

2122
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,300
it's it's a very controversial issue

2123
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,560
that

2124
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,540
um well it's not really we don't have

2125
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,840
any tangible proof or tangible enough to

2126
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,120
to uh to say with certainty that this is

2127
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:54,960
the case

2128
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,840
but it's an argument that you can hear a

2129
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,940
lot and including in Brussels and

2130
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:01,080
Belgium

2131
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:04,199
is this clear do you have any questions

2132
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:05,639
this is usually where people are

2133
01:36:05,639 --> 01:36:08,460
scratching their hands a little bit so I

2134
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,280
want to make sure that you are okay

2135
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:13,199
uh nobody is writing anything in the

2136
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,739
chat no Angry comments I keep

2137
01:36:16,739 --> 01:36:19,020
advancing here then

2138
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:21,000
um so what happens when you when you

2139
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,040
believe that what you do is is rational

2140
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,080
and and it's very important for Society

2141
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,880
for economy

2142
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,080
well you essentially engage in I mean

2143
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,300
um developing more and more and more to

2144
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,699
elaborate and complicated mathematical

2145
01:36:35,699 --> 01:36:38,520
models that try to predict not only to

2146
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,080
describe what's happening without

2147
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,780
actually trying to predict uh what is

2148
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,520
going to happen and what is now

2149
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,260
happening very much in the business of

2150
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:47,880
transport economics and transport

2151
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,679
engineering is modeling human behavior

2152
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,800
so trying to predict uh where people

2153
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,420
will be interested in going and not

2154
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:56,159
anymore where where they are actually

2155
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,679
are heading and where these flaws are

2156
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:00,239
being distributed in an urban

2157
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:03,360
environment what's crucial here is that

2158
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,620
this field is extremely not only

2159
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,360
extremely Technical and quantitative but

2160
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:09,420
it's very indescriptive so this logic of

2161
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,219
Transport Supply and transport demand is

2162
01:37:11,219 --> 01:37:14,340
is devoid of any social uh cultural

2163
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:18,000
political uh relations so

2164
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,699
when I say that a transport user this

2165
01:37:20,699 --> 01:37:22,860
homo economicus is considered to be this

2166
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:26,280
rational utility-based uh person or

2167
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,440
figure that makes these rational choices

2168
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,600
in terms of where they go and how any

2169
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:33,060
issue of gender any issue of class or

2170
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:36,120
ethnicity of age is

2171
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,540
um at best mentioned but given a very

2172
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:41,280
little weight if we are talking about

2173
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,199
modeling so these different aspects can

2174
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,060
be given different ways given different

2175
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:47,699
importance importance different levels

2176
01:37:47,699 --> 01:37:50,040
of levels of importance and these issues

2177
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,980
are quite simply not not there and of

2178
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,540
course we will be discussing this a

2179
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:55,620
little bit I mean these different

2180
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,880
critical approaches such as

2181
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,100
well some anti-capitalist marxists

2182
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:03,380
feminist

2183
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:07,080
uh any radical Theory social theory the

2184
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,239
exposure to those in engineering

2185
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:12,060
programs is close to none

2186
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,340
um which basically means that without

2187
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:16,380
trying to be you know too critical about

2188
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,699
the engineers who are trying to do their

2189
01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:18,780
job

2190
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,460
um basically they they are really not

2191
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,800
aware of of the complexity of social

2192
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,480
relations and spatial relations that are

2193
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,800
happening in the city so everything that

2194
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,139
you've learned with David bass and Nick

2195
01:38:28,139 --> 01:38:31,620
by now this is this is simply not there

2196
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:34,080
um a city according to this vision is

2197
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,920
essentially a a model that can be

2198
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,199
um constructed calculated and put in

2199
01:38:40,199 --> 01:38:43,860
place and you can predict what will

2200
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:45,659
happen uh tomorrow or the day after

2201
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:49,020
based on that in any City in the in the

2202
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:49,739
world

2203
01:38:49,739 --> 01:38:54,719
now that thinking uh has a very yeah

2204
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:58,080
very very strange uh way of Imagining

2205
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,020
the city essentially if a city is or any

2206
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:03,239
Urban space is more of a field of

2207
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:05,639
application than than actually a side of

2208
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:07,260
any Dynamics or conflicts or

2209
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:09,960
contradictions uh different interests in

2210
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,400
terms of what should be happening in

2211
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,620
that space in that in that society and

2212
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:16,159
I'm sure that you've all come across um

2213
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:19,199
uh maybe even these drawings or similar

2214
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:22,380
ones from from Nicole busier and his and

2215
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,300
his friends and allies who basically

2216
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,739
imagine that this is exactly what should

2217
01:39:25,739 --> 01:39:28,199
happen in in a modern city that these

2218
01:39:28,199 --> 01:39:30,840
models not only related to transport in

2219
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,639
this case also to housing or generally

2220
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,560
Economic Development should be literally

2221
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,659
applied in a city

2222
01:39:36,659 --> 01:39:39,360
um so the idea there would be that in

2223
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,860
order to for that model to be as

2224
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,020
efficient as possible everything in the

2225
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,480
city especially it's medieval it's

2226
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,239
pre-industrial uh remnants would have to

2227
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:49,860
be raised the city would have to become

2228
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:53,280
black empathy slave on which this model

2229
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,820
could be applied

2230
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:59,820
so

2231
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,880
even though

2232
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:05,159
this maybe wasn't its most extreme in

2233
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:07,920
the 1950s in the 1960s when these Urban

2234
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,920
motorways were being constructed when as

2235
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,659
I showed you these Urban tramways and

2236
01:40:12,659 --> 01:40:14,040
Brussels were being put on the ground

2237
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:17,219
and a lot of heavy construction offers

2238
01:40:17,219 --> 01:40:20,040
destruction had to be done this thinking

2239
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,560
still very much applies this if you if

2240
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,480
you tune in to Engineers from

2241
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,159
construction offices in Brussels or

2242
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:28,679
elsewhere in Belgium

2243
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:31,920
northern Europe the idea is that uh

2244
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,860
planning still has to fall follow uh

2245
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,659
some rational rules of solving

2246
01:40:36,659 --> 01:40:39,120
congestion uh in Brussels for example we

2247
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,980
have a Belgium a long-standing debate

2248
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:42,060
about what to do with the Ring of

2249
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,739
Brussels the Ring Road whether it has to

2250
01:40:43,739 --> 01:40:45,600
be expanded or not every single time

2251
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,159
there is an engineer talking on the

2252
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:49,800
radio or on the news what their solution

2253
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,600
would be is to add to the infrastructure

2254
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,100
because basically if you have traffic

2255
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:55,560
jams that generates lost time that's

2256
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,360
detrimental to the economy you have to

2257
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,920
expand that infrastructure in order for

2258
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:01,080
the flows to be more fluid and

2259
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,679
unobstructed

2260
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:06,659
This Modern neoclassical thinking also

2261
01:41:06,659 --> 01:41:10,500
uh well thinking about the fluidity of

2262
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,560
flows and and removing barriers to these

2263
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,719
led to a separation of different modes

2264
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:18,300
of Transport so this is this is why we

2265
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:22,380
would have uh overpasses uh food bridges

2266
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:25,440
that would allow of well separate

2267
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,360
pedestrians from Cars For example so

2268
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,400
allow the cars to have

2269
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:32,880
um a smooth smooth space infrastructure

2270
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,980
to for movement while pedestrians would

2271
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:36,260
have to

2272
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:40,679
cross it uh cross it over all the energy

2273
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:43,380
and that of course also

2274
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:45,000
um that line of thought would be very

2275
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,980
much related or very much inspired also

2276
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:48,540
by the development of individual

2277
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:51,360
Mobility via VIA the car right so the

2278
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,760
car being not only this extremely

2279
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,920
freeing mode of Transport also a very

2280
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,659
rational and very fast way of moving

2281
01:41:57,659 --> 01:41:58,920
around

2282
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,540
now

2283
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:03,719
we arrived to the 1970s let's say and

2284
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:05,159
something very important happened around

2285
01:42:05,159 --> 01:42:06,239
that time

2286
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:08,040
would anybody have an idea looking at

2287
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:11,940
the pictures uh What uh what I have in

2288
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:13,500
mind

2289
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:16,020
not change the way that we look at the

2290
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:18,000
car the change of the way we look at the

2291
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,199
transport

2292
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,840
the only crisis in the oil crisis I

2293
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,340
guess somebody already mentioned that in

2294
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,719
one of the classes

2295
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:27,540
so the oil trucks of the 1970s

2296
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:31,340
um when first in the 1973 uh the

2297
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:33,780
organization of our petroleum exporting

2298
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:35,520
countries so essentially the the Persian

2299
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,400
Gulf countries uh instituted Noel

2300
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:41,159
embargo in the 1979 Iranian Revolution

2301
01:42:41,159 --> 01:42:43,679
uh took place that's not something that

2302
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:46,199
you can easily model that's geopolitics

2303
01:42:46,199 --> 01:42:47,820
for you and what basically happened is

2304
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,440
that the global oil prices went through

2305
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,940
the roof

2306
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:53,100
um not maybe for a moment for a longer

2307
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:55,199
time but and then they went

2308
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:57,239
um down a little bit to a level that

2309
01:42:57,239 --> 01:42:59,219
allowed of course for for car-based

2310
01:42:59,219 --> 01:43:02,100
Mobility to to continue but the what

2311
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:04,199
basically happened was that

2312
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:06,060
um on a global scale

2313
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:09,000
decision makers people who were in

2314
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,440
charge of Designing transport

2315
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:12,960
infrastructure realized that this

2316
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,719
Limitless Mobility by car has its um

2317
01:43:15,719 --> 01:43:17,580
it's its economic cost First of all that

2318
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:20,159
fossil fuels might not be as available

2319
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,980
as as they as they used to be but also

2320
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:26,040
around that time began to begin some

2321
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:29,179
kind of uh

2322
01:43:29,699 --> 01:43:32,540
move to this slide already uh

2323
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:35,580
reflection on on different externalities

2324
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:37,199
of different also social and

2325
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,540
environmental costs that are related to

2326
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,940
to car based Mobility these

2327
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:43,380
environmental costs being for example

2328
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:45,980
are predominantly noise

2329
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:48,840
of course accidents health related

2330
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:51,780
issues uh mostly related to pollution

2331
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:54,719
that is that is created by by individual

2332
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:57,119
costs

2333
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:57,780
um

2334
01:43:57,780 --> 01:44:00,659
and around that time I mean maybe it's

2335
01:44:00,659 --> 01:44:01,980
also difficult for us to imagine but

2336
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:06,420
until the 1970s the idea that a car uh

2337
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:08,040
to be efficient in terms of its fuel

2338
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:10,199
consumption it has to be safe in terms

2339
01:44:10,199 --> 01:44:12,420
of making sure that if it hits other

2340
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,340
vehicles or with his pedestrians or

2341
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:17,639
cyclists it has to be more or less safe

2342
01:44:17,639 --> 01:44:19,980
and and that there are these different

2343
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:22,860
areas of the car that uh that absorb the

2344
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:26,000
the energy of the impact that was all uh

2345
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,020
essentially noted there with some

2346
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:31,020
exceptions uh a car was

2347
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,179
um the cars were not efficient from the

2348
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:35,400
from the economic perspective from the

2349
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,940
environmental perspective either

2350
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:42,900
uh what changed is that well I'm again

2351
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:45,540
moving very fast to these uh through

2352
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:47,760
these developments but what changed is

2353
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,580
that there was uh first a reflection on

2354
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,260
the environmental and impact of the car

2355
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:53,880
itself

2356
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:55,980
um and a general reflection on the on

2357
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:57,360
the question of sustainable development

2358
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,300
of development that

2359
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:02,340
allows uh future generations to benefit

2360
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:04,020
from the same resources from the same

2361
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:06,179
opportunities that we are we are

2362
01:45:06,179 --> 01:45:09,300
benefiting from today so some kind of

2363
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:11,460
beginning of a reflection in terms of

2364
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:13,860
the planetary limits of of the growth

2365
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,920
that our societies are of the societies

2366
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:20,040
at the time where we're engaging in

2367
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:23,520
and also an idea that uh

2368
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,500
uh cities are absolutely crucial for

2369
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:29,340
that in that process that in order to

2370
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:31,980
arrive with uh at sustainability of the

2371
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:34,139
development on the planetary level uh

2372
01:45:34,139 --> 01:45:36,780
cities have to uh have to also be

2373
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:39,000
transformed in order to become more

2374
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,960
sustainable

2375
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:46,199
why is that important and we arrive to

2376
01:45:46,199 --> 01:45:50,040
to today to contemporary situation well

2377
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:53,340
it's important and yeah this is as also

2378
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:56,760
the title uh says this is the

2379
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:58,500
let's say a

2380
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:00,840
another set of also very dominant and

2381
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:02,840
very very important hegemonic

2382
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:05,159
perspectives on transport sustainable

2383
01:46:05,159 --> 01:46:06,780
Urban transport this is because

2384
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:09,360
transport is recognized today as one of

2385
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,580
the most important sources of um or

2386
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:14,940
contributors to pollution here we uh see

2387
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:17,580
that it's at least 14 of CO2 Emissions

2388
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,980
on the on the global scale as the uh

2389
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:22,560
direct emissions

2390
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,540
um and also while the graph I would say

2391
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,980
that it's a little bit controversial

2392
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,780
because you also could add much more in

2393
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,940
terms of the different other related

2394
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,699
course on construction and and the way

2395
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:34,619
that housing is constructed as as a

2396
01:46:34,619 --> 01:46:36,900
function of of availability of Transport

2397
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,420
but let's say we stick to the 14 of

2398
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:41,280
global emissions being related directly

2399
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,619
to transport which makes transport one

2400
01:46:43,619 --> 01:46:45,300
of the

2401
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:47,159
um well here I'm a little bit wrong that

2402
01:46:47,159 --> 01:46:48,540
is the largest single source of global

2403
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,920
Transportation emissions because you

2404
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,960
immediately see that industry is at 21

2405
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,760
but it can be also boiled to the

2406
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,500
different sectors and all that but

2407
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,300
what's very important with transport is

2408
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,100
that this um definitely one of the

2409
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:02,340
fastest if not the fastest uh Rising uh

2410
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:04,020
contributed to to emissions so every

2411
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,699
year the increase is the highest among

2412
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:08,820
all economic sectors globally so Global

2413
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:10,560
Climate problems are essentially

2414
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,380
increasingly transport problems this is

2415
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:16,260
uh this is let's say maybe not Point of

2416
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:17,280
Departure but one of the main

2417
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,440
reflections of this perspective on on

2418
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,420
the issue

2419
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:23,760
what also is very important is that as

2420
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,639
you see on the left hand side the global

2421
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:28,619
proportion of people living in in urban

2422
01:47:28,619 --> 01:47:32,639
communities is rising so one if in 2010

2423
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:36,060
we were already after this magic uh

2424
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:38,520
threshold of 50 or more of people living

2425
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:40,520
in cities as opposed to the countryside

2426
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:43,980
in 2030 the projection is that it will

2427
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:45,960
be 60 of people living in cities and

2428
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:49,080
that will go up to at least 67 in 2015.

2429
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,540
of course this is a mantra that I'm sure

2430
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:52,800
that at least those of you who follow

2431
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,300
the master and urban Studies have

2432
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,340
already heard before that we are living

2433
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:59,659
in an urban society that you know and

2434
01:47:59,659 --> 01:48:02,580
our planet is essentially in urban and

2435
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:04,860
urban planetary urbanization there's a

2436
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:08,580
lot of Concepts uh flying flying around

2437
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:12,119
but it's important and it is a fact that

2438
01:48:12,119 --> 01:48:13,800
increasingly the global population

2439
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:16,619
becoming more and more urban it's in the

2440
01:48:16,619 --> 01:48:18,239
cities that a lot of these problems will

2441
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:19,619
have to be addressed so the urban

2442
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:21,719
Mobility is not only the transport is

2443
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:23,760
crucial for solving the climate crisis

2444
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,320
but it's the urban transport that

2445
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:27,659
constitutes definitely a very important

2446
01:48:27,659 --> 01:48:30,719
uh challenge that has to be addressed so

2447
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,520
we see that and that's the right hand

2448
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:35,760
side graft graph that Urban Mobility

2449
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:38,400
demand for urban Mobility is rising uh

2450
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,780
almost exponentially

2451
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:41,460
and that's expressing trillions of

2452
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:44,639
kilometers per year here uh that it Rose

2453
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:49,860
from uh 2010 to 2030 by uh 68 percent

2454
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:53,040
now we might think that with all the

2455
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,619
reflection on externalities that cars

2456
01:48:55,619 --> 01:48:58,560
have and produce an environmental and

2457
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,840
social aspects that are very detrimental

2458
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:03,780
to to our lives

2459
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:06,360
um that we are moving away from the car

2460
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:08,699
this is a perspective that we already

2461
01:49:08,699 --> 01:49:11,219
had a short charge on that there is a

2462
01:49:11,219 --> 01:49:13,440
shift so we start to look at Urban space

2463
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,880
a little bit differently we want less

2464
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,340
cars to be present in it and in fact on

2465
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:18,780
a global scale

2466
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:20,820
um if you look at the on the left hand

2467
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:23,639
side as a cumulative figure so the

2468
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:26,219
global number of all registered cars uh

2469
01:49:26,219 --> 01:49:29,699
the rise is is ongoing and it's um and

2470
01:49:29,699 --> 01:49:32,659
it's huge and that's

2471
01:49:32,659 --> 01:49:35,580
well also seen in the graph on the right

2472
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:37,760
hand side where we see non-cumulative

2473
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,760
yearly amount of cars being sold

2474
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:43,440
on a global scale so we see that every

2475
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,480
year the amount of cars being sold is

2476
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:48,719
rising 2019 being some sort of an

2477
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:50,219
exception we have a little bit of a drop

2478
01:49:50,219 --> 01:49:53,100
but what the graph doesn't not show is

2479
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:56,100
the amount of SUV so the sports utility

2480
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:58,440
vehicles as they are called which went

2481
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:01,619
through the roof in 2018 and 2019 their

2482
01:50:01,619 --> 01:50:03,420
contribution environmentally speaking

2483
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:05,520
being much uh High a few times higher

2484
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,100
than regular vehicles what also you can

2485
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:11,460
see over there is that in Orange if you

2486
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:13,560
see that the contribution we can call it

2487
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,179
this way of the European Union countries

2488
01:50:15,179 --> 01:50:18,060
in terms of the number of cars sold is

2489
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:20,699
more or less stable so here we don't see

2490
01:50:20,699 --> 01:50:23,100
um an important rise if you look at

2491
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:26,900
India in Gray and then on China in Blue

2492
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:30,239
uh here the difference between 2005 and

2493
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,580
2019 is significant

2494
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:36,719
so there is a lot of economies some call

2495
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:38,219
them developing economies I'm not really

2496
01:50:38,219 --> 01:50:40,560
a fan of the word but um

2497
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,239
a lot of nation states a lot of

2498
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:44,100
societies where where the levels of

2499
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:46,260
motorizations were relatively low and

2500
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:49,500
this commodity is is definitely becoming

2501
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,719
uh more and more available it's not

2502
01:50:51,719 --> 01:50:52,980
exactly the same process that was

2503
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:55,619
happening uh in in northern Europe or

2504
01:50:55,619 --> 01:50:57,659
North America or Western Europe or North

2505
01:50:57,659 --> 01:51:01,679
America in the 1940s 50s and 60s but uh

2506
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:03,780
it's definitely a steep rise of

2507
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:06,659
motorization of Mobility levels which

2508
01:51:06,659 --> 01:51:08,460
raises a lot of environmental questions

2509
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:10,800
but also ethical issues in terms of

2510
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,159
whether this is something that

2511
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:16,800
um well we now with our Western Northern

2512
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,199
eyes are looking at very critically

2513
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:21,000
matter of fact it's something that these

2514
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,679
people these societies have the right to

2515
01:51:22,679 --> 01:51:25,320
engage in as as we did as our parents

2516
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:29,159
and grandparents did some decades ago

2517
01:51:29,159 --> 01:51:31,440
um but what is very important here I'm

2518
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,480
going to skip this one slide is that

2519
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:35,760
this debate if we can put it this way

2520
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:38,280
shifts its attention so we're moving

2521
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:41,639
away from the problem of congestion the

2522
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:43,520
problem of uh

2523
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,199
unobstructed flows uh the problem of

2524
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:48,600
rationality the problem of Economic

2525
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,760
Development we see that this Economic

2526
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:53,580
Development has its

2527
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:57,119
um environmental price if we can put it

2528
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:59,639
this way and in a very important and

2529
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:01,560
very important and symbol of that in

2530
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:04,260
mobility in transport is the car is is

2531
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:05,880
the car is the

2532
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:09,239
important contributor to to that uh to

2533
01:52:09,239 --> 01:52:11,400
that cake in terms of pollution in terms

2534
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:13,739
of externalities of

2535
01:52:13,739 --> 01:52:15,900
um of transport

2536
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:18,420
and next time so we still have a bit

2537
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:21,060
time for questions maybe discussion

2538
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:23,159
we're going to talk about specific

2539
01:52:23,159 --> 01:52:26,219
examples of how transport develops along

2540
01:52:26,219 --> 01:52:28,020
this line of thought

2541
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:32,340
but and I think we'll be uh well it's

2542
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:33,480
definitely not the only thing we're

2543
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,040
going to do because as I will also

2544
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,020
explain in a week

2545
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:39,300
um that perspective also is extremely

2546
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:42,840
Limited in its lack of social and also

2547
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:45,300
spatial understanding of the city so a

2548
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,340
simple critique of the car as the

2549
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:50,159
problem is also leading us into a number

2550
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:54,199
of traps which mean that our

2551
01:52:54,199 --> 01:52:57,600
understanding of how people enjoy or do

2552
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,760
not enjoy Mobility because of the class

2553
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,860
the gender the ethnicity and many other

2554
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:06,179
factors is extremely Limited

2555
01:53:06,179 --> 01:53:09,719
so I put a little comma here

2556
01:53:09,719 --> 01:53:11,119
um I wonder if you have any questions

2557
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:14,100
any points of discussion

2558
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:16,920
we still have 12 minutes so we might as

2559
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:18,659
well use them

2560
01:53:18,659 --> 01:53:22,520
just ice

2561
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:25,739
I might

2562
01:53:25,739 --> 01:53:26,460
um

2563
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:30,080
try to initiate a little discussion here

2564
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:34,440
about about popularity of cars and

2565
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:35,219
um

2566
01:53:35,219 --> 01:53:38,460
and the Smiths that we're now seeing of

2567
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:42,780
of the of the of the lifestyle on high

2568
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:45,780
speed and Etc

2569
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:49,199
um I observed a curious a curious thing

2570
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:52,560
that on TV in Belgium at least I don't

2571
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:57,179
usually watch TV but I happen to watch

2572
01:53:57,179 --> 01:54:01,739
uh one night with my friends like a

2573
01:54:01,739 --> 01:54:05,639
generic Belgium Belgium program and

2574
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:07,400
during the advertisement

2575
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:11,880
uh period all the ads a vast majority of

2576
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:14,040
them were about cars

2577
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,500
and uh

2578
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,679
in any or in all ways they were trying

2579
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:22,040
to sell either a lifestyle the

2580
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:26,340
ecological ecological idea that new cars

2581
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:30,300
to be can be green and Etc but I was

2582
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:35,400
wondering if we might ever arrive to to

2583
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,960
to this

2584
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:39,060
um to this thinking that we should not

2585
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:42,179
be advertising this anymore as we don't

2586
01:54:42,179 --> 01:54:45,199
advertise cigarettes or I don't know

2587
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:48,139
hard alcohol on on

2588
01:54:48,139 --> 01:54:52,619
TV and in media and whether it makes

2589
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:55,940
sense or it doesn't

2590
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,560
it's an interesting thought we will

2591
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,360
actually come back to it next time but I

2592
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,520
wonder if somebody has already you know

2593
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,860
an opinion on this

2594
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:07,679
should advertising car cars or sales

2595
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:09,719
cards would be banned because it's

2596
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:13,280
but for society

2597
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:24,060
maybe I can even add to this that

2598
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:24,600
um

2599
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,940
I've been watching Belgian TV for a long

2600
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:30,540
time as I'm convention and um

2601
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:33,360
I there always used to be uh car

2602
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:36,659
commercials but in the last two years

2603
01:55:36,659 --> 01:55:39,119
um actually most of them has have been

2604
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:41,159
for SUV

2605
01:55:41,159 --> 01:55:45,719
uh cars or like there's been a bit shift

2606
01:55:45,719 --> 01:55:46,860
to

2607
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:49,560
making commercials for SUV cars which

2608
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:53,699
yeah I find really strange yeah

2609
01:55:53,699 --> 01:55:56,699
well

2610
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:59,760
um yeah I think it's it's happening and

2611
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,440
I was considering to put another graph

2612
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,540
that shows the increase of SUV sales and

2613
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:06,840
really before 2015 it was this Market

2614
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:09,960
hardly existed it really became uh a

2615
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,480
thing in the last two years at least in

2616
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:15,179
in Western Europe I think it was a

2617
01:56:15,179 --> 01:56:16,739
little bit different in Eastern Europe

2618
01:56:16,739 --> 01:56:18,600
and Russia Ukraine

2619
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:21,360
[Music]

2620
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,400
some cultural reasons also really bad

2621
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:27,600
roads and a lot of rich people

2622
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:30,060
um but um

2623
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:32,280
okay but that seems that if you tune

2624
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,260
into the mainstream culture if you show

2625
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:36,420
TV and and advertising in between

2626
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:38,400
programs the cars are still very much

2627
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,980
there well maybe not regular cars but

2628
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:44,060
more SUVs as you say

2629
01:56:44,219 --> 01:56:45,659
um

2630
01:56:45,659 --> 01:56:47,460
I think it's an interesting observation

2631
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:50,040
anybody else has some some thoughts on

2632
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,940
this or another things

2633
01:56:54,010 --> 01:56:56,580
[Music]

2634
01:56:56,580 --> 01:57:01,739
be yeah quite hard to uh prohibit the

2635
01:57:01,739 --> 01:57:04,679
advertisements if there's no uh real

2636
01:57:04,679 --> 01:57:08,520
alternative for the car for example in

2637
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:11,119
in Flanders yeah there's an extreme

2638
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:14,580
suburbanization and it's uh Mobility is

2639
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:15,659
not

2640
01:57:15,659 --> 01:57:19,380
uh not that good to get to to different

2641
01:57:19,380 --> 01:57:23,580
places such as work or Leisure so yeah I

2642
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:26,400
think first a better alternative for the

2643
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,560
car needs to be installed

2644
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,380
and and what is that alternative

2645
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:35,219
yeah maybe better public transport

2646
01:57:35,219 --> 01:57:40,380
um safer also in cities but also in just

2647
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:46,580
Town safer uh bicycle Lanes or yeah

2648
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:52,199
and yes uh yeah car sharing more if not

2649
01:57:52,199 --> 01:57:54,420
really an alternative for cars it may be

2650
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:57,900
less having each household having two

2651
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:00,599
cars or three

2652
01:58:00,599 --> 01:58:02,280
um and in Belgium there's also the big

2653
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:03,900
problem of

2654
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:08,340
the the companies having giving cars to

2655
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:10,260
their employees

2656
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:14,159
uh which has spark debates a lot

2657
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:18,060
yes in Belgium in fact most of new cars

2658
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:19,199
being installed on so-called company

2659
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:21,119
cars which uh

2660
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:23,400
paid for by the I mean for those who

2661
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:25,860
don't know who are not from Belgium

2662
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:26,520
um

2663
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,320
it's a system that allows you to get a

2664
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:30,300
free car from your employer it's

2665
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:32,340
basically a way of giving somebody a

2666
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:36,659
salary bump because it's tax-free and

2667
01:58:36,659 --> 01:58:38,699
um bonus if you increase somebody's

2668
01:58:38,699 --> 01:58:40,440
salary they would have to pay tax on

2669
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:42,179
this you don't pay a tax on the company

2670
01:58:42,179 --> 01:58:44,040
car

2671
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:45,119
um

2672
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:48,480
but then why do you think people uh well

2673
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,580
because it seems that

2674
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:52,980
I described some some kind of a shift of

2675
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:55,139
thinking and some reflection on these

2676
01:58:55,139 --> 01:58:56,520
environmental problems that the

2677
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,679
corporate uses and all the nuisances

2678
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:00,480
that it causes but it seems that people

2679
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,820
still drive why why do you think they

2680
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:05,480
still do it

2681
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:09,020
why is it still so popular

2682
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:13,739
and maybe I can refer to this I think

2683
01:59:13,739 --> 01:59:15,719
there's like the

2684
01:59:15,719 --> 01:59:17,219
um exactly what you were talking about

2685
01:59:17,219 --> 01:59:18,960
before like

2686
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,400
um certain

2687
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:21,300
um

2688
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:24,300
yeah so

2689
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:28,440
factors which which cannot be

2690
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:29,820
um

2691
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:33,000
um somehow persist before like like

2692
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,860
urban planners cannot

2693
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:36,960
um no sorry

2694
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,480
um like certain things you cannot plan

2695
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:42,000
and like it's an individual approach

2696
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
that the symbol of the car is still like

2697
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,460
deep in the mind of a lot of people that

2698
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:52,080
they it's like a day um routine that you

2699
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:54,960
get into your car and drive to the to to

2700
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:58,199
your working place and I think that's

2701
01:59:58,199 --> 02:00:01,440
exactly the problem that it's certain

2702
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,599
um changes in the transportation system

2703
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:06,179
cannot be made by other planners or

2704
02:00:06,179 --> 02:00:09,960
transport Transportation planners but

2705
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:13,260
um have to be made in in in the society

2706
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:17,699
or in the in symbolism of of a car so

2707
02:00:17,699 --> 02:00:20,580
it's a mindset it's a cultural

2708
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:23,280
habitus sociologists would say it's a

2709
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:26,400
way of imagining how we interact with uh

2710
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:29,159
with the world or how we move through it

2711
02:00:29,159 --> 02:00:30,599
but I think the example of the company

2712
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:33,239
car also shows that something else it's

2713
02:00:33,239 --> 02:00:36,000
not exclusive but it's also a policy

2714
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,800
that there are a number of political

2715
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:40,619
instruments that make it uh

2716
02:00:40,619 --> 02:00:44,699
I mean if we go with that uh

2717
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:47,219
simplified logic of making a rational

2718
02:00:47,219 --> 02:00:50,699
economic choice uh how do I go and where

2719
02:00:50,699 --> 02:00:52,679
do I go it simply makes this decision

2720
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:55,619
more more simple more rational it makes

2721
02:00:55,619 --> 02:00:58,440
sense to have a car from an economic

2722
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:00,659
perspective as well in in many cities

2723
02:01:00,659 --> 02:01:03,060
still

2724
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:05,119
um

2725
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,179
yeah if I could maybe add to that also

2726
02:01:09,179 --> 02:01:11,280
that's structurally there is a lot of

2727
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:13,679
government as well like policy support

2728
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:16,020
not just like the company cars but as we

2729
02:01:16,020 --> 02:01:18,900
saw these days with the crisis I think

2730
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:22,139
we try to boost like not to to allow our

2731
02:01:22,139 --> 02:01:24,540
automobile manufacturing automobile

2732
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:25,920
companies

2733
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:27,719
um Cromwell because of the employment

2734
02:01:27,719 --> 02:01:29,639
opportunities that they provide so

2735
02:01:29,639 --> 02:01:31,920
strangely enough actually some of the

2736
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,619
financial

2737
02:01:33,619 --> 02:01:36,599
loss or some of the new

2738
02:01:36,599 --> 02:01:39,000
um funds for to stimulate the economy

2739
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,520
have been directly towards I think

2740
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:44,820
Individual Car ownership purchase of

2741
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:47,159
different people so I think when you

2742
02:01:47,159 --> 02:01:49,800
when you see that it's

2743
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:53,159
it's a big imperative a big push if if

2744
02:01:53,159 --> 02:01:56,340
you can have access to that as well yeah

2745
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:58,739
I think same goes with Aviation I don't

2746
02:01:58,739 --> 02:02:00,300
know if you follow that on the news but

2747
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:03,119
one of the first maybe not first but one

2748
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:04,679
of the early discussions in terms of

2749
02:02:04,679 --> 02:02:08,340
some economic package for stimulating

2750
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:10,380
the the economy in Belgium was towards

2751
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:13,020
the the aviation companies the argument

2752
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:14,940
being is that these industries create

2753
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:18,659
jobs and these jobs are valuable

2754
02:02:18,659 --> 02:02:20,159
well

2755
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:21,599
um I'm not saying whether this is right

2756
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:22,170
or wrong

2757
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:23,400
[Music]

2758
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:25,920
but the argument is there that these

2759
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,360
modes of Mobility also produce

2760
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,679
employment

2761
02:02:28,679 --> 02:02:30,360
I think that relates a little bit to

2762
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:32,699
this aspect of Economic Development this

2763
02:02:32,699 --> 02:02:34,800
anticipation that you know since this

2764
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,599
way of moving around our cities or our

2765
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:39,000
Societies in general uh is very

2766
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
important for the economy to to to keep

2767
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,699
growing to keep persisting

2768
02:02:44,699 --> 02:02:46,080
um

2769
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:47,940
are there any other comments maybe from

2770
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:50,820
some people who haven't spoken yet

2771
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:52,800
you have some thoughts

2772
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,139
some comments

2773
02:02:55,139 --> 02:02:56,639
um I was also thinking about security

2774
02:02:56,639 --> 02:02:58,380
like

2775
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:01,320
um the the use of the car is still

2776
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:04,080
um like yeah done by many because maybe

2777
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,179
it's the last like it's the most secure

2778
02:03:06,179 --> 02:03:09,360
way of moving around in some cities and

2779
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:11,880
also like I'm thinking and like as a

2780
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:13,739
woman as a girl like moving around the

2781
02:03:13,739 --> 02:03:16,260
city at night usually like um I mean not

2782
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:17,940
here in Brussels because I don't have a

2783
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:20,520
car here in Brussels like back home

2784
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:23,219
um I would go by car at night

2785
02:03:23,219 --> 02:03:25,560
um just because like

2786
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:27,480
um yeah it's not very secure to move

2787
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:30,119
around uh with like public transport or

2788
02:03:30,119 --> 02:03:32,219
even by bike so I would say like yeah

2789
02:03:32,219 --> 02:03:34,500
it's it's a matter of security as well

2790
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:36,060
and

2791
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:39,000
um it's more like a structural problem

2792
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,119
uh to change so I guess more steps have

2793
02:03:42,119 --> 02:03:44,099
to be taken in that sense

2794
02:03:44,099 --> 02:03:47,520
yeah it's a very good point it existed

2795
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,460
before the pandemic and now it's uh it's

2796
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:53,699
become even more more of an issue so

2797
02:03:53,699 --> 02:03:56,880
early data uh shows us that uh

2798
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,619
especially the upper middle class or

2799
02:03:58,619 --> 02:04:00,540
upper class people have uh have bought

2800
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:02,699
themselves a new car to uh to separate

2801
02:04:02,699 --> 02:04:05,159
themselves from the from the danger of

2802
02:04:05,159 --> 02:04:07,440
interacting with others earlier this

2803
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:08,880
danger would be related to maybe

2804
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:11,520
criminality or general lack of safety

2805
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:14,159
especially at night especially for women

2806
02:04:14,159 --> 02:04:17,159
perhaps but now this sense of danger and

2807
02:04:17,159 --> 02:04:18,480
the car is this kind of bubble that

2808
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:19,980
allows you to separate yourself from

2809
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:23,159
whatever danger Society holds it's it's

2810
02:04:23,159 --> 02:04:25,750
even stronger

2811
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:26,280
[Music]

2812
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:27,080
um

2813
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:30,480
I think what's important also uh we will

2814
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:33,659
talk about this a lot uh next time is

2815
02:04:33,659 --> 02:04:35,580
that this goes very differently for for

2816
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:37,020
different people I mean it sounds very

2817
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:40,500
obvious but uh whether you look at the

2818
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:42,060
situation from a class perspective or

2819
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:43,560
from a gender perspective or from a

2820
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:45,199
racial perspective

2821
02:04:45,199 --> 02:04:48,420
I think all these three uh also age is

2822
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:50,219
very important all these four then apply

2823
02:04:50,219 --> 02:04:51,599
in Brussels very much

2824
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:54,480
uh the way that people arrive to a

2825
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,580
decision in terms of why they go where

2826
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:58,980
they go and how they go it's it's very

2827
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:00,960
different from class to class from

2828
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,699
gender to gender and

2829
02:05:02,699 --> 02:05:04,080
etc etc

2830
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:07,500
so this homo economicus Paradigm is

2831
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:11,159
extremely problematic there but so is I

2832
02:05:11,159 --> 02:05:14,699
hope I will convince you of that this uh

2833
02:05:14,699 --> 02:05:18,239
direct critique uh of the car because uh

2834
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:19,320
different people use the car for

2835
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:22,199
different reasons and not always it's a

2836
02:05:22,199 --> 02:05:24,360
individual choice but also there are

2837
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:28,199
some structural issues at play uh also

2838
02:05:28,199 --> 02:05:32,520
indeed some cultural inertia some ways

2839
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,380
of being that were installed and

2840
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:38,520
promoted for decades which now we are or

2841
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:39,540
some of us

2842
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:41,840
living in City centers

2843
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:44,520
are critical of but things have things

2844
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,320
are quite different if you're uh from a

2845
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:47,520
different class and living in different

2846
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,159
areas of the city

2847
02:05:50,159 --> 02:05:52,080
um I don't mind taking one more or two

2848
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:54,540
more questions but it's eight already so

2849
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:56,400
we are very free to leave if you want to

2850
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,139
I don't want to take too much of your

2851
02:05:58,139 --> 02:06:00,320
time

2852
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:03,860
well

2853
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:05,940
great

2854
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:07,860
um I'm glad this is working from the

2855
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:09,960
technical perspective at least

2856
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:15,139
yeah I will uh I will see you next week

2857
02:06:19,460 --> 02:06:22,560
that we have program I know that in

2858
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,440
covet times Well it's not happening but

2859
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:28,440
no no I was I was told that uh yeah yeah

2860
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:30,300
I was uh

2861
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:32,219
was trying to do it but uh it's not

2862
02:06:32,219 --> 02:06:34,020
possible unfortunately I wish we could

2863
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:36,119
and do it the idea is for those of you

2864
02:06:36,119 --> 02:06:37,920
who are in Brussels next semester but

2865
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,560
all of you will be right

2866
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:41,480
um

2867
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:43,340
well

2868
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:45,420
I mean

2869
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:46,980
um let's say

2870
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:48,060
[Music]

2871
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:49,860
well we don't know of course what

2872
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:51,179
happens in a few months but the idea is

2873
02:06:51,179 --> 02:06:54,719
that if in Spring we are more or less to

2874
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:57,060
you know more into face-to-face meetings

2875
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:58,860
than we do the Excursion then

2876
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:01,380
we imagined with David bus and others

2877
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:02,699
what would happen if we meet with 40

2878
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:05,159
people and try to keep distance I think

2879
02:07:05,159 --> 02:07:06,659
this would uh you know we would hit

2880
02:07:06,659 --> 02:07:08,699
YouTube very quickly I think trying to

2881
02:07:08,699 --> 02:07:10,080
walk through the city in this

2882
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,040
arrangement

2883
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,719
so

2884
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:15,119
no and also in December I mean it would

2885
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:17,639
be very strange uh from my experience in

2886
02:07:17,639 --> 02:07:19,500
the end we would definitely try to keep

2887
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:21,780
together just to keep warm it's it's

2888
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:24,420
cold right so

2889
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:26,159
um we will do that in Spring I hope it's

2890
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:29,099
a nice Excursion uh from what I've heard

2891
02:07:29,099 --> 02:07:31,619
uh people usually enjoy it

2892
02:07:31,619 --> 02:07:34,520
um even though it's only about transport

2893
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,780
but yeah uh

2894
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:38,820
uh I'm sorry about that I wish I wish we

2895
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:40,920
could do it yeah this is the reality

2896
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:43,520
we're living in

2897
02:07:44,099 --> 02:07:46,440
um I hope you care of a great rest of

2898
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,840
the week I'll see you all next week uh

2899
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:50,699
the links are there so it seems that

2900
02:07:50,699 --> 02:07:52,560
everything is clear and working so

2901
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:54,719
that's brilliant

2902
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:57,960
um enjoy and have a good have a good

2903
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:59,400
