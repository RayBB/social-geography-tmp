1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,200
yes

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:10,320
I've done my best now to restart the

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,179
stream

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,920
maybe you can ask whether it's it's

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,279
working it's difficult for me to check

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,960
I thought I had been doing what I've

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
been doing last week it seemed to work

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,840
then

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,199
but um also for those who use the

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,660
streams to to study

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,420
I think it makes more sense to use last

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,020
year's stream also for today's lecture

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,579
for those who are following now because

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,340
I I prefer to teach for the ones here

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,399
meaning that I will be in front of my

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,910
screen I should also put that on again

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,840
[Music]

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,559
um

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,260
or in between in the classroom and that

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,539
will not be recorded and last year I've

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,579
just been streaming from my office

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,260
because we were not

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,020
supposed to have lectures anymore so I

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,760
feel that it's better to

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,520
for all the last year's team and also

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,979
for the ones who can't be here today but

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,500
also in case you want to study the

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,460
slides are 1990 99 the same

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,220
so um I think it makes more sense to use

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,340
last year's live stream also for last

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,400
week's class

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,380
thank you

33
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,299
um

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,280
do you have any information about the

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,759
stream now

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,259
you think it's working

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,740
okay and I'll I'll do my best to

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,400
move it in that direction

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
um

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,820
okay so let's suppose that the stream is

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,740
working

42
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,740
if not everyone can rely on last year's

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,600
team

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,340
um

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,560
okay I think quite many of you are here

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,299
like I don't know how many students have

47
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,640
expected to have I think 70 or 80

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,540
percent this year

49
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,060
um could the ideal of social mix so I I

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,600
told you already I told you already that

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,360
in many cities across the world there

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,819
has been a concern with segregation it

53
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,640
has been supposed that segregation has

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
negative effects

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
on uh poor people for example and that

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,379
you're worse off when you're poor when

57
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,780
you're living in a neighborhood where

58
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,080
with a concentration of poverty

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,660
rather than in a mixed neighborhood

60
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,660
where you have both Working Class People

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,800
and another philosophy

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,980
um already in the 19th century in the

63
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,239
hey days of the Industrial Revolution

64
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,239
um you have very different groups

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,819
um the capitalistic bourgeoisie and the

66
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,400
utopian socialists yeah so both the

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,519
Bourgeois and the Socialists who were

68
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,080
afraid

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,080
or who were thinking that

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,840
um concentrations of laborers in

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,540
particular neighborhoods of the city for

72
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,580
example here in Brussels in modern Bay

73
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,400
at that time or an antwer in um and for

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,440
the good house but this would have

75
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,659
negative effects

76
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,140
and the bourgeoisie was afraid that

77
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,959
concentrations of laborers might lead to

78
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
Revolutions

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
that socialist thinking would become

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,319
dominant with these neighborhoods and

81
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,940
that you would never report that people

82
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,360
would get on the streets okay and the

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,080
utopian socialists they were scared that

84
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,620
um

85
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,760
this these concentrations of laborers

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,540
would

87
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,879
um make it more difficult to strive for

88
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,980
an egalitarian society

89
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,680
and so on both ends of the political

90
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,360
Spectrum you had people who were

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,760
thinking that in places such as

92
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,799
Manchester or ginto Brussels where you

93
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,319
have these new uh working class

94
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,200
neighborhoods that this was something

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,739
bad to be counteracted

96
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,900
this ideal is still very dominant

97
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,280
nowadays

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,799
and here you see a quote

99
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,110
from

100
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,560
[Music]

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,858
well the Brussels Capital Region quite

102
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,500
an old one but I think current policy

103
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,320
documents you would find similar quotes

104
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,120
stating that contrary to the American

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,180
city the ideal type for the European

106
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,419
city is based on a mix of functions and

107
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,500
people

108
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,240
I think it's important to make a

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,639
distinction between these two things on

110
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,919
the one hand they refer to a functional

111
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,759
mix meaning that they would like to

112
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,560
strive for neighborhoods where you have

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,900
a mix of the residential function

114
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,720
apartments and houses

115
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,220
and for example offices

116
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,340
or shops saying that well it's not good

117
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,040
to have neighborhoods where you only

118
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,060
have

119
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,460
a residential friction and other

120
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,020
neighborhoods where you only have

121
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,699
offices

122
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,060
and so we strive for

123
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,620
Brussels with neighborhoods where you

124
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,900
have a functional mix

125
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,000
yeah but then the other thing this is

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,820
what we are interested in today is

127
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,660
saying well we also want Brussels like

128
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,000
other European cities to have

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,660
neighborhoods with a mix of people poor

130
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,360
people and rich people

131
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,039
and in Brussels there have been many

132
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,060
different moments where this

133
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,759
this topic of social mix has been

134
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,080
agenda

135
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,840
I think those of you

136
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,780
have not arrive to vessels only a month

137
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,360
ago I might have heard of these

138
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,820
discussions around Creator books the

139
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,740
social housing Estates on my list

140
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,120
so in the periphery of the Brussels

141
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,419
Capital Region and therefore yeah quite

142
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,720
some media reports about crime

143
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,060
yeah and then the issue of well you have

144
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,500
all these

145
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,060
to be

146
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,639
accommodated on the social housing

147
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,160
estate in uh in Brussels and in Belgium

148
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,340
more generally you need to fall below a

149
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,500
certain income

150
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,039
stressful yeah meaning that it's mainly

151
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,860
the poorest of the poor that you will

152
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,720
concentrate on these social housing

153
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,120
instance

154
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,280
and so then you had discussions well is

155
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,639
that a good thing is this not leading to

156
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,240
this culture where crime is uh or common

157
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,660
and conservative politicians would raise

158
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,520
this kind of dog service

159
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,440
Progressive politicians would wonder

160
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,919
well is that then a neighborhood where

161
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,319
it is easy for poor people to climb the

162
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,380
social network wouldn't it be easier to

163
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,259
be socially mobile when you are not only

164
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,500
surrounded by other poor people but when

165
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,680
you are living between poor and rich

166
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,160
people alive

167
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,680
a neighborhood in underlift and

168
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,620
obviously also in the wake of these

169
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,639
terrorist attacks in 2015 there were a

170
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,039
lot of concerns also in the

171
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,360
international league

172
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
about more of me and there were reports

173
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,000
about more than make as difficult as a

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,139
ghetto

175
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,199
it's been looking at the statistics

176
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,120
I think

177
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,060
is the municipality most

178
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,680
people of Moroccan and origin the

179
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,620
boost followers of Islam but it's still

180
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,419
less than half

181
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,180
so in the in international media it was

182
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,300
often reported as this model made was a

183
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
municipality with only

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
uh

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,599
Moroccan

186
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,900
people and people of Moroccan Origins

187
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,759
and when you look at the statistics that

188
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,919
was not the case nonetheless

189
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,220
they were concerns hopefully but also

190
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,080
conditionally

191
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,759
um about mobile Bank being a safe haven

192
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,919
for terrorists and breeding graph or

193
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,639
there

194
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,580
are affected you have this concentration

195
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,640
of people of the same origin was

196
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,599
then the reason to be to be concerned

197
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,200
so both when it comes social Mobility

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,539
and when it comes to

199
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,920
cultural integration and newcomers there

200
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,040
are concerns in a city such as Brussels

201
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,459
about the concentration of either people

202
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,940
or people of foreign origin these are

203
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,480
two different issues social mobility and

204
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,959
social cultural integration and so I

205
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,920
hint was there a question

206
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
um

207
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,440
no I am I'm trying to explain you

208
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,600
I'm not saying that there is that these

209
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,240
are examples one is the social picks but

210
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,100
I'm trying to explain you that in many

211
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,200
cities across the roads and I will start

212
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,779
from a couple of religion examples this

213
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,000
ideal or social mix is high on the

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,279
political object and I'm referring to

215
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,519
this paper boss issue and modern-day

216
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,500
after the pillars the text has two

217
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,080
moments where social mixtures highly

218
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,080
debated local media and in the case of

219
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,700
these terrorist attacks also is

220
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,940
international

221
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,080
um Brussels we moved to Ghent

222
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,540
and a former colleague of mine

223
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,519
has written a nice book about

224
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,940
gentrification

225
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,040
his name is

226
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,720
so for those who know the Dutch who are

227
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,360
interested in a piece of things they

228
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,220
they find some interesting literature

229
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,940
there

230
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,880
and you see a quote from an elder man of

231
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,440
the City of Kent

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
uh talking about for those who know

233
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,360
neighborhoods such as Bridge support

234
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,560
neighborhoods that have a similar

235
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,640
history

236
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,000
as modern big in Brussels or

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,680
um

238
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,200
in Antwerp neighborhoods that have

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,800
developed in this 19th century

240
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,620
industrial industrialization

241
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,000
and

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,240
um so neighborhoods with

243
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,740
um

244
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,500
higher than average percentage of

245
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,899
unemployment higher than average

246
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,899
percentage of people also a higher than

247
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,680
average percentage of people of foreign

248
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,740
what was this elder man saying well when

249
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,220
I attract young families

250
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,740
preferably with a job preferably double

251
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,339
income families that will improve my

252
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,600
social tissue

253
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,060
my textbooks and my neighborhood life

254
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,399
I think these are different concerns the

255
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,839
tech space

256
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,360
is something something important I'm

257
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,360
sorry I'm in Belgium about 40 to 50

258
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,540
percent of the municipal budget comes

259
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,720
from local Texas most of it is a

260
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,420
percentage on the local income tax and

261
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,519
percentage on the

262
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,579
um on the income tax meaning that if you

263
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,860
have more rich people in your

264
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,800
municipality that you will have a higher

265
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,700
Municipal budget

266
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,800
and the other part comes from lent and

267
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,720
house value

268
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,300
um but so why does this elder man again

269
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,420
find or that attract young families

270
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,399
preferably with a joke

271
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,940
middle class of the white families is to

272
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,399
improve this local Tech space to have

273
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,019
more budget for the city of cats but on

274
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,700
top of that

275
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,920
he's saying it's also important to

276
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,240
improve my social tissue and I will go

277
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,540
further into that but often there the

278
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,060
underlying thought is that for example

279
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,060
when you have rich and poor people then

280
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,140
you have

281
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,540
families with the job and families

282
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,820
without a job that you will get diverse

283
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,640
social networks for example and then in

284
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,579
these networks jobs can be found or

285
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,220
people can be helped with homework Etc

286
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,399
and so this

287
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,160
ID for the importance to attract young

288
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,220
families prefer preferably connections

289
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,060
it's not only for to improved Tech space

290
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,060
of the city but also to improve the

291
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,920
social tissue and neighborhood life

292
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,920
in very much a similar way and we moved

293
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,800
to the city of Antwerp and we have been

294
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,579
visiting this undcredible port

295
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,079
neighborhoods the neighborhood where I

296
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,380
think 25 of the newcomers in Antwerp

297
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,500
passed through before moving to other

298
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,360
parts of the city and neighborhood that

299
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,579
is quite similar to this transition zone

300
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,399
that Burgess was describing in 19th

301
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,380
century Chicago

302
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,540
and I've been talking there about a lot

303
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,800
of regulations

304
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,459
and then affected shopkeepers in the

305
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,820
neighborhood but also

306
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,060
regulations that concern the subdivision

307
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,860
of houses

308
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,760
and you see there that in the previous

309
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,639
governance agreement in Antwerp it was

310
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,459
stated that the city wants a larger

311
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,000
share of single-family dwellings in this

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,339
particular neighborhood in the housing

313
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,000
Supply in order to attract families I

314
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,399
always find it interesting to see this

315
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,220
kind of words often youngsters means

316
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,700
young people or foreigners what you see

317
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,860
here is that families is used to call

318
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,180
this mantis

319
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,200
double income families often wide

320
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,300
structures so that is why the

321
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,220
transformation of single-family

322
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,279
dwellings into smaller housing entities

323
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,040
is not desirable and for those who join

324
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,320
to enter we have been discussing how

325
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,959
could you support the arrival function

326
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,480
in this neighborhood well when people

327
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,579
are looking for a very cheap place to

328
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,220
live and they will rent a room for even

329
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,079
just a mattress

330
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,000
and that's what they look for the

331
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,120
cheapest roof above their heads what you

332
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,639
see here is that the city of Antwerp is

333
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,160
not supporting the Bible version but

334
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,360
finds it important to bring another kind

335
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,500
of people uh to this neighborhood namely

336
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,480
richer families

337
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,180
so again you see efforts here

338
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,680
to

339
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,940
um

340
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,940
to earn this unto elephant North into a

341
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,740
socially mixed neighborhood where you

342
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,959
have newcomers next to uh white families

343
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,480
who can afford

344
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,019
to buy such a big house

345
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,139
just for for the use of one of one

346
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,320
family

347
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,300
in the art in the article by Tom Slater

348
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,779
and you've also seen references to

349
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,180
the situation in the UK

350
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,420
and the United States and and he refers

351
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,860
to this housing market renewal projects

352
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,720
where

353
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,420
um different in different parts of the

354
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,639
country

355
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,680
neighborhoods which were mainly

356
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,160
inhabited by poor people often poor

357
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,500
people of foreign origin you had

358
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,380
demolition projects and you had the

359
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,980
creation of new dwellings that tried to

360
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,600
cater for different audiences

361
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,760
and again you see the

362
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,120
this is a quote from the artist later

363
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,959
you see that the ID was that

364
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,980
um in these neighborhoods that have been

365
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,220
transformed uh that the inhabitants the

366
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,740
people who used to live there were

367
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,320
seriously disadvantaged by where they

368
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,680
lived and the idea was that living in

369
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,560
such a neighborhood being poor in such a

370
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,660
neighborhood

371
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,259
accessor based poverty makes it worse

372
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,180
about basically living in such a

373
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,339
neighborhood is worse than living in

374
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,480
another name

375
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,759
and that it will be more difficult to

376
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,040
find out of poverty in such a

377
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,100
neighborhood other parts of the city so

378
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,480
for this reason I was a big problem and

379
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,020
project to basically demolish much of

380
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,419
the housing in these neighborhoods and

381
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,540
to build new houses that catered for

382
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,500
different audiences

383
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,040
um Slater also refers to this hope six

384
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,520
program in the UK and the U.S sorry

385
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,059
for example Cabrini Green a neighborhood

386
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,760
a couple of miles to the north of the

387
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,820
loop in Chicago last week I've been

388
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,400
talking quite a bit about Chicago a

389
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,380
neighborhood with a very bad reputation

390
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,539
for drug use

391
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,020
and many crime and many other things

392
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,960
and again what has been done there is

393
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,640
that many of these

394
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,820
apartment books have been torn down have

395
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,539
been demolished and that

396
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,120
you houses have been built again trying

397
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,640
to cater for another kind of it's trying

398
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,460
to bring the middle class to a

399
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,860
neighborhood that was previously mainly

400
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,380
inhabited

401
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,559
and then in the separation of the PS you

402
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,299
might have heard of this function system

403
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,600
where many of the original residents of

404
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,460
the neighborhood such as that brother

405
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,700
voucher and basically to give them a

406
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,140
discount on

407
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,860
their parents price in other parts of

408
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,440
the city trying to encourage them to

409
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,500
move to better off

410
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,039
neighborhoods in other parts of Chicago

411
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,220
so again you see attempts to mix

412
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,380
neighborhoods

413
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,559
in the conviction that the concentration

414
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,580
of poverty is bad that it leads to crime

415
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,000
and it leads to drug use and that it is

416
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,840
bad for these inhabitants

417
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,580
South Africa

418
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,880
yeah

419
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,980
well I think the outcome

420
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,580
um

421
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,740
there are many many papers about this

422
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,960
and many scholars are looking at

423
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,780
different sites of this metal

424
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,860
but

425
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,580
um

426
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,520
I think in the article by Tom Slater and

427
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,679
page

428
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,039
369 I see here it is stated that No

429
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,500
Effects have been reported for a number

430
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,240
of outcomes

431
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
and that adverse effects on the delete

432
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
delinquency

433
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,919
and physical health of

434
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,679
um adolescent males in particular have

435
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,000
been reported

436
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,520
um but positive effects on adult mental

437
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,679
health and education and health of young

438
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,440
women so it depends very much

439
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,059
what you're looking at

440
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,919
but in any case

441
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,380
studies who tried and to find out like

442
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,720
what happened to the people who moved to

443
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,539
middle class neighborhoods and found

444
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,780
fairly adverse effects and in any case

445
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,020
one good question whether such a

446
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,260
well because the

447
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,120
project

448
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,720
was the best one to try and improve the

449
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,480
situation of poor people in Chicago

450
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,340
yeah

451
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,559
I will discuss the the effects of such

452
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,080
programs in more detail but before doing

453
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,240
that I wanted to highlight that in many

454
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,360
countries across the world us UK many

455
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,679
Belgian cities

456
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,860
and basically all over Western Europe in

457
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,500
South Africa

458
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,360
attends have been made to create

459
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,340
socially mixed neighborhoods in the

460
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,100
conviction that's a segregation as a

461
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,039
concentration of poverty is bad for

462
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,919
people living in uh

463
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,340
foreign

464
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,919
[Music]

465
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,980
of projects that you see here are about

466
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,140
bringing the middle class to

467
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,260
neighborhoods which used to be uh

468
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,919
predominantly predominantly

469
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,000
dysfunction program that I was just

470
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
talking about is also doing the other

471
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,320
way in doing it the other way around

472
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,679
because it tries to bring poor people

473
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,679
um to middle class neighborhoods so this

474
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,140
is also a project where

475
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,419
middle class neighborhoods are also

476
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,520
becoming more more mixed

477
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,740
because by giving these rent subsidies

478
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,240
through this voucher system it allows

479
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,799
people

480
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,240
underprivileged people to move to a

481
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,600
better of parts of the city as well

482
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,059
but I will I will come back to that

483
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:03,659
um

484
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,400
for now

485
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,960
well

486
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,539
we it's good that you already started

487
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,280
wondering about every

488
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,419
ethical difference

489
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,640
but as I said for now it's it's

490
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,799
important that you see that

491
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,080
in many parts in many corners of the

492
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,760
world this

493
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,600
um ideal of socially mixed socially

494
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,080
mixed neighborhoods seems to be a very

495
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,919
stable kind of idea

496
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,559
and it's very predominant among policy

497
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,460
makers both on the left and on the right

498
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,320
so on both ends of the political

499
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,360
Spectrum you find this pretty poor

500
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,820
neighborhoods that house people of

501
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,419
different origins or people of different

502
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,820
socio-economic efforts

503
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,100
two questions we need to ask about this

504
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,760
is it possible then to create social

505
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,120
indexed mixed neighborhoods and then

506
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,520
third and is it or second the second

507
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,340
question is it a desirable to do that

508
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,140
and

509
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,740
the article white illustrator gives or

510
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,559
turns later gives in this article a very

511
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,940
clear answer

512
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,120
referring to this whole six

513
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,960
program in the United States and housing

514
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,320
markets renewal in the UK is stating

515
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,940
that what have they done they have

516
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,919
basically just shifted over the

517
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,740
elsewhere this has not been a remedy to

518
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,140
Poverty this has just made poor people

519
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,380
elsewhere in the city

520
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,460
the mode of production that shapes Urban

521
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,020
environments which we live

522
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,659
it's referring to the capitalistic

523
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,260
system there the system of the the mode

524
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,919
of production of capitalism

525
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
produces concentrations of poverty that

526
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,760
many

527
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,780
policy makers as we have seen rejoice in

528
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,840
breaking up yet that same mode of

529
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,620
production churning intact produces

530
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,500
further concentrations just down the

531
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,280
street

532
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,179
I still remember one of my former

533
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,580
professors saying that well many of

534
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,280
these attempts to create socially mixed

535
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,100
neighborhoods by attracting middle class

536
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,440
people

537
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,000
to

538
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,400
for example poor neighborhoods

539
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,500
in Brussels has just shifted this

540
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,340
poverty elsewhere and for that reason he

541
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,360
um

542
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,840
he made this comparison with moving

543
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,179
chairs on the deck of the Titanic people

544
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:51,059
remain poor that you just make them move

545
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,260
somewhere else but this does not

546
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,880
improve their socio-economic position

547
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,820
this does not help them to climb to

548
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,760
social media in in the text 5 and again

549
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,220
all you've also also seen this reference

550
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,260
to water but

551
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,100
oops

552
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,840
so when you look at that

553
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,419
um it it seems to be very hard to create

554
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,100
a social mix

555
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,460
yeah the same goes for Brussels I've

556
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,000
been referring to this article by

557
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,580
material by clicking already in chapter

558
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,799
one

559
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,919
um and basically what mature has been

560
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,580
doing is to study people moving out of

561
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,860
gentrifying neighborhoods in bristles

562
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,640
what happens to people who move out of

563
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,039
neighborhoods in Brussels that are

564
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,140
gentrified

565
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,360
and basically he made a distinction

566
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,900
between different clusters of people and

567
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,659
if I'm correct then cluster one

568
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,059
consisted mainly of Highly Educated

569
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,000
young professionals where do they move

570
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,520
as neighborhoods in Brussels gentrified

571
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,559
they move to Antwerp and Yash and also

572
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,559
some of the municipalities of rabba one

573
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,559
law and these are municipalities

574
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,080
these people find a joke in another city

575
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,720
in another part of Belgium they move out

576
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,580
of this gentrifying neighborhoods and

577
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,419
they

578
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,940
move to a place closer to the place

579
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,880
where they cook and that's where it is

580
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,500
cluster two

581
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,039
consisted of more working philosophy

582
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,700
last people with a lower than average

583
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,980
income where do they move

584
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,679
first of all to

585
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,120
um

586
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,260
well municipalities along the canal

587
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,740
and such as Holland and hillford

588
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,200
I don't know how familiar all of you are

589
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,240
with the geography of Belgium already

590
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,000
but these are also municipalities small

591
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,340
towns that have gone through a process

592
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,380
of industrialization and where you will

593
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,960
find small houses that will be cheaper

594
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,539
than the houses you would find in these

595
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,240
gentrified team records in Brussels yeah

596
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,120
so what you see here is that

597
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,340
gentrification comes with displacement

598
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,039
for example through a municipality such

599
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,820
as Villanova

600
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,559
but as you see these clusters you can

601
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,559
find rather far from Brussels

602
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,240
many

603
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,980
towns cities in this 19th century built

604
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,380
of industrialization in person in

605
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,960
Belgium so these are municipalities

606
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,500
where you would find housing or a rather

607
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,419
cheap price

608
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,179
yeah so if you follow material by

609
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,580
clicking his arguments then you would

610
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,580
see well what happens here is that by

611
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,000
trying to improve

612
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,720
the lives of poor people in Brussels

613
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,900
through creating the social mix

614
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,299
attracting the middle class to these

615
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,940
neighborhoods what you see is that these

616
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,220
people move

617
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,960
are displaced to other municipalities

618
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,440
they also have concentrations of poor

619
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,299
people that but they are located in much

620
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,820
worse situations locations when it comes

621
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,520
to finding a job

622
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,279
and so what is happening here this is

623
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,679
Shifting the chairs on the deck of the

624
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,159
Titanic poverty still exists but by

625
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,080
attracting the middle class to some

626
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,179
neighborhoods or Brussels you move

627
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,940
poverty elsewhere

628
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,640
to places where people can afford to

629
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,600
live

630
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,299
and these are

631
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,559
neighborhoods that we have been visiting

632
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,440
in inshallah for example

633
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,740
where buying a house or renting an

634
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,320
apartment will be much cheaper than at

635
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,299
least in in section or some of the other

636
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:12,200
gentrifying parts of Brussels

637
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,480
this map shows something very similar

638
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,580
for Android

639
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,880
those who join to antler might recognize

640
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,120
its first ring the medieval answer the

641
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,360
second ring

642
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,539
19th century industrial antler

643
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,059
um and what it what is not

644
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,059
um

645
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:39,600
visualizes is a synthesis index of this

646
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,520
advantage and you see that in some

647
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,700
neighborhoods there are no big changes

648
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,220
uh in the last years in this index they

649
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,779
are yellow

650
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:50,940
for example Louis ball

651
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,100
social housing Estates that we have

652
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,620
visited remains yellow situation there

653
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,480
does not really change

654
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,360
you also see other parts of the city

655
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,000
for example a luncheon

656
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,179
at the area around the museum that we

657
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,340
have been growing up

658
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,520
you see that this is blue yeah and many

659
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,120
of the inner city neighborhoods in

660
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,779
entrepreneurs for example are also blue

661
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,100
yeah

662
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,440
at the same time you see that other

663
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,260
parts of the city for example medicine

664
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,840
outside of this 19th century well that

665
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,659
you see a worsening of the synthesis

666
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:37,740
that's also here through this map you

667
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,440
could see that well some neighborhoods

668
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,600
are attracting or middle class people

669
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,559
but poverty is shifted elsewhere in the

670
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,140
city is moving to other parts of the

671
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,380
urban region and this map is just uh

672
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,480
giving you the situation for the

673
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,179
municipality of the city of Antwerp but

674
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,580
if you would include the whole province

675
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,100
of that or you might see that for

676
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,559
example

677
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,600
for people who know culture

678
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,580
um

679
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,340
the Drupal region

680
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,460
we have display factories factors in the

681
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,980
past that you would see a worsening of

682
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,419
the situation

683
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,659
so we can try to attract middle class

684
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,820
people that's what the city of Ventura

685
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,980
Pacific building you can try to attract

686
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,740
the middle classes back to the city

687
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,159
but this displaces

688
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,440
people from these neighborhoods who

689
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,600
cannot afford to live there anymore so

690
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,260
this moves over the elsewhere

691
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,260
Russian

692
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,299
well I I'm a submitted I don't know all

693
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,880
the applications in this in the specific

694
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,299
index but I guess it will be about

695
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:58,760
average income

696
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,020
unemployment and maybe some other

697
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,539
complicators that say something about

698
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,679
this thing

699
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,059
um but I should have I should have put

700
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,059
so much of what we see here

701
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,640
confirms this ID of Slater when clicking

702
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,740
in that well trying to create a social

703
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,000
mix in some parts of the city will

704
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,360
shift poverty will make poverty move

705
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,240
elsewhere I will create

706
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,360
that's what Slater said will create

707
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,520
other concentrations

708
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,440
of poverty this is just down the street

709
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,059
inshallahua for the case of this

710
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,760
gentrifying neighborhoods Over Us in

711
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,520
bone for This Ginger flying so that's

712
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,640
verb in medicine in government in other

713
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,860
parts of these Urban regions

714
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,600
there are examples in the world where

715
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,700
mixed neighborhoods are being created

716
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,980
but that is only possible

717
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,419
when City councils or governments can

718
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,880
have a serious impact

719
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,659
open

720
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,460
upon who's living in in specific

721
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,200
neighborhoods

722
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,640
um in some parts of the world

723
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,640
um Scholars write about inclusionary

724
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,299
housing or inclusionary zoning

725
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,539
forcing for example real estate

726
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:36,539
developers who develop a high tower full

727
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:37,919
of apartments

728
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,539
to

729
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:40,200
um

730
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,919
dedicates a certain percentage of these

731
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,039
residents residential units to people

732
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,140
who fall below a certain income

733
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,519
threshold

734
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,460
and so you can create

735
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,120
a socially mixed neighborhood

736
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,159
if you force

737
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,679
real estate Developers

738
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,059
to

739
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,380
um

740
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,740
well in in newly built projects

741
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,699
to have a certain percentage of

742
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,739
Apartments of for people of a certain if

743
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,139
they fall below a certain inconsistent

744
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,540
in Antwerp I've been talking about this

745
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,460
caltex neighborhood

746
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,339
this was the length of the port in

747
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:30,540
public hands and so the city council

748
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,500
could also sell this land to Developers

749
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,918
with a lot of conditions and so

750
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,399
developers could buy this lens under the

751
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:46,500
condition that's that they built 25 of

752
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,839
the residential units for social housing

753
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:55,159
15 rent 10 to buy and that they

754
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,099
reserved 50 of the units at affordable

755
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,480
prices

756
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,599
and that was not fairly affordable but

757
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,700
at least you could not ask whatever you

758
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,160
wanted these prices could not Skyrocket

759
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,099
could not ask whatever you wanted for

760
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,280
these residential units and so you could

761
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,800
argue a socially mixed neighborhood has

762
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,160
been developed here almost from scratch

763
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,099
there's all these white blocks that you

764
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,859
see here are new and only the brown ones

765
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,020
existed but that was possible because

766
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,380
the lens was publicly owned and could be

767
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,480
sold to developers under the condition

768
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,240
that they reserved this kind of uh

769
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,339
units for certain categories of people

770
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,000
and then we could look who is able to

771
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,060
rent or buy these units well in the belt

772
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,040
in case you need to fall below a certain

773
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,520
income at thresholds in order to be able

774
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,960
to eligible to be eligible for a social

775
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,980
housing

776
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,380
yeah the same goes for this

777
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,140
affordability

778
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,480
um criteria

779
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,980
um I don't know what how what was the

780
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,099
price exactly but I see here that um you

781
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:14,839
could earn up to 58 000 Euro of family

782
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,119
uh almost 4 000 Euro added for each

783
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,700
additional person so these are quite

784
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,660
uh quite High I think already but the

785
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,700
bottom line is that these developers

786
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,320
could not just build whatever they

787
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,000
wanted

788
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,680
that they needed to meet certain

789
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,660
criteria and that they also needed to

790
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,420
reserve quite a bit of number of units

791
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,640
for people

792
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,700
belong to different income computers

793
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,820
at the lowest income categories social

794
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,420
housing

795
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,020
so associately mixed neighborhoods when

796
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,480
it comes to Green goals yeah when it

797
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,940
comes to poverty and wealth could be

798
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,520
created but that was only possible

799
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,220
because there was a serious intervention

800
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,859
of the city council

801
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:09,359
in in this in Belgium

802
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,060
the the government or public authorities

803
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,940
are not really able to intervene that

804
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,780
much in terms because it's only laser

805
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,000
flop there's six percent of the units

806
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,780
which are social housing in Brussels are

807
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,200
10 and all the rest

808
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,480
um with a couple of exceptions minor

809
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,760
exceptions all the risk is the market

810
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,780
it's either people's own house or people

811
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,500
who rent a house from another office

812
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,599
but there are cities across the world

813
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:45,960
where you have 50 social housing okay

814
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,140
enough for example or Amsterdam is

815
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,040
another city a high percentage

816
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,320
it also means that as a council you can

817
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,260
intervene quite a bit the rule is where

818
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,839
in the Belgian case where

819
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,720
about 90 of the people need to find a

820
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,260
house or accommodation on the market you

821
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,960
will see that attempts to create a

822
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,420
social mix quickly lead to displacement

823
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,940
and quickly lead to concentrations of

824
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,820
poverty elsewhere in uh

825
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,320
particular house mix looks like and how

826
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,980
much facility councils can intervene in

827
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,619
in the house

828
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,619
um

829
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,520
there has been a time when the social

830
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,220
Housing Association sold kind of quite

831
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,420
some units

832
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,700
in any case there's a little bit of

833
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,000
Courage

834
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,540
and this type of models are attractive

835
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,760
for the developers right this question

836
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,820
about like I would think developers are

837
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,160
thinking about profits yeah as long as

838
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,960
they as long as they can still make

839
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,540
profits this is possible

840
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,000
and the same goes for this inclusionary

841
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,060
housing as long as a developer is able

842
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,839
to

843
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,060
make profits then this is awesome

844
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,460
in this case I don't think that the

845
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,380
developer said to pay a lot of money for

846
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,200
the city to get this piece of

847
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,180
them and because they were also asked to

848
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,760
because they had to develop the parts

849
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,619
and the streets

850
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,320
and they had to take there to develop

851
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
this social housing

852
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,119
so the city could have earned much more

853
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,579
money by selling this piece of land for

854
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,440
the highest price to a developer who

855
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,660
wanted to build a Sparkles for the

856
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,300
wealthiest of people that shows to do

857
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,380
things different

858
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,119
and there are many parts of the world

859
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,000
where we have these kind of schemes

860
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,480
hello

861
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,660
um

862
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,160
okay is social mix feasible the answer

863
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,660
is yes

864
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,240
it is feasible it is possible to create

865
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,599
socially mixed neighborhoods but it is

866
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,640
very hard to do that in a situation

867
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,579
where the market rings

868
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,020
because then

869
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,359
trying to attract middle class families

870
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,320
to a poor neighborhood will lead to

871
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,820
displacement of poor families to other

872
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,280
parts of the urban region in this case

873
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,520
that will not happen because you reserve

874
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,320
25 of the neighborhood to people who

875
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,320
fall below the certificate

876
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
and as long as these units are social

877
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,000
housing is 25 will remain there for this

878
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,260
population

879
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,119
and so you

880
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,940
allow

881
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,619
for people to live

882
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,540
in a neighborhood

883
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,099
where

884
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,320
50

885
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,660
belongs to middle class for the upper

886
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,560
middle class at 25 percent

887
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,420
um hope these units goes to very rich

888
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,160
people who can afford to spend one

889
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,820
million euros

890
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,540
another question

891
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,720
and like this could be like

892
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,820
social takes early in this one

893
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,960
particularly

894
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,980
radius area in the city but then

895
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,000
wouldn't this be like our classic

896
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,700
example actually should wear like um

897
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,500
capital is being

898
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,839
for illness because even I mean just

899
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,540
from experiences your housing I don't

900
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,140
know

901
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,619
example usually these are like very

902
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:17,280
up-to-date luxury buildings and um there

903
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,300
are so affordable and social housing

904
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,859
however this then changes

905
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,520
so it might there might be different

906
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,800
but then the general effect would

907
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,700
actually

908
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,140
benefit

909
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,140
development

910
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:44,040
found it not like actually the people

911
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,440
who are living there beforehand and

912
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,980
maybe have to preserve it

913
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,040
um

914
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,940
but I think in this case you talk about

915
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,680
people who lived there we're just

916
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,140
understand already that was not so much

917
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,760
the case here because you only had a

918
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,680
couple of hundreds people you developed

919
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,680
a neighborhood for thousands of people

920
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,839
um it was a neighborhood that was uh

921
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,940
more to related I was not so much

922
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,280
put in this

923
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,520
wouldn't this just be another example of

924
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,520
gentrification

925
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,680
and not really attempting to solve

926
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,520
or trying to

927
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,460
purchases

928
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,900
but like is it it depends how you how

929
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,400
you define it

930
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,920
also you would say gentrification comes

931
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,560
with displacement and displacement would

932
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,800
be an essential part of gentrification

933
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
in this case

934
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,660
there might be a displacement of the

935
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,500
people who lived in these brown houses

936
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,900
and will live there already

937
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,460
before the rest of the neighborhood

938
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,680
before the white parts of the main route

939
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,099
were being constructed

940
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:14,160
but there will not be a displacement in

941
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,240
this 25 units which are either rented

942
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,900
out or sold as social house because you

943
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,339
will need to fall below a certain

944
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:26,700
incompatible in order to buy or rent

945
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,339
these places and no matter what happens

946
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,560
in the rest of the neighborhood as

947
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,119
humans will still remain

948
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,460
reserved for people probably not

949
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,579
income threshold so this is a way to

950
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,160
make sure that this place

951
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,740
even if you buy this kind of

952
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,680
so you will not be able to sell them

953
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,200
and if you rent them out

954
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,000
then this is also under the condition

955
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,500
that fall below the circle

956
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,300
everything else

957
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,040
as this whole area has been gentrified

958
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,839
there has been urban renewal in this

959
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:15,300
whole area so it's only in this very

960
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,579
small part where you they were able to

961
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:21,079
create the social studies

962
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,319
yeah yeah one important thing is the

963
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,300
scale the scale at which we discuss

964
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,940
things that we are talking about a very

965
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,339
small scale the neighborhood of a couple

966
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:34,800
of thousand people but indeed if you

967
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,260
discuss it at a scale of Antwerp then

968
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,200
you would see that this whole area

969
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,079
around this red square that we've just

970
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,420
been talking about has been going

971
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,740
through an improvement of this

972
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,119
disadvantaged index and has been going

973
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,960
through a very very

974
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,599
strong gentrification sorry that's

975
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,280
you're completely just a very fair

976
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,420
cooler I'm sorry but then I'm just

977
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,940
curious how it works here like

978
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,260
um

979
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,520
developers can get

980
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,740
tactics or like benefits from the garden

981
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,420
for providing sir

982
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,920
called public housing because that's how

983
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,060
it works

984
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,579
well I don't know about these these tax

985
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:20,520
rebates but for sure the lens price for

986
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,220
which they were able to acquire this

987
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,380
well the price for which they were able

988
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,339
to

989
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:29,760
buy this piece of land from city council

990
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,720
was much lower than it would have been

991
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,920
just a market with a gate

992
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,319
okay is it is it

993
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,060
yeah yeah more questions

994
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,599
but um I know

995
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:08,220
okay now we move to the next question is

996
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,060
it then good or bad is it desirable to

997
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,760
create such a neighbor now what you say

998
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,339
is that well the kind of shops that you

999
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:18,780
find

1000
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,859
the most dictators for the meats and the

1001
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:26,760
desires of this 75 percent of residents

1002
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,760
and a lot of tourists and visitors who

1003
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,640
like to visit that part of the city

1004
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,740
and so that could be a reason to say

1005
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,140
well it's not desirable to do this

1006
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,839
because these people will not find cheap

1007
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,020
food in the area or the kind of

1008
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,119
a product statement like they would like

1009
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,300
to buy but that shows that we are moving

1010
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,940
to uh the next question

1011
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,440
is social mix uh

1012
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,119
and I guess it would be time for a break

1013
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,119
I'm running a bit behind schedule

1014
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,260
I'm wondering there is a three-hour

1015
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,319
and three hours are dedicated to

1016
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:10,020
urban geography last week I've been

1017
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,380
limiting my last two hours would it be a

1018
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,180
big problem if I would go if it's over

1019
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,280
these two hours of course

1020
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,280
okay I'll I'll just go through the

1021
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,720
slides and

1022
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,720
we'll see we'll see uh what time what

1023
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,640
time but I think it's better to have a

1024
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,980
break now before moving to this next

1025
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,440
question is it desirable create this uh

1026
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,640
five minutes and then we continue

1027
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:55,629
[Music]

1028
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,670
thank you

1029
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,729
[Music]

1030
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,640
very random questions

1031
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,180
thank you

1032
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,520
yes

1033
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,640
thank you

1034
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,920
uh

1035
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,920
questions

1036
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,180
anyways

1037
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,400
there is

1038
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,400
Paris

1039
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,559
thank you

1040
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,960
thank you

1041
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:34,099
thank you

1042
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
um

1043
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,439
[Music]

1044
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,440
thank you

1045
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:44,099
questions

1046
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,900
thank you

1047
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,920
thank you

1048
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,619
is it

1049
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,420
maybe I should have known this earlier

1050
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,300
so let's continue with this uh in the

1051
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,760
next question my social mixed desire

1052
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,000
I think I might need to skip question

1053
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,280
number four

1054
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,819
um or part number four and in any case I

1055
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:10,859
believe it's time to uh

1056
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:14,720
to go into the arguments here

1057
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:15,720
um

1058
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,160
sure the overarching Assumption amongst

1059
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,599
policy makers

1060
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,559
and also the dominant hypothesis amongst

1061
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,660
researchers

1062
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,680
seems to be that where you live

1063
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,780
affects your life chances

1064
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,920
yeah whether you live in Antwerp

1065
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,920
in this line blocking

1066
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,940
this social housing estate believe

1067
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,900
or whether you live as a poor person in

1068
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,599
alternate North where you have all these

1069
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,640
shops

1070
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,240
and ethnic bars and you have

1071
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,000
employment close by Etc

1072
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,400
that makes a difference

1073
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,220
yeah so the basic question

1074
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,819
of researchers has been can impoverished

1075
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:11,339
neighborhoods neighborhoods with a

1076
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:14,400
concentration of poverty can they make

1077
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,200
their residents worse

1078
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,720
because

1079
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,900
maybe two observations before our look

1080
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,599
into the different arguments the

1081
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:28,819
different

1082
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:31,260
ways in which this question has been

1083
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,359
answered

1084
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:34,859
observation number one is that

1085
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,240
researchers

1086
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,000
working in different sub-disciplines

1087
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,119
I've been showing you this diagram last

1088
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:43,680
week already

1089
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,599
research is working in different

1090
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,480
sub-disciplines of human geography or

1091
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,599
Urban studies more broadly have been

1092
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,359
answering this question differently

1093
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:56,760
and where would you position translator

1094
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,559
on the map

1095
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,339
what kind of Joker is he

1096
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:04,440
do you have an ID

1097
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,200
Marxist geographer writing about the

1098
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,660
capitalistic moment of production

1099
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,900
and he's a Marxist geographer

1100
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,559
and he's mainly interested in

1101
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,319
socio-economic

1102
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:20,940
issues

1103
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,900
yeah

1104
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,180
what happens to poor people when they

1105
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,920
live in a poor neighborhood

1106
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,020
other geographers have been asking

1107
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,119
different researchers for example

1108
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,500
relating to ethnicultural

1109
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,319
segregation as of all article wide by

1110
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:40,020
for example deals with

1111
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,420
ethnic segregation

1112
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,020
and not with social economic signage

1113
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,960
a Marxist geographer such as Tom Slater

1114
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,680
will be interested in

1115
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,480
socio-economic segregation where the

1116
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,819
poor and rich people live and is that

1117
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:58,020
meaningful

1118
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,059
in the eradication of poverty for

1119
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:00,900
example

1120
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,059
so you see the different geographers

1121
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:06,059
have been asking different research

1122
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:09,119
questions when it comes to these effects

1123
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,800
of segregation

1124
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,480
they have also been using different

1125
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,940
research methodologies

1126
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,319
we use large service they have a survey

1127
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:23,339
of 1 000 people in order to answer these

1128
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:25,319
questions or do you have qualitative

1129
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:27,240
research where you interviewed 30

1130
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,160
families

1131
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,220
number 13 30 people living in a

1132
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,339
neighborhood or displaced from looking

1133
00:58:34,339 --> 00:58:37,680
so different research methodologies and

1134
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,000
then you've also been reading

1135
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,000
that there might also be different

1136
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,040
ideological underpinnings

1137
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,680
uh underlying the work of these

1138
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,200
different so I think it is important for

1139
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,780
you to understand that just like I

1140
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,359
argued last week for the causes of

1141
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,000
segregation and the different arguments

1142
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,500
that have been

1143
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,319
even for why people live

1144
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,020
in segregated neighborhoods but also

1145
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,540
when it comes to these effects of

1146
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,640
segregation and the broad literature

1147
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,280
around it the people working in

1148
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,920
different positions and different

1149
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,540
sub-disciplines of human geography

1150
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,359
geography have been giving different

1151
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:26,220
answers to these questions

1152
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,260
another remark

1153
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,380
that I want to give before going to the

1154
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,260
answers to that question is that it is

1155
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,000
important

1156
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,960
to see that studies on neighborhood

1157
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,520
affects their birth marks what do I mean

1158
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,420
with it is that it matters rare a study

1159
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,059
takes place and often for example

1160
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:55,520
literature of the effects of segregation

1161
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,099
studies conducted in the United States

1162
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:01,079
that the conclusions of these studies

1163
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:03,660
have been used for example to influence

1164
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,599
policy in Western Europe

1165
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,579
and while it is

1166
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:11,520
quite important to see the differences

1167
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,920
between these different contexts last

1168
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,480
week I have been highlighting for

1169
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,359
example that and when it comes to

1170
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:21,480
desegregation in dishes and it turns out

1171
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,540
that segregation in the United States is

1172
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,480
much stronger more prevalent than it is

1173
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,920
in Europe

1174
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,900
yeah so that's an important difference

1175
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,480
when you take the conclusions from one

1176
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,040
country to the other

1177
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,880
the welfare states in Western Europe has

1178
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,339
been much more developed than in the

1179
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:43,140
United States so when it comes to

1180
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,540
poverty and the eradication of poverty

1181
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,420
this is a completely different issue in

1182
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,520
a western European context than a disc

1183
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,700
major Latin America

1184
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,280
so it's important

1185
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,119
that you contextualize studies on

1186
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,579
segregation in the United States for

1187
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,700
example and then you just do not

1188
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,119
transfer these conclusions to

1189
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:10,799
to Europe

1190
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,799
many of the

1191
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,180
um

1192
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,180
studies on neighborhood effects and the

1193
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,460
effects of segregation have been

1194
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,220
conducted in the Netherlands and also

1195
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,980
this Dutch context is a very peculiar

1196
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,119
way

1197
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,319
and where for example concerns about the

1198
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:33,420
bailiff that's what you see there a

1199
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,780
particular neighborhood in Amsterdam

1200
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,299
have been quite important in stimulating

1201
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:41,960
This research field

1202
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,980
I'm doing for time

1203
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,160
but this far right politicians in the

1204
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,960
Netherlands have always been brother but

1205
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,420
for two decades already have been a very

1206
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,599
vulgar yeah and that's also important to

1207
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,299
understand why and this research field

1208
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,880
has been sort of developed in the

1209
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,000
Netherlands so important to

1210
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,980
provincialize distance and to understand

1211
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:11,700
that a study in Vienna or in Antwerp or

1212
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,940
in Brussels or in the United States that

1213
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,339
it's important to contextualize and to

1214
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:19,380
understand the specificities of this

1215
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,640
particular context

1216
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:27,180
I have seven answers to this question I

1217
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,119
remember the question can impoverished

1218
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:32,579
neighborhoods make their residence worse

1219
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:35,280
off or when I'm interested in ethnic

1220
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,339
cultural segregation and neighborhoods

1221
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:41,880
with the concentration of uh people for

1222
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,319
origin make integration more difficult

1223
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,720
yeah

1224
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,160
um

1225
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,819
seven different arguments the first one

1226
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:57,240
The Social Network archives I think many

1227
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,460
of you might have heard of the work of

1228
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,900
Robert Putnam

1229
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,720
focusing on social capital or the social

1230
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,760
capital the connections among

1231
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,400
individuals the social networks the

1232
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,839
Norms of reciprocity reciprocity and

1233
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,579
trustworthiness that arise from

1234
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:17,520
making a distinction between owning

1235
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,400
Capital what is bombing Capital these

1236
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,339
are social networks connections Norms of

1237
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:26,760
reciprocity between socially homogeneous

1238
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,819
people for example people of the same

1239
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:32,400
ethnicity are people of the same social

1240
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,520
and economic group

1241
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,720
distinction between bonding and

1242
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,180
breaching and approaching Capital being

1243
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,299
actions networks launch of reciprocity

1244
01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:45,000
and trustworthiness during socially

1245
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,740
heterogeneous

1246
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,540
for example people of different

1247
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,859
ethnicities

1248
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:53,700
are people of different social economics

1249
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,940
and the argument is often that reaching

1250
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:00,540
capital is important for social Mobility

1251
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,960
yeah for example if you're poor

1252
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,099
from your middle class neighbor you will

1253
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:10,440
get to hear about jobs

1254
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,200
and it is a person who's working I mean

1255
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,059
there is a job opportunity in the office

1256
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,099
where this person learns he might share

1257
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:19,799
this knowledge that she might share it

1258
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:22,440
with is for her name

1259
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,099
to work and when you do not speak Dutch

1260
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:28,319
it might be good to have this white

1261
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:31,079
middle class family this Empire City

1262
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,540
Council was so interested in living next

1263
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,960
to you because you maybe they can help

1264
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,380
yourself or daughter with homework

1265
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,660
um as they Stitch and so these are the

1266
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:46,799
IDS behind this argument saying that

1267
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,480
well it's good

1268
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,880
to have mixed neighborhoods because

1269
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,200
these mixed neighborhoods will lead to

1270
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,660
heterogeneous networks they will lead to

1271
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,280
breaching capital and that will be

1272
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,619
important that will be to the benefits

1273
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:04,200
of poor people living in such a

1274
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,280
neighborhood

1275
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,339
and so one reason why you would want to

1276
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:11,280
create a socialist neighborhood is

1277
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,920
because you want to create heterogeneous

1278
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,559
social networks because you assume that

1279
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,280
bridging Capital will help poor people

1280
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,760
to be socially mobile and to join them

1281
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,420
to for example through education or true

1282
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,740
choice

1283
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,660
and so this is one of the seven

1284
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,099
arguments

1285
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:37,940
that underpins this ideal of social mix

1286
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:41,220
but when we study how people live

1287
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,339
it turns out that

1288
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:47,819
people are rather Mobile in a city do

1289
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,799
not limit their lives to a particular

1290
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:50,940
neighborhood

1291
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:53,280
and that many of the social networks

1292
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,260
that develop in a neighborhood spend

1293
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:58,260
different neighborhood borders and this

1294
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,200
is a study from

1295
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,900
in China looking at the social networks

1296
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,599
of people living in four different types

1297
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,299
of neighborhoods and in each of these

1298
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,880
neighborhoods the conclusion is that

1299
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,579
most people get to know people through

1300
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:16,380
work

1301
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:23,520
yeah and spent time with colleagues also

1302
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,180
um after after working hours

1303
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:29,160
and many people also get to know people

1304
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,079
through kinship

1305
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:34,079
from a childhood through the schools of

1306
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:36,559
their children

1307
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,720
and they are actually quite a small

1308
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,160
amount of social networks in each of

1309
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,720
these neighborhoods less than that

1310
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,340
percent

1311
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:47,760
[Music]

1312
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,900
um

1313
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,000
what um when you look at the social

1314
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,920
connections of these people there is a

1315
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,380
quite a small amount that helps in these

1316
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,720
neighborhoods and no matter in which of

1317
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,460
the four types of neighborhoods they

1318
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,780
look

1319
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,660
people seem to develop mostly

1320
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,720
bones

1321
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,960
connections networks with people from

1322
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,760
outside the snake

1323
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,700
and so this idea that by bringing the

1324
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,859
middle class for example to the middle

1325
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:19,140
class to a cool neighborhood that this

1326
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,660
would be a way to create these social

1327
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,599
networks and when you look at this then

1328
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:27,059
these social networks also develop

1329
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:29,280
outside the neighborhood so why to focus

1330
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,200
so much on that neighborhood where

1331
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,180
people live

1332
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:37,400
very culturally kind of like

1333
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,619
culture e

1334
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:42,619
ffort

1335
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,740
in other countries you mean yeah the

1336
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:49,760
situation would be different

1337
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,059
donations

1338
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:56,339
well I told you it's important to

1339
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:58,440
understand the context of this of this

1340
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,339
study

1341
01:07:59,339 --> 01:08:01,859
but in any case also for for Western

1342
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:03,900
European cities if you if you would

1343
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,599
study this process over time I think you

1344
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:10,440
would find out that connections are less

1345
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,780
neighborhood based than they used to I

1346
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,579
can imagine that this neighborhood will

1347
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:16,080
still be important

1348
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,640
and people still get to know a lot of

1349
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,479
um

1350
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:24,238
other families for example through their

1351
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,640
children through the school in many

1352
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,140
countries of the world we have a school

1353
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,479
pitching system where living in a

1354
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,339
neighborhood me sending your kids to the

1355
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:34,500
same school and so for sure there are

1356
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,799
many reasons why this would be different

1357
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:41,100
in other countries but overall I think

1358
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,238
this argument

1359
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,880
truth that there are also many social

1360
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,460
networks that the total outsides the

1361
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,380
neighborhood of course there are also

1362
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,299
studies that focus on burning produce

1363
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:52,679
and say well these people are less

1364
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:54,960
mobile than rich people and so it's

1365
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,698
exactly for these poor people that this

1366
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,500
neighborhood is an important

1367
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,620
uh

1368
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:04,259
ground of network population

1369
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:07,259
much more than it is for rich people

1370
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:09,899
and if you do not have a job if you do

1371
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:11,640
not have the money to buy a bus ticket

1372
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,738
now that's neighborhood context will be

1373
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:16,979
an important one for social networks to

1374
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:19,198
be develop that's also for different

1375
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,939
categories of people this might be

1376
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:22,460
different

1377
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,080
but still I think it's important to see

1378
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,238
that networks do not only develop inside

1379
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:29,339
a neighborhood that there are also

1380
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:33,600
networks in other parts of other parts

1381
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,979
of the city

1382
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,020
or with people living in other parts of

1383
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,140
this

1384
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,160
um

1385
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,719
drawing

1386
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:47,399
white double income families

1387
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:52,140
to a neighborhood such as model make and

1388
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,660
if it's possible will that then make

1389
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:58,860
these networks diverse a study by Sabina

1390
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,460
Rick and Mike

1391
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:05,880
in a German cities I think it was Marx

1392
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,060
law in the old area

1393
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:11,880
and they have been interviewing uh the

1394
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,780
white

1395
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,960
uh middle class people in this example

1396
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,340
two women

1397
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,739
about their social meds and there is

1398
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:21,659
quite a lot on this diagram I might need

1399
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:24,600
to explain it so you see the women in

1400
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,460
the middle and then you have different

1401
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,260
scales

1402
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,840
you know the neighborhoods you have the

1403
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,239
city you have Germany and you have

1404
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:36,540
outside of Germany and so people

1405
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,300
who are the important people in your

1406
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:43,679
life ask that and we put them on this

1407
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:45,239
diagram saying well there are people

1408
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:47,400
inside the neighborhoods people living

1409
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,080
in the same city but you also know

1410
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,000
people in the same country and people

1411
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,340
also living roles and for different

1412
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,199
people you would get to different

1413
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:59,280
diagrams and what they also did is to

1414
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,380
map a contact frequency

1415
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,020
so if you have frequent contacts this

1416
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,860
error will be more bold than it is for

1417
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,800
people so you can have a rare complex

1418
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,820
and then they also met the level of

1419
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:20,820
Education an indicator for a class

1420
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,679
room saying well are these people that

1421
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:27,060
you frequent are they people of with the

1422
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,760
same educational background

1423
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,580
middle class people high education

1424
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,460
Highly Educated or are these people who

1425
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,360
do not have Universal qualifications

1426
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,580
now the other thing that you see here is

1427
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,800
the type of relation between frequent

1428
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,600
these people or do they provide you with

1429
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,980
emotional support or instrumentals

1430
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:52,739
materials or a good talk for example on

1431
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:55,260
the issues so it's quite a complex not

1432
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,620
but what you see is that first of all

1433
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:02,040
just like in the Chinese example many

1434
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,699
people have social networks that are

1435
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:07,380
part of a social network with people

1436
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,900
living outside the neighborhoods and

1437
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,179
what you also see there is that most of

1438
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:14,400
the connections that these middle class

1439
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,679
women in these underprivileged

1440
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:19,800
neighborhoods develop are with other

1441
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,500
people with the same educational

1442
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:25,140
qualification so the idea that's

1443
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,659
bringing middle class people to another

1444
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:30,199
privileged neighborhood will create

1445
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:33,120
heterogeneous social networks in which

1446
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,980
you find poor and rich people people

1447
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,739
does not seem to hold true here because

1448
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:39,960
the middle class people that you attract

1449
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,480
to these neighborhoods create mostly

1450
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,820
social bonds with people like them with

1451
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,760
other middle thoughts

1452
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,159
the episode is bridging capital

1453
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,260
that was the reason why you wanted to

1454
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,719
make this neighborhood there's not

1455
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:57,560
really developed

1456
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,380
another argument is that

1457
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,840
creating a mixed neighborhood

1458
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,920
might disrupt the strong ties that exist

1459
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,920
there already the only Capital that

1460
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,860
exists and the strong forms of social

1461
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:17,040
economic emotional support that people

1462
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,560
of the same ethnicity for example

1463
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,860
provide when they live in a neighborhood

1464
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,760
part of the city

1465
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,800
so residents living in this interested

1466
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,400
parts of cities Slater argued fall back

1467
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,380
on what they know and what they have

1468
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:38,820
each other is bonding capital is crucial

1469
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:42,360
in the lives of poor people in the lives

1470
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,400
of newcomers who have just arrived to

1471
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,380
the city they will look for core ethics

1472
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,760
first

1473
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,520
and if you create a mix if you want to

1474
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,320
create a mixed neighborhood in these

1475
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,960
parts of cloud for example by attracting

1476
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,360
another class they will displace some

1477
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,219
people and that will disrupt this

1478
01:13:59,219 --> 01:14:01,620
bonding Capital Network system

1479
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,260
yeah so

1480
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:06,840
what I'm trying to do

1481
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,420
is to say well there is an argument

1482
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,580
there why you would create a mixed

1483
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,280
neighborhood but you also have

1484
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,179
a couple of counter arguments as to why

1485
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:21,120
argument might not work or the whole

1486
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,340
reason underlying that argument might

1487
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,600
not work

1488
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,699
social networks

1489
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:29,280
yeah Social Capital owning and bridging

1490
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,300
capital

1491
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,260
I guess you you got the point there

1492
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:37,980
a second argument is called underclass

1493
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,020
Art

1494
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,820
and this is an argument that has

1495
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,100
developed in the United States in the

1496
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,320
1980s

1497
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,540
and at that time there was a big

1498
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,980
discussion

1499
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,560
between structuralists

1500
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,560
who look at the causes of poverty in the

1501
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,600
declining economic base

1502
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,300
and for example Marxist geographers

1503
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,159
saying well there is a shift from a

1504
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,699
fullness to a post for this capitalism

1505
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:08,040
and this makes it harder for these

1506
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,080
people to quiet job

1507
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,360
or the arguments that you've heard in

1508
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,860
the classes by that Apostles about

1509
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,300
polarization

1510
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,020
is there a declining job markets

1511
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,239
so you're looking for structural causes

1512
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:24,000
of poverty and on the other hand you had

1513
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,840
cultures except poverty is dead because

1514
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,080
you have a culture of poverty

1515
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,260
poor people have certain attitudes have

1516
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,080
a certain behavior and this keeps them

1517
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,219
in poverty so that was an important

1518
01:15:40,219 --> 01:15:42,780
discussion between these two

1519
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,420
and this underclass argument

1520
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,880
is part of this cultural history of

1521
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,840
looking at poverty yeah who is this

1522
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,520
underclass

1523
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,400
they're not talking about all poor

1524
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,199
people in the case of the United States

1525
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:01,440
in the 1980s 33 million people were

1526
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,800
consistent who was this underclass that

1527
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,280
was a minority in this minority five

1528
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,100
million people yeah people who followed

1529
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,659
below the

1530
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:14,960
income threshold for which they are

1531
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,179
considered to be poor disproportionately

1532
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:22,080
Black and Hispanic minority in this poor

1533
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,300
minority but what defines them it's not

1534
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:27,120
so much the poverty or their base but

1535
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,739
their behavior

1536
01:16:28,739 --> 01:16:32,460
okay there's probably lawlessness drug

1537
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:35,400
use out of Redwood Birds lack of

1538
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,040
employment welfare dependency and school

1539
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,060
faith

1540
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:42,120
and also these culturalists blame the

1541
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,140
poor

1542
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,659
to be poor because of their own behavior

1543
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:46,860
and

1544
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:49,260
the way they look different

1545
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:52,500
and so this is this underclass argument

1546
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,880
so what is the argument exactly that in

1547
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,860
ketos or in neighborhoods where you find

1548
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:02,159
the concentration of poor people that

1549
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,800
you find more unemployment more welfare

1550
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,080
dependency more early School Leaving

1551
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,380
more truancy or criminality more

1552
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:13,620
gambling more direct abuse more alcohol

1553
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,159
abuse more out of Bedford Sports teenage

1554
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:20,040
pregnancy more dysfunctional values

1555
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,280
whatever that may aim due to

1556
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,260
okay

1557
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:27,179
socialization affects within these

1558
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:28,739
things

1559
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:30,960
if you grow up in a neighborhood like

1560
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,800
that

1561
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,620
and your peers

1562
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,840
the people of your age the people that

1563
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,179
you frequent

1564
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:43,040
will have a higher chance to be

1565
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,739
criminals or gamblers or drug users or

1566
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:48,960
alcohol abusers Etc

1567
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,239
and that is why in such neighborhood you

1568
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:54,060
find more of this

1569
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:57,360
we also find a lack of role models with

1570
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,120
a job without a drug addiction without

1571
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,920
an alcohol

1572
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,460
IC and who were not teenage mothers Etc

1573
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,320
so there's a lack of

1574
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,600
positive role models

1575
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,719
and you also have this peer group effect

1576
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:16,020
and so why are you worse of living as a

1577
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,199
poor person in a poor neighborhood the

1578
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,659
argument of this culture this was that

1579
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:25,260
is because you have these Norms you have

1580
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:27,239
a lack of these role models and you have

1581
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:30,000
these peer group effects which made it

1582
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,159
well that's why it's your worst of

1583
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,460
living

1584
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,480
they also refer to physical

1585
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,760
infrastructure institutional networks

1586
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,620
the argument was

1587
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,780
that but this has been quite an

1588
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,120
important argument many policy makers

1589
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,699
have been facing

1590
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:50,699
or helping arguing for socialists

1591
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:53,100
because of this

1592
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,580
because they were convinced that living

1593
01:18:56,580 --> 01:19:00,659
in a poor neighborhood increased the

1594
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:03,300
chances that you found a job less

1595
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,420
important than you leave school early

1596
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:09,659
and because of of your friends doing the

1597
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:11,280
saying that you don't go to school

1598
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,380
because your friends would do so as well

1599
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,179
that you would turn into a criminal

1600
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:17,640
because this is the example that you

1601
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,420
have seen mostly

1602
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:26,100
okay now even when there would be a link

1603
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,679
between what is on the left and these

1604
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:30,540
poor neighborhoods then it can still be

1605
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:33,000
wonders whether what is the causal

1606
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,199
relationship

1607
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:36,060
between these two

1608
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,940
here on the map you have Chicago again a

1609
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,040
city that we are getting quite familiar

1610
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,100
with you see the poverty level

1611
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,920
in these neighborhoods that the darker

1612
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,739
the red the poorer the neighborhoods are

1613
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:51,780
and you see

1614
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:55,560
people arrested

1615
01:19:56,060 --> 01:20:00,540
for a drug use or

1616
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,780
something like this the possession of of

1617
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,040
Turks

1618
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,340
and what you see there is that uh

1619
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,520
there is a correlation

1620
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,020
between

1621
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:16,020
poverty and the concentration of poverty

1622
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:19,080
this neighborhood and the use of quality

1623
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,320
correct and coping is much scattered

1624
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,800
much more scattered and but you also see

1625
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,340
that in the other neighborhoods where

1626
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:32,280
you have a concentration of poverty that

1627
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,580
is much less the case

1628
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,460
now I can also wonder to what extent

1629
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,380
this graph

1630
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:46,560
is the result of real drug use or the

1631
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,540
policing of these Neighbors

1632
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,640
if you have a police force that is much

1633
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,540
more

1634
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:54,360
on the outlook for drug use in certain

1635
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,980
neighborhoods well that it's logical

1636
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,020
that this will show up in English

1637
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,280
statistics

1638
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,040
so there are many reasons why one could

1639
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,739
raise concerns about the causal

1640
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:07,140
relationship in this case between drug

1641
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,300
use on the one hand and the

1642
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,820
concentration of poverty on public so it

1643
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:14,820
could start to criticize like how these

1644
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,860
statistics came about one can also see

1645
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:19,500
that for certain drugs there seems to be

1646
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,739
a correlation for other circles one can

1647
01:21:22,739 --> 01:21:24,420
also see that you have concentrated

1648
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:28,260
poverty that corresponds with a lot of

1649
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,420
arrests for drug use but that you also

1650
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,980
have neighborhoods with concentration

1651
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,980
concentrated poverty organ specialists

1652
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,860
so there are many reasons why we would

1653
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,540
start to question whether there is a

1654
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,120
real cause of relation relationship

1655
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,940
concentration of poverty on the one hand

1656
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:47,699
and all these other indicators here on

1657
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:51,120
the slide on the other hand

1658
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,840
and another another argument against

1659
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,739
this underclass argument would be well

1660
01:21:57,739 --> 01:22:00,960
again socialization

1661
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,380
be disappears to not only live in these

1662
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,219
neighborhoods

1663
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:08,219
these Role Models do not only live in

1664
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:10,560
the neighborhood and Barack Obama could

1665
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,179
also be around

1666
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:14,699
yeah engine can can get these Role

1667
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:17,699
Models through TV or the the music that

1668
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:21,719
you're missing so why this focus on the

1669
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:23,699
neighborhood again

1670
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:26,520
third argument for social cohesion

1671
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,199
arguments

1672
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:30,719
and here you see

1673
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,960
um the basic line of thought

1674
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,620
of this of this argument where the

1675
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,140
ethnic minorities live isolated from

1676
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:43,260
native touch they have less contact with

1677
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,960
Native touch consequently they do not

1678
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:49,080
acquire an adequate command of the Dutch

1679
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,780
language are not likely to adopt such

1680
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:55,020
Norms values and will not succeed in

1681
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,420
socioeconomic terms

1682
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,780
so here you see a mixing of arguments

1683
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:03,540
about ethnic segregation

1684
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:06,179
and socio-economic Mobility

1685
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:08,820
saying that well if you live

1686
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:10,440
in a neighborhood with a high

1687
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:13,260
concentration of people of foreign

1688
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,460
background

1689
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,980
who speak their mother tongue and who

1690
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:20,219
are less good in speaking Dutch

1691
01:23:20,219 --> 01:23:24,000
and if you have less contact with

1692
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,940
native Dutch people then you will not

1693
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:30,900
acquire an adequate comment language you

1694
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,540
are not likely to evoke Dutch morals and

1695
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,620
values and therefore

1696
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:40,800
succeeds another argument that has been

1697
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,440
quite an important

1698
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,260
in the kind of rhetorics and the kind of

1699
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:49,380
discourse of policy makers advocating a

1700
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:50,520
social mix

1701
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,580
saying for example it's not good that in

1702
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:54,840
modern Bank you have a high

1703
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:58,219
concentration of foreign

1704
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:01,380
why is that not good well these people

1705
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:04,380
will not get to speak Dutch and they

1706
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:08,460
will not integrate to use that word they

1707
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:11,640
will not adults touch notes and values

1708
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:14,340
and that will make it harder for them to

1709
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:17,640
climb to social media

1710
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,540
again one can Wonder yeah is it only in

1711
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:24,060
the neighborhood that people could get a

1712
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,300
chance to develop this kind of

1713
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,300
relationships with Native touch even

1714
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:33,420
arguments true you could look at what is

1715
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,520
researchers do I will not go into the

1716
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,620
into all the details that they say about

1717
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:40,460
as own that's a place where people

1718
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:43,260
develop social networks you've got

1719
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,940
leisure activities through which people

1720
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,860
can develop

1721
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:49,199
you've got work and you've got the

1722
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,719
transport between these three different

1723
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:54,120
so it's important to look at all these

1724
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,340
domains and to see what happens between

1725
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,540
people

1726
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,280
and then you might see that this

1727
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,020
neighborhood in which these people live

1728
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:03,600
is less important

1729
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,120
another counter argument with focus on

1730
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,820
the importance of local culture it's

1731
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:11,280
only because you have a concentration of

1732
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,920
people of a certain ethnic background

1733
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,340
for example that you can support

1734
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:19,760
the shop that sells

1735
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,380
ethnic products that sell the food that

1736
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,780
sells the food from the home group where

1737
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:27,600
it allows you to have a church or an

1738
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,199
association by focusing on a particular

1739
01:25:30,199 --> 01:25:33,060
ethnic group and these kind of places

1740
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:36,420
might be very important they will act as

1741
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,460
a protective space they will act as a

1742
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,739
safe space in which these people feel

1743
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:43,020
like they've gone and this feeling of

1744
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,179
belonging might be very important for

1745
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:50,400
them to and to find a life in this new

1746
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,159
country where they are living

1747
01:25:53,159 --> 01:25:57,500
the social cohesion argument

1748
01:25:57,540 --> 01:26:00,719
a fourth argument will focus on local

1749
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,100
services

1750
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:06,480
yeah and it will say that for example in

1751
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,080
in

1752
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:12,540
neighborhoods with the concentration of

1753
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,120
poverty that you will have less public

1754
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,400
and private Services there will be less

1755
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,360
shops there will be less Banks and you

1756
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,820
might also have less Public Service

1757
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:27,480
these are examples from lootball social

1758
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,100
housing estate that I've been talking

1759
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:33,179
about today already and the closure of a

1760
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:36,300
bank and there is no ATM anymore in our

1761
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,440
paper

1762
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,600
the argument could go well if there

1763
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,699
would be more middle class people then

1764
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:44,159
there would be higher interest from

1765
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:48,500
Banks to have an ATM

1766
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,820
or other other ships

1767
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:56,400
Chicago

1768
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,800
food deserts I don't know whether you've

1769
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,380
ever heard about this term but if you

1770
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,139
look at healthy foods

1771
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:08,580
grocery shops where can you find them if

1772
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:12,020
you see a map with these different

1773
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:16,100
racial groups I remember it is this

1774
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,060
self-identification in the case of

1775
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,040
America that is a survey for which

1776
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,380
racial group to itself identifiably

1777
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,860
identified you see neighborhoods

1778
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,800
predominantly white black Hispanic Asian

1779
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,320
diverse and you see that in many of

1780
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,300
these black neighborhoods which are also

1781
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,000
the tourist neighborhoods you find that

1782
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,060
it's very hard to find healthy food it's

1783
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,980
very hard to find fresh vegetables like

1784
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:43,679
fruit because the shops are so far

1785
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:46,679
yeah so the argument would be that it's

1786
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,480
better to create mixed neighborhoods

1787
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,880
because that will attract a diverse set

1788
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,560
of

1789
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,739
um shops and services to these

1790
01:27:55,739 --> 01:27:57,360
neighborhoods

1791
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,699
we've already been talking about this

1792
01:27:59,699 --> 01:28:02,340
that the question of course is what kind

1793
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,380
of shops and what kind of services do

1794
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,360
you get in the case of this Mentor

1795
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:09,000
eyelasher District one person said well

1796
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,260
but this people will not feel

1797
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,260
comfortable shops and they will also not

1798
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:15,239
find the products they would like to

1799
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:16,560
find

1800
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,760
that's also in gentrifying neighborhoods

1801
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,800
and what kind of

1802
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,780
shops do you find there

1803
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:27,300
is a shops catering for

1804
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,280
people who look for the cheapest food

1805
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,719
possible because they have only five

1806
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:36,480
euro to spend in in the last three days

1807
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,620
of the month

1808
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:42,060
or is it cafes or restaurants who try to

1809
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,000
cater for these

1810
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,739
incoming Gentry Fighters

1811
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:49,139
so it's important to look at the

1812
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:51,600
different shaded demands that will

1813
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,080
result from creating a mixed and so the

1814
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,880
question is if you've mixed name routes

1815
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,060
will these shops and services cater for

1816
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,239
these poor people

1817
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,980
because if that's not the case then it

1818
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:07,920
will displace the shops that existed

1819
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,320
there already ended catered For This

1820
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,760
audience

1821
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,860
in answer we've also been talking about

1822
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,260
a lot of these

1823
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:18,000
specialized services that you might get

1824
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,860
in neighborhoods

1825
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,739
and at least

1826
01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:26,100
money transfer short steps or Food Shops

1827
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:30,659
like some African vegetables or

1828
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:33,420
Thai ingredients

1829
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:35,639
and the question is if you try to mix

1830
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:37,920
these neighborhoods to these kind of

1831
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,900
shops and these kind of services still

1832
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:44,400
be able to to be to remain or will they

1833
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,920
also be displaced because this place

1834
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,460
will be involved by a fancy coffee shop

1835
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:54,840
that is mainly catered for these Gentry

1836
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:57,659
farmers so questions around shops

1837
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,940
Services catering for different

1838
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:02,940
audiences

1839
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:06,179
argument that you find in the literature

1840
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:08,400
is a political one

1841
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,179
starting from the observation that many

1842
01:30:11,179 --> 01:30:13,940
neighborhood associations for example

1843
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:19,739
are well mainly run by middle class

1844
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:21,900
and that middle class people are are

1845
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,540
much more focal in expressing their

1846
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:26,340
concerns about the people

1847
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,860
and so one could say that well by

1848
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:31,380
attracting the middle class to a poor

1849
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,480
neighborhood this neighborhood will be

1850
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,159
higher on the political agenda

1851
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:40,199
um and I I have this quote there from

1852
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:42,780
that I read at the end of the Excursion

1853
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:45,780
inshallah in my channel for people

1854
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,940
stating well there are also taxpayers

1855
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,340
why don't you listen to us

1856
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:53,100
yeah so the idea is that by mixing

1857
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,159
neighborhoods you will put these

1858
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:59,219
neighborhoods higher Jim

1859
01:30:59,219 --> 01:31:02,639
I'm in Belgium people from outside the

1860
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:05,940
EU without a built-in passport we are

1861
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:07,260
able to vote

1862
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,120
but this will not be the case in every

1863
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,100
country and so you can have a

1864
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,679
neighborhood with a lot of people from

1865
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,679
outside the room who do not have a say

1866
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:19,199
in vocal politics and why would this

1867
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:23,100
local mayor address the concerns of

1868
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,780
people living

1869
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:27,540
any of these people are not able to

1870
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:31,320
Express their needs and to put a stamp

1871
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,120
on the political agenda then why would

1872
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,639
you do so the argument is well middle

1873
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:37,679
class people are

1874
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,320
able they have these connections with

1875
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,719
politicians or at least they will be

1876
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,500
listened to

1877
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,960
um

1878
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,840
well in I'm not going to go into into

1879
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,120
that into that example

1880
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,159
um but it dealt with the Emperor of

1881
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:57,600
Highway

1882
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,360
and that issue of air pollution to the

1883
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,920
observation that most of the

1884
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,199
neighborhoods lying next to that Highway

1885
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:07,380
are rather so one good question what

1886
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,659
would happen with this whole issue of

1887
01:32:09,659 --> 01:32:12,780
the whole debate around the highway if

1888
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:15,480
these neighborhoods could not be your

1889
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,940
neighborhoods bogus income but rather

1890
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:21,980
than they were the highest activities

1891
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,800
so the political arguments

1892
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,199
by mixing neighborhoods we will put them

1893
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:30,239
higher on the political agent

1894
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,340
of course the issue isn't my report

1895
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:36,560
she's not listened to poor people

1896
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,820
political agenda without these middle

1897
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,520
class residents

1898
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,679
the sixth argument is a bit different

1899
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:49,679
the spatial mismatch does not focus so

1900
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,699
much on the issue of segregation but if

1901
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:57,179
you follow these five dimensions of

1902
01:32:57,179 --> 01:32:57,840
um

1903
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,179
Messi and London it focuses on

1904
01:33:00,179 --> 01:33:03,360
concentration clustering where do poor

1905
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,460
people live in which part of the city

1906
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,560
are these neighborhoods with the

1907
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:11,100
concentration of poverty and this is a

1908
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,980
diagram from Cape Town quite an old one

1909
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:16,380
but it's still very much the game the

1910
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,440
case where do you have job opportunities

1911
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,460
in light and where do you have

1912
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:25,440
population where do people live and

1913
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,739
where do they where where could they

1914
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:31,199
and most of the job opportunities are

1915
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:32,940
still in the previously white

1916
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,699
neighborhoods particularly in essential

1917
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:38,340
business district of Cape Town but most

1918
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:41,760
of the poor people in Cape Town are

1919
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,159
living quite far away from these places

1920
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:46,139
so there is a mismatch between the

1921
01:33:46,139 --> 01:33:49,080
places where it's good lift and the

1922
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,960
places where the good potential work and

1923
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,940
so it's not just important to focus on

1924
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:56,820
segregation and the fact that poverty is

1925
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:58,020
concentrated

1926
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,600
in these more peripheral neighborhoods

1927
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,980
in the case

1928
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:04,139
but you need to focus then also on the

1929
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:06,120
distance between various neighborhoods

1930
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:08,159
are and the places where these people

1931
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,620
could work so there's this the spatial

1932
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:13,199
mismatch argument focusing on the

1933
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:16,320
mismatch between place of residence and

1934
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:20,840
potential places of the world

1935
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:24,900
Western European cities tend to have a

1936
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,540
better public transport than North

1937
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:29,880
American for southern

1938
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:32,280
so one could argue this argument will

1939
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,679
hold less true in the case of Brussels

1940
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:37,560
for example because even if you live in

1941
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:40,080
Philadelphia there are good training

1942
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:44,179
connections to Apple short places

1943
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,679
um this is a map

1944
01:34:46,679 --> 01:34:49,260
for Brussels

1945
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:52,679
job density you see two clusters the

1946
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:53,880
inner city

1947
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:56,639
and all these offices and the area

1948
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:59,659
around the airport

1949
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,679
um where the poor people in Brussels

1950
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:05,219
live mostly in this 19th century belt

1951
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:09,060
around beginners meaning that there's

1952
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,400
not so much of a spatial mismatch if you

1953
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,040
live in Mozambique you can walk to many

1954
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,380
job opportunities of course the question

1955
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:19,500
like this where do you have both skilled

1956
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,719
job properties

1957
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:24,000
so if you don't need a lot of Education

1958
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,920
when you see that more or less the same

1959
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,960
clusters

1960
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,960
their scores as Jobs shift

1961
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,260
towards the airport the issue is what

1962
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,420
are the transport connections between

1963
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:39,620
Golden Bank St

1964
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:44,100
Josephs and these areas where you find

1965
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:48,120
the growth of most new or most new jobs

1966
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,100
and in the case of Brussels the issue

1967
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:51,300
will also be

1968
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:53,639
what are the language requirements for

1969
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:55,620
these jobs because these are jobs

1970
01:35:55,620 --> 01:36:00,360
flounders what kind of touch proficiency

1971
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:03,060
do you need and often for these jobs

1972
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:05,400
that will be touched and French maybe

1973
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:09,659
also English so just language wise these

1974
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:14,040
jobs are already quite difficult

1975
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,199
so the spatial mismatch argument

1976
01:36:16,199 --> 01:36:19,320
focusing on the location of these poor

1977
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,360
neighborhoods so it's not just

1978
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,400
how mixed these neighborhoods are

1979
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,380
whether poor and richness side by side

1980
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:27,840
but where do these concentrations of

1981
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,420
poverty occur

1982
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:33,300
last argument stigmatism

1983
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:36,360
and this is an argument that Slater has

1984
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,400
been writing about it is important to

1985
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,340
look what happens outside of these

1986
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,380
neighborhoods understood

1987
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:46,500
you know why is it harder to climb the

1988
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:49,080
social leather to embroider out for all

1989
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,480
of the equivalents because teachers who

1990
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,179
live outside this neighborhood come with

1991
01:36:54,179 --> 01:36:57,360
a set of stereotypes about pupils in

1992
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,360
these schools and that will not give

1993
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,520
them the same

1994
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,860
educational chances as people going to a

1995
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,540
school in other games

1996
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:09,480
or if your postcode is I don't know what

1997
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:12,840
is the postcode if you apply for a job

1998
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:16,080
and you okay

1999
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,260
if you apply for a joke and this is your

2000
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:20,400
address is there

2001
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,560
debt and potential employers might

2002
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,199
already come the set of stereotypes why

2003
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:26,760
not too high

2004
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:31,380
so why would it be good then to create a

2005
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:34,139
social mix well one could create or what

2006
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,600
could argue for a social mix because

2007
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,260
that will reduce the stigma located or

2008
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:44,280
the stigma attached to these things

2009
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:47,219
and of course there might also be other

2010
01:37:47,219 --> 01:37:49,920
ways to work on that stigma you don't

2011
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,139
need a mix to do that you also can make

2012
01:37:52,139 --> 01:37:53,940
people living outside this neighborhood

2013
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:55,860
which you can make them aware of

2014
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:59,780
and what has really happened inside

2015
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,239
and so but this stigmatization my

2016
01:38:03,239 --> 01:38:06,060
potential employers or teachers or

2017
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:08,280
policemen who work in these

2018
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,260
neighborhoods but who do not live there

2019
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:14,100
could be another argument as to why a

2020
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:17,460
social mix is necessary

2021
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:19,260
yes

2022
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:22,199
so are people living in impoverished is

2023
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:23,940
it well does it make does it matter

2024
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:26,400
whether you are poor enough

2025
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,159
mostly poor neighborhood surrounded by

2026
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:32,820
people like you or whether you live as a

2027
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,980
poor person in a mixed neighborhood does

2028
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,380
that matter there are seven arguments

2029
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:40,260
that I have given now as to why that

2030
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:42,060
could matter

2031
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:45,000
okay for each of these seven I've also

2032
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,560
given a couple of counter arguments

2033
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,560
as to why creating a mix could actually

2034
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,520
be a bad thing to distract the ties that

2035
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,699
exist already yeah or is not necessary

2036
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:02,460
because people find peers and Role

2037
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,860
Models outside the neighborhood

2038
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:08,040
or people will middle class people

2039
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,940
arrive in these neighborhoods will not

2040
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:14,520
create uh social networks with the

2041
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,880
people

2042
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,320
Etc so for each of these arguments I've

2043
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:24,179
given a couple of counter arguments

2044
01:39:24,179 --> 01:39:26,820
what about the privileged

2045
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:29,040
I will skip that

2046
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,679
in Tom Slater's paper you will find many

2047
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,679
arguments for that

2048
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:39,139
um I will get to a small conclusion

2049
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,600
okay so when we discuss this ideal

2050
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:45,600
social mix and we discuss the question

2051
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,960
is social mix feasible is social Mis

2052
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,620
desirable then what is my take on it I

2053
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,719
think Avis romaville

2054
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,699
who has been doing a lot of work on

2055
01:39:56,699 --> 01:40:00,060
housing here in Brussels has summarized

2056
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,920
this quite well

2057
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,980
the concept of social mixed you rights

2058
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:09,360
which now legitimizes a good part of the

2059
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,300
regional interventions in the area of

2060
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,580
housing here in Brussels she's talking

2061
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:17,400
about the Brussels capital region and

2062
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,280
how the ideal of social mix for the

2063
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,280
concept of social mix has legitimized a

2064
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,080
good part of this intervention

2065
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:28,139
is according to her not very convinced

2066
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:29,520
convinced

2067
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,020
the gentrification which is underway in

2068
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:35,699
the central neighborhoods

2069
01:40:35,699 --> 01:40:38,040
in those neighborhoods where

2070
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,100
these authorities are doing making a big

2071
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,520
effort to attract military

2072
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:47,880
indicates that when there is a mix

2073
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:51,900
it is only a Prelude to the eviction of

2074
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,420
the most disadvantaged via the

2075
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:57,120
mechanisms of a completely deregulated

2076
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:01,320
real estate markets we live in a city

2077
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:05,900
but only ten percent of the total

2078
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:09,540
residential units our social housing

2079
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:12,659
yeah there is almost no control over the

2080
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:15,000
remaining 90 percent

2081
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,820
and so if you try to attract

2082
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:20,040
middle class residents

2083
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:23,820
to this 19th century

2084
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,620
an industrial neighborhoods around

2085
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:28,260
Brussels if you do that then it will

2086
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:30,659
push out over the elsewhere you've seen

2087
01:41:30,659 --> 01:41:32,880
it in the snap of I clicking where do

2088
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,040
these poor people moving out of a

2089
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,900
gentrifying neighborhood so that they

2090
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:39,179
move to build world

2091
01:41:39,179 --> 01:41:44,300
to ask to dedicate to however

2092
01:41:44,659 --> 01:41:48,060
you move poverty elsewhere

2093
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:51,840
so when there is a mix it can exist for

2094
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,000
a while but then it's only a produced to

2095
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,800
the eviction of the most disadvantages

2096
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,460
because rents will go up eventually

2097
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,260
and these poor people that live there

2098
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,659
are not able to afford these rents I

2099
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:06,179
will need to move elsewhere to find a

2100
01:42:06,179 --> 01:42:07,139
place

2101
01:42:07,139 --> 01:42:10,320
so this social makes feasible

2102
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,920
in the case of Brussels with very little

2103
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:16,679
uh controlled of authorities on the

2104
01:42:16,679 --> 01:42:19,500
housing markets no this is not feasible

2105
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:20,880
she said

2106
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,820
is it desirable a second question that I

2107
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:26,820
asked even if this eviction could be

2108
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:30,900
avoided even if you think of a situation

2109
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:35,460
25 social housing every 50 percent and

2110
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:38,280
you will not evict this poor people from

2111
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:40,860
these neighborhoods then she argues

2112
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:43,920
there is nothing to indicate that these

2113
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,320
disadvantaged populations would

2114
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,440
eventually benefit in any way from this

2115
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,420
mix

2116
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:54,540
and why because the attraction of this

2117
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:57,300
building of families would change the

2118
01:42:57,300 --> 01:43:01,260
shops will not lead to this

2119
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:04,199
heterogeneous networks that these policy

2120
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:07,139
makers dream

2121
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:10,080
that will not lead to the kind of social

2122
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:14,540
cohesion that underlies this

2123
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:17,219
social cognition

2124
01:43:17,219 --> 01:43:19,800
does not

2125
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,500
um make the kind of role models

2126
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,900
with people who believed in this

2127
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:26,760
underclass argument

2128
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:29,580
and we're hoping for Etc

2129
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:31,739
and so she's arguing in the case of

2130
01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:34,400
Brussels again it's important to

2131
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,840
provincialize these studies and to

2132
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,460
understand the complexity of the

2133
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:41,840
Brussels case only 10 social housing

2134
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,320
poverty at this moment concentrated in

2135
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:47,940
neighborhoods with quite a good voltage

2136
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:50,760
very close to these jobs and so there

2137
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,159
are many particularities that we need to

2138
01:43:53,159 --> 01:43:55,920
understand but what she is arguing is

2139
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,560
that the kind of social mix that this

2140
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,300
Brussels Capital feature tries to tries

2141
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,880
to create leads to the displacement of

2142
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:06,060
people to neighborhoods to parts of the

2143
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:08,820
city which are much much less connected

2144
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:10,560
through job opportunities

2145
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:13,440
where you find much less shops and

2146
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,600
services

2147
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,960
Etc so too much

2148
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:21,719
worst locations actually and even if

2149
01:44:21,719 --> 01:44:23,880
this kind of mix could be realized she

2150
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,540
argues then this is not desirable and

2151
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:29,580
disadvantaged population will not

2152
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,800
benefit from this this will not help

2153
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,860
them to climb the social benefit and she

2154
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:37,679
will draw on all the seven counter

2155
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:42,199
arguments that I've given uh to uh

2156
01:44:42,199 --> 01:44:46,340
substantiate this claim

2157
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,080
so

2158
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,900
well I think when you

2159
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:55,199
I remember that I once asked an exam

2160
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,360
question such as put yourself the shoes

2161
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:00,300
of the man of Antwerp you are now the

2162
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:03,060
mayor of network but you

2163
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,020
um

2164
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:06,719
promulgate social mixed policies or not

2165
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:08,880
the question was a bit more complicated

2166
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,119
but summary I think it's important that

2167
01:45:12,119 --> 01:45:13,920
when you have such a question when you

2168
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:17,100
ever work for a city or when you need to

2169
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:19,679
discuss this from an academic point of

2170
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:21,119
view I think there are a couple of

2171
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,699
questions that you need to ask

2172
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:27,300
yeah the first one is whom are we

2173
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:29,300
talking about

2174
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:32,219
why do we treat why do we want to create

2175
01:45:32,219 --> 01:45:34,080
a social mix

2176
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,420
is it because we say well this is the

2177
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:40,139
interest under privilege or I've skipped

2178
01:45:40,139 --> 01:45:41,639
now most of this

2179
01:45:41,639 --> 01:45:43,920
a part of the class could it also be in

2180
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,320
interest of the privilege I remember we

2181
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,380
were in Prescott one of the Richard

2182
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:53,639
richer richest municipalities of Belgium

2183
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:55,980
and some of you said well it'd be good

2184
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:59,280
to have some uh more diverse details

2185
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,100
because people might for example change

2186
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:04,260
the way they think about poor people if

2187
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:07,139
they have some of them living books by

2188
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:10,199
you see that all of the arguments

2189
01:46:10,199 --> 01:46:13,199
so far have been dealing with the under

2190
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:15,600
privilege so for that reason I think

2191
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,699
it's important to ask

2192
01:46:17,699 --> 01:46:20,040
what about the crystals

2193
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,739
and in the discussion

2194
01:46:22,739 --> 01:46:24,960
seminars that we have next week there

2195
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,420
will be one paper that I've written

2196
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:29,360
together

2197
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,340
that deals with it so we have a chance

2198
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,920
to come back to this true I think I'll

2199
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,900
discussions

2200
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:40,219
do we only focus on

2201
01:46:40,219 --> 01:46:42,900
socioeconomic segregation are also are

2202
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,820
we also interested in this ethnic

2203
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:47,820
arguments have you seen for example in

2204
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:50,520
the social cohesion argument the two

2205
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,980
were conflated and so do we want to

2206
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:56,639
create a social mix in the interest of

2207
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:59,219
ethnic minorities or does the ethnic

2208
01:46:59,219 --> 01:47:00,420
majority

2209
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,940
if that still exists because more and

2210
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:05,580
more cities in Belgium do not have an

2211
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:07,920
ethnic majority

2212
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,380
but we also

2213
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:12,900
think about this group and we want to

2214
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:15,780
promulgate search boxes

2215
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:18,540
are we interested in the second

2216
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:22,139
residence who are there already or are

2217
01:47:22,139 --> 01:47:25,199
we mainly thinking about newcomers or

2218
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:26,520
arrivals

2219
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,580
and so I think this question for whom do

2220
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,679
we want to create a social effects in

2221
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:35,159
whose interests is the first one that

2222
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:36,980
you should ask

2223
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:41,400
a second one is the issue of scale

2224
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,159
I told you last week already scheduled

2225
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:46,560
is the Crux of the matter if you want to

2226
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,440
calculate segregation in dishes it

2227
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,560
matters at which scale you do so in

2228
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,940
Belgium we have this very small

2229
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:56,639
statistical units and for that reason we

2230
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:58,020
find that there's

2231
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:01,619
high levels of segregation but if you

2232
01:48:01,619 --> 01:48:04,199
would make the statistical units bigger

2233
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:07,460
then there would be less signage

2234
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:10,699
your comments about the Reds Square

2235
01:48:10,699 --> 01:48:13,320
relates to this we can create a social

2236
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:16,679
mix in this very small neighborhood and

2237
01:48:16,679 --> 01:48:19,260
if you would look at the bigger picture

2238
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,600
if you would look at this I mentioned

2239
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,840
area as a whole then you would find out

2240
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,000
that there is no social business mostly

2241
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,340
wealthy people who have settled there

2242
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:31,500
and so I think scale

2243
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:34,440
is a very important issue as well as the

2244
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,080
question where do we want to create

2245
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:38,639
assumptions

2246
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,619
I think that most of

2247
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:44,159
the social mix literature is concerned

2248
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:46,199
with this disadvantaged neighborhoods

2249
01:48:46,199 --> 01:48:49,560
the focus is on these neighborhoods and

2250
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:52,199
the need to create Associates

2251
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:54,659
if you would look at more than make you

2252
01:48:54,659 --> 01:48:56,639
would look at socio-economic position of

2253
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:58,739
people and if you would look at the

2254
01:48:58,739 --> 01:49:01,619
ethnic maker of this neighborhood you

2255
01:49:01,619 --> 01:49:03,719
will find out that modern day is maybe

2256
01:49:03,719 --> 01:49:06,420
the most socially mixed neighborhoods or

2257
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:08,760
Brussels if not Belgium

2258
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,159
and most of the homogeneous

2259
01:49:11,159 --> 01:49:14,119
neighborhoods are white Suburban

2260
01:49:14,119 --> 01:49:16,860
municipalities so why are we only

2261
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:19,860
concerned with this disadvantaged

2262
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:22,860
neighborhoods Hawaii are we not

2263
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:25,860
concerned with the homogeneity of many

2264
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:27,900
of these Suburban groups

2265
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:30,780
which are better off is there a need to

2266
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:34,020
create a social mix as well or not and

2267
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:36,360
I've inverse cards for those who joined

2268
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:38,880
to enter by talking about the way they

2269
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,040
protested against the trend against the

2270
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,119
local Asylum Center against any attempt

2271
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:47,940
to uh well to to make this

2272
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:50,940
municipality

2273
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:53,639
I could even argue that most of the

2274
01:49:53,639 --> 01:49:56,100
literature and most of the concerns of

2275
01:49:56,100 --> 01:50:00,080
policy makers Target only those

2276
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:03,320
disadvantaged neighborhoods which are

2277
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:06,780
centrifiable which have the potential to

2278
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:09,840
attract middle class newcomers because

2279
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,300
that's good for the next but then the

2280
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:15,540
question becomes rare is this possible

2281
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:19,080
and then enter we have been on this

2282
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:22,679
triangular Square Bowling plane well if

2283
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:24,300
you look at the houses there there are

2284
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:26,580
many fancy

2285
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:27,719
um houses

2286
01:50:27,719 --> 01:50:29,880
which are

2287
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:35,760
potential homes for rich uh families

2288
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,679
but if you move more to the north you

2289
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:40,980
only find very small houses which will

2290
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:42,840
never attract this kind of

2291
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,179
where do you have debates about social

2292
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:48,119
mix about the need to gentrify

2293
01:50:48,119 --> 01:50:51,080
neighborhoods well only in certain

2294
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:56,360
in a limited amount is disadvantages

2295
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:59,400
so I think this rare question is an

2296
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:02,820
important one where are we interested to

2297
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:04,199
create the solutions

2298
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:06,000
you will notice that these discussions

2299
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,820
focus on a very limited number of paper

2300
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:11,699
you know the issue is never discussed in

2301
01:51:11,699 --> 01:51:15,119
other parts of the city

2302
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:18,420
it's also important to look at the issue

2303
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:21,840
of scaling I already discussed that but

2304
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,540
here again many of our Maps only focus

2305
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:26,580
on Antwerp or the Brussels capital

2306
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:29,159
region while I've told you that many of

2307
01:51:29,159 --> 01:51:31,440
these quarterback effects

2308
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:34,020
have consequences in other parts of the

2309
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,360
urban region or even other parts of the

2310
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:39,239
country if housing prices in Brussels go

2311
01:51:39,239 --> 01:51:43,080
out business effects inshallahua this

2312
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:46,500
makes us walking around in Machinery to

2313
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,239
see the property there

2314
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:51,260
okay or we go to Chrome search

2315
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:54,300
in French quite far away from Brussels

2316
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,860
effect

2317
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:58,860
s or Nino over leading it yeah all these

2318
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:01,739
municipalities are affected by this

2319
01:52:01,739 --> 01:52:03,420
gentrification of

2320
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:05,159
us and so it's important that we discuss

2321
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:08,159
this issue at the scale of

2322
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:12,199
at least the urban region

2323
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,900
so for whom in whose interest do we want

2324
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:18,719
to create social mix where

2325
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,460
so you want to do that which

2326
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:22,260
neighborhoods are we actually talking

2327
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,219
about

2328
01:52:23,219 --> 01:52:25,440
and then I think it's also important to

2329
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,020
focus on this why question

2330
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:30,480
if you want to create a social gifts to

2331
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,520
counter poverty

2332
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,219
or even to stimulate this cultural

2333
01:52:35,219 --> 01:52:37,920
integration and I think that there might

2334
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:41,760
be many policy Alternatives which are

2335
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:42,840
less

2336
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:46,139
costly and which may have much bigger

2337
01:52:46,139 --> 01:52:48,300
effects

2338
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:50,340
yeah I'm not going to go too much into

2339
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:53,820
this but you can imagine that you can

2340
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:57,659
try to combat poverty not through the

2341
01:52:57,659 --> 01:52:59,880
spatial intervention

2342
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:03,900
but through other accounts social

2343
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:07,280
welfare Etc

2344
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:10,560
is it to improve the local Tech space

2345
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,540
we've seen this quote from this elder

2346
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:15,060
man of cats and I think for many Belgian

2347
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:17,159
cities this will be an important one why

2348
01:53:17,159 --> 01:53:21,000
do we find gentrification importance

2349
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,300
yeah and why do we want to attract the

2350
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:27,179
middle class to the city it is because

2351
01:53:27,179 --> 01:53:30,480
that is good for our Municipal budget

2352
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:33,300
yeah but then even then I will always

2353
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:35,820
eat this rhetoric of this is in the

2354
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:38,699
interest of the people that included and

2355
01:53:38,699 --> 01:53:40,920
this will eventually help them to find

2356
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:43,560
the social media

2357
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:46,800
create social mix to counter racist or

2358
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:50,880
classes stereotypes what would that mean

2359
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,360
I guess that would mean that we would

2360
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:57,179
rethink where and for whom we try to

2361
01:53:57,179 --> 01:54:00,179
create a social mix and you see that in

2362
01:54:00,179 --> 01:54:02,940
most of the policy discourse this is

2363
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:05,280
quite absent

2364
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:09,060
however if stigmatization is one of the

2365
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:14,179
reasons why living in modern day

2366
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:17,639
makes your life more difficult than

2367
01:54:17,639 --> 01:54:20,520
other parts of the city but it is about

2368
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:23,159
stigmatization and discrimination and

2369
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:25,800
what kind of spatial interventions that

2370
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,719
would be needed to counter these

2371
01:54:27,719 --> 01:54:29,659
stereotypes I think you would create

2372
01:54:29,659 --> 01:54:33,119
social media completely and different

2373
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:34,739
way

2374
01:54:34,739 --> 01:54:38,460
so this is a bit of an open-ended

2375
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:39,139
um

2376
01:54:39,139 --> 01:54:43,320
conclusion with a lot of questions but I

2377
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:44,460
hope that

2378
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:47,580
by giving you Arguments for social mix

2379
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:50,280
and counter arguments guests

2380
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:53,400
and by encouraging you to think about

2381
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,139
the context

2382
01:54:55,139 --> 01:54:58,500
in which you want to create a social mix

2383
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,719
or not that you are able to think

2384
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:03,960
critically about the effects of

2385
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:07,080
segregation and the needs to create a

2386
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:09,300
social mix or launch

2387
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,760
yeah

2388
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,480
um five plus seven I propose that

2389
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:19,619
um we almost leave it here for now we

2390
01:55:19,619 --> 01:55:21,719
still have time to discuss all these

2391
01:55:21,719 --> 01:55:25,199
issues next week in the seminar all

2392
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:27,360
these texts will deal again with

2393
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:30,179
patterns of segregation and the effects

2394
01:55:30,179 --> 01:55:32,940
of saying so I think it's good that we

2395
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:35,520
have time to discuss this

2396
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:39,119
next week Monday for the geographers

2397
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:42,480
and the people from planning and have

2398
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:45,060
awesome students is this information

2399
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:46,980
correct

2400
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:49,860
next week Monday we have eight

2401
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:53,639
papers eight presentations to discuss

2402
01:55:53,639 --> 01:55:55,400
I don't see any

2403
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:57,900
comments so I suppose that this is the

2404
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,360
schedule as it is and then next week

2405
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:04,580
Tuesday and Thursday we have two other

2406
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:08,760
seminars for students from moose

2407
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:13,320
and Thursday students from four cities

2408
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:16,020
yeah is that correct

2409
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:19,739
yes all your presentations are there you

2410
01:56:19,739 --> 01:56:22,580
find your names

2411
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:27,020
this is the information

2412
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:30,300
10 minutes

2413
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:33,420
and we will I will need to be rather

2414
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:36,560
um strict which is 10 minutes

2415
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,400
maximum

2416
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,179
especially having AIDS presentations in

2417
01:56:42,179 --> 01:56:45,420
the first seminar but also in the other

2418
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:51,719
seminars I prefer to uh keep the time

2419
01:56:51,719 --> 01:56:55,020
and to limit these presentations to 10

2420
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,639
minutes because otherwise there's not

2421
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,739
enough time for discussion these are

2422
01:56:58,739 --> 01:57:01,619
discussion seminars not presentations

2423
01:57:01,619 --> 01:57:03,840
so limit your presentations to 10

2424
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:07,020
minutes include a slide with title names

2425
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,659
email I don't know all of you so it's

2426
01:57:09,659 --> 01:57:12,060
important that I'm able to mark the

2427
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:14,040
presentations to connect this with the

2428
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:16,800
right students remember that I need a

2429
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:19,679
core court or arguments a link with the

2430
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:21,480
required readings

2431
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:24,000
remember that we also expect all

2432
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,840
students who have read all the papers of

2433
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,400
the required readings

2434
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:31,980
so I'm supposed that Slater has been

2435
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:35,520
read by Kevin Olsen and preserve and the

2436
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:38,280
textbook a chapter like what's your name

2437
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,860
and then important

2438
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:44,960
in order to not to lose too much time

2439
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,780
with technical issues I would like all

2440
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:51,360
of you to send your PowerPoints or ETF

2441
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,159
or whatever you're going to use to

2442
01:57:53,159 --> 01:57:56,099
support your presentation at least 30

2443
01:57:56,099 --> 01:57:59,340
minutes before the seminar to my email

2444
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:00,360
address

2445
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:03,239
whether we transfer link if necessary

2446
01:58:03,239 --> 01:58:06,239
and if you want me to check with the

2447
01:58:06,239 --> 01:58:10,460
presentation works on my computer

2448
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:13,800
then I suggest you to do that maybe

2449
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:16,679
already the evening before and then ask

2450
01:58:16,679 --> 01:58:19,020
me maybe check whether the PowerPoint

2451
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:22,139
approach or do it in a PDF so that's the

2452
01:58:22,139 --> 01:58:24,360
different PowerPoint versions things may

2453
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:26,599
change

2454
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:29,520
but please send them before the

2455
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:32,420
presentation so that I have the time

2456
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:37,520
so let me know whose time with swapping

2457
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:40,099
laptops and

2458
01:58:40,099 --> 01:58:42,679
laptops that can't make the connection

2459
01:58:42,679 --> 01:58:46,580
with the screen Etc

2460
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,139
just to make sure that we are all able

2461
01:58:49,139 --> 01:58:51,599
to present and that we have time to

2462
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:53,699
receivers and that will also allow us to

2463
01:58:53,699 --> 01:58:57,360
discuss everything that has been said

2464
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:00,679
and last decision

2465
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:03,239
okay then I would look forward to see

2466
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:05,110

all right

2469
01:59:49,639 --> 01:59:53,300
this is so stupid

2470
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:02,360
not talking about questions

2471
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:06,060
foreign

2472
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:38,420
thank you

2473
02:01:11,179 --> 02:01:14,239
thank you

2475
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:42,599
yes I

2476
02:01:42,599 --> 02:01:45,599
like bye

2477
02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:56,540
yes and yes

2478
02:01:58,830 --> 02:02:01,920
[Music]

2479
02:02:02,179 --> 02:02:05,179
when the first version

2480
02:02:05,179 --> 02:02:07,440
yes and then these people have been

2481
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:12,420
added to the list yes

2482
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:26,880
maybe there could be a way

2483
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:29,360
that yeah

2484
02:02:30,540 --> 02:02:34,560
if not for next week then for

2485
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:37,199
what would you prefer to do it

2486
02:02:37,199 --> 02:02:40,199
but

2487
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:51,260
yeah because now it's hard for me

2488
02:02:56,580 --> 02:02:58,220
okay yeah

2489
02:02:58,220 --> 02:03:01,329
[Music]

2490
02:03:10,619 --> 02:03:12,980
yeah

2491
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,400
I've done it next week so it's

2492
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:20,400
foreign

2493
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:46,210
[Music]

2494
02:03:52,199 --> 02:03:54,739
sure

2495
02:04:08,099 --> 02:04:12,179
so the first thing is can we call like

2496
02:04:12,179 --> 02:04:14,760
any project that things to attract

2497
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:18,480
investment or hence the apology of life

2498
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:22,139
in a neighborhood like this uh doing a

2499
02:04:22,139 --> 02:04:25,560
taxi and this kind of products can we

2500
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:28,260
call they are social mix projects

2501
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:31,260
because

2502
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,540
that's 100

2503
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,219
you still have a project

2504
02:04:44,219 --> 02:04:46,139
improve

2505
02:04:46,139 --> 02:04:49,099
public spaces

2506
02:04:58,139 --> 02:05:01,619
so like do they say that they are social

2507
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:04,440
based projects like openly

2508
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:07,260
so in some of these I've shown you some

2509
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:11,659
some parts from policy games

2510
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:17,520
okay

2511
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:20,159
in order to attract another kind of

2512
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:21,900
presence

2513
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:24,320
yes

2514
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,619
do you have any other if you have

2515
02:05:34,619 --> 02:05:37,679
already used some references that talk

2516
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:39,980
about Brussels

2517
02:05:39,980 --> 02:05:42,540
in the presentation I haven't shown that

2518
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:43,440
but

2519
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,659
there is quite a rich people Geography

2520
02:05:45,659 --> 02:05:48,599
okay so it finally shows papers I will

2521
02:05:48,599 --> 02:05:50,099
find something well I think you will

2522
02:05:50,099 --> 02:05:52,380
find a lot of women who benefits from

2523
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:54,179
home ownership support policies in

2524
02:05:54,179 --> 02:05:55,980
Brussels that's where this this quote

2525
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:58,280
comes from

2526
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:00,840
clicking and moving in out of Brussels

2527
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:03,540
much of his work is on gentrification

2528
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:05,159
but you will also see that some of his

2529
02:06:05,159 --> 02:06:06,599
papers deal with

2530
02:06:06,599 --> 02:06:09,060
social mix in relation to uh

2531
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:12,179
gentrification specifically so there's a

2532
02:06:12,179 --> 02:06:14,420
lot of work

2533
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:17,099
yeah from here

2534
02:06:17,099 --> 02:06:19,619
uh and the other thing that I don't know

2535
02:06:19,619 --> 02:06:21,179
if I'm mistaken but I have the

2536
02:06:21,179 --> 02:06:23,940
impression that there is not actually

2537
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:27,420
evidence that social actually works like

2538
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:30,060
you presented some arguments

2539
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:32,760
but they're not

2540
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,880
recorded life is

2541
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:38,940
more like suppositions and

2542
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:42,900
well I think the infamous

2543
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:46,400
trying to find out the

2544
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,960
effects and and showing that there are

2545
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:51,119
some cases where

2546
02:06:51,119 --> 02:06:53,219
people might benefit from such things

2547
02:06:53,219 --> 02:06:56,420
but even any questions

2548
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:01,560
mixed neighborhood so it's quite costly

2549
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:04,219
yes what would happen

2550
02:07:04,219 --> 02:07:07,560
the structural problems if you reduce

2551
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:09,360
all this money to

2552
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,440
try and comment over

2553
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:14,820
again so even

2554
02:07:14,820 --> 02:07:19,159
turns out social response

2555
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:26,580
just yeah so so even even if you could

2556
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:29,760
turn out that by creating social mix you

2557
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:31,440
improve

2558
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,719
the situation

2559
02:07:33,719 --> 02:07:36,780
any questions that is what would happen

2560
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:37,800
so

2561
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:40,320
it should try and attack it

2562
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:43,820
it's not through spatial

2563
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:47,699
we're trying to okay

2564
02:07:47,699 --> 02:07:50,599
yes

2565
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,800
thank you

2566
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:58,800
improving schools

2567
02:08:05,179 --> 02:08:07,980
we have also time to discuss next next

2568
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:10,760
yes

2569
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:19,609
[Applause]
