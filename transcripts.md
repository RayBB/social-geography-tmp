# 1 Introduction: Urban geographical tradition(s)

1
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,980
thank you

2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,600
all right

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,879
welcome everybody

4
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,320
to

5
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,379
urban geography Urban social geography I

6
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,020
had to work a little bit to make the

7
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,219
live stream work I hope it does work

8
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,600
does anybody mind if I take off my mask

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,099
is that okay

10
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,979
if anybody's uncomfortable just let me

11
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:08,760
know

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,540
but I rely on my facial expressions

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,140
for Content uh how do you say that to

14
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,659
transfer content if you will

15
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,000
um so hi I'm David uh I'll be your

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,140
lecturer

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,439
and welcome to the course

18
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,140
um I'm very glad that we can

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,680
teach and have this uh in real life in

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,420
person

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,060
um I'll tell you more about

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,740
um the kind of hybrid character because

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,259
we'll also be recording the sessions and

24
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,360
live streaming this session

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,720
so I think the pandemic pandemic

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,680
conditions are still ongoing to allow if

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
you would doubt about any infection Etc

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,700
to follow the course remotely

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,119
uh I think this can be more evident I

30
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,100
think for the for the regular lectures

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,560
like we have today

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
um there's also a number of discussion

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,340
seminars there it will be a bit less

34
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,739
evident uh and there's also excursions

35
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,819
for some in there yeah I mean uh I can't

36
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,340
stream an Excursion uh but for the

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,840
lectures it will be an alternative and

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,080
you also have a recording at the end

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,660
um of the lecture series and this could

40
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,900
be an interesting instrument to study

41
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,300
um so yeah that's also how students have

42
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,640
used it last year

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,540
okay so what are the objectives of the

44
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,819
entire course urban geography or Urban

45
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,400
social geography well just summed up

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,300
there

47
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,300
I won't go too to deep into this uh just

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,519
here and now but just that you know what

49
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,580
you're signing up for uh for the people

50
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,040
that are still uh shopping around I

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,660
would say

52
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,400
um the objective of the course is to

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,379
give an introduction to key theoretical

54
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,019
debates in urban studies more

55
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,379
specifically uh focusing on spatial and

56
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,860
geographical dimensions hence it's not

57
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,420
um introduction to Urban studies but

58
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,780
introduction to Urban Geography

59
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,260
and and this is kind of uh kind of

60
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,940
signaling what we find important as

61
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,019
lecturers

62
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,780
to adopt a theoretically pluralist

63
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,180
approach toward Urban studies

64
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,400
you'll see that and I'll get to that in

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,720
a second that we work with different

66
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,480
teachers lectures we all have their own

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
backgrounds and they may be slightly

68
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,019
different some people work more on a

69
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,060
political economy perspective others

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,239
start from adopting a perspective from

71
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,060
diversity ethnicity yet others are

72
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,739
interested in

73
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,220
uh issues of culture then the broad

74
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,680
sense and others work in a kind of

75
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,540
Mobility framework and we'll try to

76
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,540
bring those things together in one

77
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,060
course but what is kind of uniting the

78
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,860
course that I think a spatial social

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,560
spatial understanding of contemporary

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,620
cities okay so that's what you're

81
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,840
signing up for if you hate cities this

82
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,840
is the moment to leave the room

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,620
um I Told You So So This Is The Old Mill

84
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,120
panel

85
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,940
um that we present you my sincerest

86
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,260
apologies

87
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,899
um but I think that hopefully diversity

88
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,180
across the curriculum is a bit better

89
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,120
than within this course but

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,540
um we're selecting from the people that

91
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,900
that can teach so please accept my

92
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,820
apologies for that but still we hope

93
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,600
that we can inform you from a range of

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,759
perspectives uh also including I would

95
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,220
say feminist perspectives and they will

96
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,979
pop up here and there

97
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,320
especially when we start talking about

98
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,080
issues of culture and issues of mobility

99
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,520
and transmit but you see those

100
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Dimensions returning so who is part of

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,160
the teaching team well that's next few

102
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,360
months he's an expert in issues of

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,580
segregation and living in diversity both

104
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,860
from her

105
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,240
he is an expert you could say in

106
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,400
Creative Industries cultural geographies

107
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,220
of the cities of the city boytech

108
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,500
goblovsky

109
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,320
he wrote a PhD on fairfree public

110
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,620
transportation and he's an expert in

111
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,740
urban studies slash transportation

112
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,800
geographies and recently is really

113
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,220
pushing for kind of the colonial

114
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,560
agenda in transport geographies and

115
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,419
finally there's me

116
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,520
um I Won't Say I'm an expert in anything

117
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,680
I'm an expert in coordinating this

118
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,620
course by now uh and I come from a

119
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,380
background of world and Global cities so

120
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,479
what happens to cities amid

121
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,139
globalization uh how should we study

122
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,759
that analyze that well on the main

123
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,780
debates

124
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,360
and personally I've been looking a lot

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,020
into the geographies of Islamic Finance

126
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,660
as a way to understand I would say

127
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,600
Middle Eastern processes of urbanization

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,780
but that was my PhD currently I'm more

129
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,400
working in teams around Financial

130
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,060
geographies more widely thinking about

131
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,699
what typifies Global cities as command

132
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,680
and control centers all kind of things

133
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,840
that I'll be killing you with in the

134
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,120
next few sessions so I won't say

135
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,280
anything more about that so that's the

136
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,720
teaching team

137
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,400
and so this plural voices to some extent

138
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,000
and also there's also a plural audience

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,660
um so I was already referring to groups

140
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,120
of students uh by pointing to that this

141
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,160
is the urban social geography course but

142
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,720
also it's also the urban geography

143
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,060
Course and there are slight differences

144
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,759
between both courses but especially for

145
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,000
uh the lectures that makes complete

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,960
sense

147
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,300
um to to bring you together in a room so

148
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,120
we have the master in urban studies they

149
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,759
will be a master please raise your hands

150
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,280
and voices

151
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,000
okay thanks for the hands

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,340
uh this for citizens

153
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,940
yeah so that's even more exotic these

154
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,800
people travel around Europe in the next

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
two years

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
uh then we have our own exotic species

157
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,080
uh from The Bachelor of geography uh

158
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,660
maybe raise your hand

159
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,780
welcome and we also have

160
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,120
um urbanists in the room

161
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,720
um so please show me where you are these

162
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,639
people also combine this with with an

163
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,259
actual job uh so that's also why we

164
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,139
teach at night to accommodate that and

165
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,460
these are people that have quite a bit

166
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,800
of professional expertise so I would say

167
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,280
this is already a global Urban map here

168
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,460
uh confined in this room

169
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,940
um I would say enjoy this mix and try to

170
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,460
pick each other's brains as much as

171
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,620
possible I think just by comparing Urban

172
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,300
experiences

173
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,639
Supreme casual conversation you can

174
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
already learn quite a bit I would say

175
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
so similarities

176
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,419
um

177
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,620
all students have lectures and

178
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,080
discussion seminars this discussion

179
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,360
seminar for capacity reasons will be

180
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,699
split but I'll tell you more about that

181
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,580
for urban social geographers so that's

182
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,199
what mass and urban studies and for

183
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,440
Citizens we're kind of new to Belgium

184
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,880
uh we also offer kinds of excursions and

185
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,380
I'll say more about that as well and

186
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,099
these are mandatory fun

187
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,339
so how does the course look like uh

188
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,339
there's nine lectures

189
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,860
which we will try to make as interactive

190
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,740
as possible but there will be a degree

191
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,980
of me and US telling you stuff the

192
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,220
discussion seminars will be way more uh

193
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,080
flipped if you will where the content is

194
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,040
prepared by by you and then we discuss

195
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,459
this in the classroom so it's a bit of a

196
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:13,260
give and take there

197
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,540
we organized the

198
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,300
um the lectures in modules so you could

199
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,720
say there's four modules one organized

200
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
by me which deals with a general

201
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,060
introduction as you'll note today and

202
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,420
then we'll delve into theories

203
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,140
of world and Global cities looking at

204
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,019
what explains their Genesis what their

205
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,959
characteristics are uh why it matters

206
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,779
and what kind of the main processes are

207
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,440
that characterize Urban Societies in

208
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,660
world and Global cities and one of the

209
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,700
main debates there is

210
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,440
to what extent are these places

211
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,240
polarized

212
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
either in terms of ethnicity income

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,800
levels professional levels Etc

214
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,300
with depth Sensitivity I would say to

215
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,459
uneven is within cities uh I'll pass on

216
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,740
the word to an experiments

217
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,320
we'll focus more on processes of urban

218
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,839
segregation we're looking at the spatial

219
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,120
processes behind that

220
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,480
and one of the main debates I would say

221
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,700
in uh issues of diversity and ethnicity

222
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,060
is to what extent there are neighborhood

223
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,140
effects

224
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,300
is the fact that you live within a

225
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,240
certain neighborhood affecting your

226
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,779
future trajectories life chances Etc so

227
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:40,560
that's one of the main debates there and

228
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,800
there's pros and cons there's Arguments

229
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,959
for and against the existence of

230
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,300
neighborhood effects

231
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,579
um then we passed on to uh boss from

232
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,680
Hood who will be talking about uh you

233
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,320
could say the cultural approach

234
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,140
uh thinking about different cultures of

235
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,019
urban research and then so this deals

236
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,360
with various methods and mostly with you

237
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,959
could say uh an older cultural turn uh

238
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,940
within geography in the social sciences

239
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,640
more widely which was took place after

240
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,320
the second world war and then more

241
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,959
recently in the 80s and 90s okay the

242
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,380
real cultural turn where was all about

243
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,540
um a turn towards more qualitative

244
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,720
research methods other sources uh that

245
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,459
that could be studied and that could

246
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,160
serve the study herbis Urban societies

247
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,100
and then this is also mobilized in the

248
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,839
study of urban cultures where it's about

249
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,779
creative Industries the lives of artists

250
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,480
Etc which is a big element in a lot of

251
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,079
I'd say discourses on the creative city

252
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,339
as you may know the work of Richard

253
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,279
Florida it was all hype I would say 20

254
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,300
years ago that all cities should be

255
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,040
geared toward becoming creative in one

256
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,279
way or another so hence also large focus

257
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,339
on the literature on issues of arts and

258
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,740
culture as it is connected to the issues

259
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,260
of Urban Development

260
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,740
and the final part is with vojtek

261
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,899
blovsky

262
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:13,740
looking into through the lens of of

263
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,839
transport and mobility and what we can

264
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,360
learn about cities and he will be

265
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,060
talking about different kinds of agendas

266
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,560
that's typify I would say

267
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,779
transport studies all the way from

268
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,940
neoclassical views that connected to

269
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,480
Urban growth development to

270
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,519
sustainability issues which is a

271
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,980
paradigm in an office Zone and then

272
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,140
he'll be yeah drawing on his own

273
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,139
research looking more into what he calls

274
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,839
critical perspectives on Urban transport

275
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,600
where it's all about yeah who actually

276
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,000
benefits from the current Transportation

277
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,300
regime what are issues of inequality who

278
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,060
makes uh decisions about in Transport

279
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,700
Systems Etc so

280
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,920
I think by the end you should have a

281
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,240
kind of a 360 degree overview of uh of

282
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,660
debates in urban geography obviously

283
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,480
um we don't know everything far from

284
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,480
that so it's a selection of debates

285
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,480
um we could generate another curriculum

286
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,060
based with other forms of expertise but

287
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,000
it's also an exercise in trying to

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,980
um critically triangulate different

289
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,959
perspectives on the city through

290
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,760
different kind of tips which come with

291
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,240
their own methodologies Etc so that's uh

292
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,399
the setup of the course

293
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,880
and these take place here uh you just

294
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,279
about fit in this room so I'm extremely

295
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,060
happy and pleased and will take place on

296
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,839
Mondays between five and seven

297
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,459
um let's see what the quality of the

298
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,339
streaming is uh I if I would open

299
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,380
panopto which is my program I could

300
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,920
expect a stream of comments about that

301
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,959
but so I'll evaluate that but the the

302
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,240
idea is that everything is streamed as

303
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,459
well people that can't make it because

304
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,760
of yeah conflicts with work

305
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,220
um or well they might have time but

306
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,740
can't reach VB because it's immediately

307
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,100
uh after uh the working day I mean I

308
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,260
would understand that you would

309
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,139
um yeah follow remotely

310
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,320
um and sessions will also be recorded

311
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,660
on the other hand it's a kind of strict

312
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,240
recommendation to try to be here as much

313
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,360
as possible because I mean one of the

314
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,420
insights from the corona crisis yeah

315
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,199
when you watch remotely sometimes it's

316
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,899
hard to maintain discipline I also

317
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,060
recognize that with all kinds of zoomy

318
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,040
things and zoom

319
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
um I don't know seminars

320
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,040
so having a habit of coming to vud

321
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,019
coming to class I think it's also a way

322
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,180
to stay connected not only to the course

323
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,639
content but also to one another so

324
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,920
you could uh fall back on this but I

325
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,680
would not recommend uh a full digital

326
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,519
semester uh in any case so but it's it's

327
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,680
there and it will be your resource if

328
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,959
all goes well uh at the very end

329
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,060
so yeah we're here

330
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,300
a bit more on the discussion seminar so

331
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,820
yes please there was a question

332
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,120
foreign

333
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,980
yeah it's to have some slack uh in this

334
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,920
room we'll aim for two hours but we

335
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,600
already started like five minutes late

336
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,339
today

337
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,420
um so don't uh be upset if we take until

338
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,240
10 past seven but the idea is that it

339
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,399
would be two hours

340
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,620
um yeah depends a bit on what happens

341
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,100
yes

342
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,240
Excuse me

343
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,459
yes I'll post them online after each

344
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,839
session

345
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:01,980
um

346
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,680
yeah and if you go to the canvas page

347
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,060
and I guess some of you are not yet

348
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,459
uh be able to access uh come with us but

349
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,740
that should be resorted quite soon

350
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,160
you'll see at the starting page and I

351
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,320
made all kinds of modules there's a kind

352
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,300
of an outline module and there's a

353
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,920
module per session

354
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,380
where you'll see

355
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,199
um the required readings some additional

356
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,860
readings outposts a link to

357
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,019
um no I won't do it there I'll post a

358
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,720
link to the recordings any announcements

359
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,620
there will be session slides linked to

360
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,320
um to each of these modules so I mean I

361
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,300
think it's neatly organized so you

362
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,880
should find your way there basically all

363
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,759
content will be provided online for

364
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,519
people that cannot access

365
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,639
um canvas yet

366
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,940
please find somebody who has access and

367
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,500
try to share I would say the course

368
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,360
outline

369
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,660
um so please be aware that some of you

370
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,880
don't have access yet I think by next

371
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,059
week it should be okay

372
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,819
so yeah let's see

373
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,040
so yeah next to the lectures

374
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,980
um there's discussion seminars where we

375
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,859
basically use the reader

376
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,079
um to advance our insights into these

377
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,900
discussions around urban geography and

378
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,120
we take the various modules so four

379
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,980
modules and we organize that in one

380
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,200
block where we'll have a discussion

381
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,799
which is basically prepared by uo and

382
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,620
different kind of smaller presentations

383
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,059
and then we have a collective discussion

384
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,320
about

385
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,320
uh it's also in the outline so it's a

386
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,179
different kind of series of discussion

387
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,640
seminars because you can't have a debate

388
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,860
with 200 people in the room

389
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,500
uh so it's more like a classroom format

390
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,840
uh one for the master in urban studies

391
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,140
one track for four cities and then uh

392
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,660
also one for geographers and urbanists

393
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,340
and one go

394
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,400
um for mus and for cities it won't be on

395
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,500
Mondays it's on different times uh

396
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,500
during the week it's in uh your time

397
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,700

please check uh if you've already

399
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,679
identified where the time schedule is

400
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,400
also when the room information is

401
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,380
um and try to notice down in your agenda

402
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,760
because there will be an assignment

403
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,340
later that a small one but I would say

404
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,919
an important one okay please note that

405
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,820
down in your return

406
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,000
um also note that the lectures at some

407
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,740
point will have three lectures now but

408
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,020
then we will Skip One Week

409
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,140
uh before we go to the next module then

410
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,780
two classes then we Skip One Week etc

411
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,840
etc and it is because on certain Mondays

412
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,120
after module will have a discussion

413
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,360
seminar with geographers and urbanists

414
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,120
because it's we can't expect work

415
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,240
students to be here during the day

416
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,400
um so we will take these Mondays and

417
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,460
also please take notes for uh

418
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,799
myths and four cities that you don't

419
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,260

420
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,840

seminars for another group okay just so

424
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,179
you know it could be a week also to

425
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,400
prepare a little bit more uh for the

426
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,440
discussion seminar that you you may have

427
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,940
yourself

428
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,640
okay I'll say more about the assignment

429
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,860
link to that in a second then Urban

430
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,440
social geography excursions uh there's a

431
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,260
lot of administration here apparently

432
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,980
um

433
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,440
we offer four excursions but because of

434
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,419
the size of the group this is for Miss

435
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,200
and for cities uh we'll have to

436
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,220
um yeah force you to make a short Choice

437
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,620
um so there's four excursions one uh led

438
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,660
by me here in Brussels which deal with

439
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,179
Brussels as a global City uh next few

440
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,520
months takes you to Antwerp to deal with

441
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,120
issues of Social and ethnic segregation

442
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,400
Minds that this is a bike trip so maybe

443
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,580
some of you are less comfortable with uh

444
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,860
biking just taken to this into account

445
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,840
others may be extremely experienced and

446
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,059
fight the rates uh too slow and also

447
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,100
don't want to join

448
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,860
um then there's an Excursion to show

449
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,400
everyone Again by Nick

450
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,260
and then wojtek will take you on

451
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,960
Excursion in Brussels around the team of

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,740
everyday Mobility

453
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,000
um so for excursions you have to choose

454
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,860
two

455
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,200
um this is also something that I I um

456
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,620
mentioned in this uh Google Sheets or

457
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,419
spreadsheets

458
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,120
um please try to go for one Brussels

459
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,100
Excursion and one other Excursion

460
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,720
because we want to kind of give

461
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,059
everybody the opportunity to go beyond

462
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,520
Brussels otherwise your remain stuck in

463
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,039
the Brussels bubble uh so there's please

464
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,679
select either Antwerp I would say or

465
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,059
either Charlotte yes the hunter bike

466
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,059
trip is actually like right here by

467
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,220
people from Russell's pointer no okay

468
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,799
you go by train and then

469
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,260
I don't think it's even the entire day

470
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,539
but at some point you'll go to the

471
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,059
locked Bowl which is kind of a

472
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,360
social housing product project from I

473
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,320
think the 60s if I'm not mistaken uh and

474
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,679
to reach that you'll go by by bike

475
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,400
um

476
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,260
yeah some people feel less comfortable

477
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,659
doing that uh

478
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:42,539
you could also say we have uh one month

479
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,380
to get trained uh so in any case it

480
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,059
could be an opportunity but take this

481
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,539
into account uh yes it was a question

482
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,320
and bring our own way no no no no no no

483
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,200
no no no no yeah well there's a bike

484
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,260
rental yeah Nick has arranged bikes are

485
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,640
there any other questions about this

486
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,640
uh not yet no uh but typically I mean

487
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,799
this would be communicated they start in

488
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,480
the early morning and the end at the end

489
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,620
of the day

490
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,340
um

491
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,860
yeah so it's a full day

492
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,600
see

493
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,900
okay

494
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,580
so please uh go to this um spreadsheet

495
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,020
and fill out your preferences

496
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,520
all right

497
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,340
okay I hope this uh the skills it

498
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,220
and fill out your preferences uh as soon

499
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,000
as possible and no later than next week

500
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,880
okay so there's limited capacity for

501
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,320
each of these

502
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,780
um excursions

503
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,960
so please uh take care of it

504
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,240
all right a bit more about the course

505
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,039
materials

506
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,360
um as you will see on canvas there's a

507
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,179
reader with what I call required reading

508
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,179
so I expect everybody

509
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:17,460
reach this at least once and preferably

510
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,460
in advance of advance of each lecture

511
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,799
it's a kind of way to keep track of of

512
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,120
the discussion

513
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,679
and there will also be additional

514
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,960
readings and these additional readings

515
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,700
will kind of be the resource that we

516
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,510
will use in the discussion seminars

517
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,240
[Music]

518
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,960
um

519
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,840
yeah the rest I've said already

520
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,100
um session slides and recordings

521
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,240
available after each session

522
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,179
and then this is weird and then

523
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,240
um yeah you'll have access via compost a

524
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,220
bit more about evaluation and great

525
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,380
distribution

526
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,260
so this assignment in the discussion

527
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,940
seminar

528
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,860
um is

529
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,220
um a critical summary and it accounts

530
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,580
for one-fifth of your total grade so

531
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,140
it's a kind of uh

532
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,960
a way to to be remunerated if you will

533
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,780
for your efforts during the semester but

534
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,539
the whole idea is that we digest our way

535
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,460
through

536
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,780
the literature and through the reader

537
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,799
that we do this in a collective way

538
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,380
um so what is the assignment

539
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,720
um all students have to read the

540
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,720
required readings but then

541
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,780
um

542
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,659
I have no idea what to do actually

543
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:44,419
uh let me just check this is off

544
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,010
[Music]

545
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:00,020
yeah no idea

546
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,340
okay let's let's just try to continue

547
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,360
um

548
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,940
so part two you'll be invited to

549
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,400
critically summarize one additional

550
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,820
reading so it could be a paper on Beirut

551
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,200
for instance when we're talking about

552
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,419
global cities

553
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:19,919
and

554
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,240
um

555
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,120
yeah I'll announce the schedule uh for

556
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,980
that you'll have 10 minutes of

557
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,419
presentation

558
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:30,720
and what you're asked to do is that you

559
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,779
focus on a core quote or uh passage or

560
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,000
excerpt from the text that you kind of

561
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,799
use this as an introduction to the text

562
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,020
that you tell us all about the main

563
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,419
argument of the authors

564
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,059
that you connect this to The Wider

565
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,740
debate to the literature that we've been

566
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,779
discussing yeah we've been talking about

567
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,659
world and Global cities yeah what how do

568
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,120
you connect that to this particular

569
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,940
study that we're reading about and then

570
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,799
toward the end you want to give some

571
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,600
kind of a critical critical reflection

572
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,760
so you can also start with the critical

573
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,740
reflection and weave that through the

574
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,840
entire presentation but you should end

575
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,539
with a number of discussion questions uh

576
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,059
which we can use to kick start the

577
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,760
debate so 10 minutes you give kind of a

578
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,480
crash course summary of what the paper

579
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,700
is about why it matters what we learn

580
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,600
from it and how we connect that to to

581
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,120
the discussions that we already have

582
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,279
so that's the critical summary a bit

583
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,140
more on that second I'm sorry

584
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,539
yes okay yeah because otherwise it will

585
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,720
be an endless stream of presentations

586
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,779
it's something that you can do with two

587
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,940
um so yeah it's a and and both of you

588
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,279
should uh take the floor at some point

589
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,679
yeah so the idea is that it's a bit of a

590
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,919
balanced exercise and also try to make

591
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,460
this an integrated exercise not somebody

592
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,500
one person saying okay this is the

593
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,360
argument but then the other person not

594
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,220
knowing the argument but having come up

595
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,659
with with the neural questions so to

596
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,039
give a stupid example that's not the

597
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,900
idea so it really try to discuss the

598
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,380
text together and come to some kind of a

599
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,820
shared understanding there and already

600
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,520
debating this amongst the two of you

601
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,679
would already be something worthwhile I

602
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,840
think

603
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,520
yeah

604
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,500
yeah the largest part of the evaluation

605
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,779
is a written exam

606
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,299
and this is basically

607
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,419
um a way to test you could say your

608
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,580
knowledge of urban of the urban theories

609
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,440
and Concepts that we've been discussing

610
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,380
throughout the semester throughout the

611
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,960
different modules

612
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,539
there's no uh particular focus on

613
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:45,240
memorizing things by heart but it's

614
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,000
about

615
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,039
mobilizing your knowledge to study

616
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:53,600
empirical examples cases Etc

617
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,159
and I think we'll give examples of that

618
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,039
throughout the course

619
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,870
for instance when you think about

620
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,220
[Music]

621
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,120
um

622
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,200
culture as an as a

623
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,960
say Urban Development strategy you may

624
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,960
get a question about okay there's a new

625
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,380
soundtrack

626
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,740
next to the Brussels Canal Zone to what

627
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,520
extent is this a a case of cultural and

628
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,400
regeneration

629
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,919
discuss and then you would would have to

630
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,980
interpret the case on that base so it's

631
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,500
not just about reproduction that's about

632
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,539
applying what you've learned critically

633
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,539
reflecting on the different concepts Etc

634
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,480
and you'll use the readings the slides

635
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,900
the recordings personal notes from

636
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,900
seminars and lectures and yeah those who

637
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,779
went on a disc on an Excursion can also

638
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:54,000
always refer to

639
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,080
um to the filters to actually get a bit

640
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,179
of more inspiration

641
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,360
so that's uh the setup of the great

642
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,460
distribution

643
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,159
um and yeah a bit more still about this

644
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,440
critical summary

645
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,360
um just a number of questions that you

646
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,140
could use as a source of information

647
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,700
inspiration or a template

648
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,539
so what is the key message from the

649
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,940
paper why is it important what is the

650
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,539
key argument uh what have you learned

651
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,980
and really try to be as nuanced as

652
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,260
possible can you compare the argument

653
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,980
being made with other perspectives or a

654
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,899
perspective from the required readings

655
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,440
or anything

656
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,399
foreign

657
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,559
important

658
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:48,080
yeah this is getting a bit weird now

659
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,460
yeah I have no idea

660
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,679
when I move I have the impression

661
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,500
um

662
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,840
okay let's try uh to continue

663
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,949
[Music]

664
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,220
yeah okay

665
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,240
I wonder what would happen if I would

666
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,299
push the out button but then I think

667
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,500
maybe

668
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,240
you know it might be singles or

669
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,380
something

670
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,899
yeah okay

671
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,220
do you really think that would be the

672
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,960
case yeah

673
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,840
yeah interference but everybody switch

674
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,779
off their phones is that an option it's

675
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,419
like 100 phones being switched off is

676
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:51,679
that possible to try yeah

677
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,080
but I don't really find it I think it's

678
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,159
necessary

679
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,200
yeah

680
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,299
but yeah

681
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:03,120
I think that's the most I can do

682
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
actually

683
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,960
maybe yeah let's try okay maybe we'll

684
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,299
have to live with it or I can sort it

685
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,399
out later

686
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,520
um

687
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,700
what happens if I

688
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,419
go this one

689
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,240
foreign

690
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,470
[Music]

691
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:00,500
excuse me

692
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,860
unknowingly

693
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,600
okay I'm not a genius this is clear by

694
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,220
now

695
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,880
um

696
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,000
all right uh and um yeah final point

697
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,059
that I already set this uh try something

698
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,360
um the debate that's that's what uh what

699
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,980
it's all about in the end okay

700
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,320
no you have to do this one

701
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,360
one so what I'll do as soon as I have

702
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,980
the full overviews who had actually

703
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,980
taking this course but make a schedule

704
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,620
uh and then you'll have to present once

705
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,080
yeah with somebody else

706
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,140
um

707
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,779
campus or

708
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,399
um it's not on canvas it's a different

709
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,820
kind of Google Sheets but you can click

710
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,220
the link in the in the slides that I

711
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,020
just uh showed so yeah

712
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,039
um

713
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,020
for those who don't have access to

714
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,140
converse uh maybe ask somebody who has

715
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,260
to share this link or just ask somebody

716
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,740
to to sign you up uh via this link

717
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,299
um okay

718
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,580
is that clear

719
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,559
there's a whole lot of administration

720
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:23,340
sorry for that uh but that's how it goes

721
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,559
I guess so I hope everything is clear

722
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,100
yes please

723
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,440
yeah but I'll make the the distribution

724
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,620
oh yeah because otherwise if we do this

725
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,240
bottom up then

726
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,840
it will be very very difficult uh so

727
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,899
I'll yeah but all texts are interesting

728
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,519
I would say

729
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,360
um

730
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,360
so so that's the idea but uh it might

731
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,820
take a while because I think for for

732
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,980
most and four cities it's quite clear so

733
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,960
that could go fast maybe for geographers

734
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,200
and uh stat it could last a little bit

735
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,940
longer because sometimes it's unclear

736
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,320
who is actually in the course but for

737
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,940
most unfortunately I think this can go

738
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,679
actually quite fast and then you can

739
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,139
also plan a little bit uh work in the

740
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,460
semester

741
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,260
um okay

742
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,879
together

743
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,320
all right

744
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,119
so uh let's turn to some content then

745
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,399
uh and let's start our trip

746
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,960
what we'll be discussing in Earth today

747
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,760
is basically what we'll do is we'll

748
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,440
deconstruct uh the title course

749
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,619
um and ask four questions

750
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,839
what is the Urban

751
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,060
what is the city

752
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,099
what is geography

753
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:50,580
and what does it mean when I say I'm

754
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,020
critical

755
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,060
arguably critical is not in the title

756
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,460
but it could have been right

757
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,240
it may seem consensible but I think

758
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,180
asking these very blue sky questions

759
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,180
perhaps uh could get us closer to an

760
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,740
understanding what urban geography is

761
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,599
about so you can also start already

762
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,060
start thinking a little bit about

763
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,820
what we would mean with the term the

764
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,420
urban and uh the city

765
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,119
maybe as I take you to a number of

766
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,359
exhibits you can draw some inspiration

767
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,760
for that and you can make a list and

768
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,619
then in a few minutes you'll be invited

769
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,680
to write a very short one minute paper

770
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,839
it doesn't have to be Pros where you

771
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,579
collect a little bit of ideas on what

772
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:39,560
those two terms could be okay

773
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,520
probably and one of the reasons why some

774
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,000
of you have studied uh or selected the

775
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,980
master in urban studies for four cities

776
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,660
is because you have been seduced by a

777
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,060
discourse or a frame of we live in the

778
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,540
urban age processes occur increasingly

779
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,280
in cities therefore we need to

780
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,079
understand cities if we want to make

781
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,540
sense of our futures or something like

782
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,180
that and this would be some kind of a

783
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,700
framework or repertoire

784
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,700
um that the world uh that United Nations

785
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,440
sorry calls a framework of the urban age

786
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,380
and it's a kind of frame that says well

787
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,500
we've long been a you could say rural

788
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,460
global population or a rural species but

789
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,599
at some point and someday in 2005 we

790
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,740
became an urban species and ever since

791
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,660
uh basically world population growth

792
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,920
will be Urban growth so increasingly we

793
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,140
are undergoing as a global Society a

794
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,839
process of urbanization where more and

795
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,880
more people

796
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,579
become Urban so this kind of Mantra of

797
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,520
the urban age has been around since

798
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,180
about 2007 so immediately after this

799
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,960
historical Urban transition

800
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,820
and it has been repeated as a kind of a

801
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,700
motivation for increased attention at

802
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,920
the cities so and there's something

803
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,320
behind that obviously because there is

804
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,200
indeed a transition to the urban and

805
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,320
this observable here empirically roughly

806
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,980
in the 1950s about 70 percent of of the

807
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,740
population global population lived in

808
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,640
rural areas and only 30 percent in urban

809
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,420
areas it was 50 50 apparently around

810
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,560
2005 and now it's reversed uh or it's

811
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,500
going to be reversed by 2050 expectation

812
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,740
is that 70 of the global population will

813
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,380
live in cities okay

814
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,440
so that's kind of the framework of the

815
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,220
urban age that is very much kind of uh

816
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,680
projected by the United Nations by all

817
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,240
kinds of uh world uh World reports and

818
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,220
that is kind of taken over by both

819
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,099
critical and more uncritical uh voices

820
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,440
in the debate

821
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,960
McKinsey would also use this to argue

822
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,839
for more consultancy into uh urban

823
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,160
government or something

824
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,060
but it's just as much Mike Davis when he

825
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,480
talks about uh cities of slums he'll use

826
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,240
this as a critical framework to refer to

827
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,079
make his kind of his work important

828
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,960
so what is behind this is an assumed

829
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,820
process or an identifiable process of

830
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,500
globalized urbanization so the process

831
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,760
by which

832
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,640
the urban condition if you will is

833
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,160
becoming a global phenomenon

834
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,579
and urbanization used to be something

835
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,099
that was not Global at all and if you

836
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:53,720
look at a few maps by Michael patrolling

837
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,660
uh who has a great handbook uh on on

838
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,040
cities

839
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,740
you see that it was very much say a

840
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,520
Western European or Northern American

841
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,160
Affair so UK

842
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,339
was extremely urbanized European

843
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:12,540
continents

844
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,800
also quite and the us as well apparently

845
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,480
Alaska was also extremely urbanized

846
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,579
the rest of the world was on the map but

847
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:27,119
not really on the map of urbanization uh

848
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,680
it didn't occurred there

849
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,599
fast forward to the 1950s you see that

850
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,480
this process is spreading uh especially

851
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,760
you could say throughout the European

852
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,740
continents throughout the Commonwealth

853
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,839
you see Australia and Canada popping up

854
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,780
also I could say more

855
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,300
developmentalists say to Latin America

856
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,400
uh USSR

857
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,839
and uh to a very very limited extent uh

858
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,380
Africa and then especially the market

859
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,040
not so much in Asia as you can see

860
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,400
we're moving forward 1990s

861
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,880
we see that this process is both

862
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,520
extending geographically and I uh

863
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,579
intensified so a lot of countries or

864
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:20,099
quite a few countries in Europe have now

865
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,320
an urbanization rate apparently between

866
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,740
80 and 100 percent which is kind of the

867
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,560
ratio between population that lives in

868
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,619
cities on the total population so

869
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:34,920
between 80 and 100 of people live in

870
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,099
cities according to these definitions

871
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:40,859
again note Australia uh it's a

872
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:45,000
tremendously urbanized uh continent if

873
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,460
you will obviously this is a projection

874
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,220
of the ratio on the entire territory

875
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,180
okay so uh almost all Australians live

876
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,119
in cities but that doesn't mean that the

877
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,540
entirety of Australia is a city okay

878
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,020
Maps could lie to some extent okay so we

879
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,900
may be exaggerating some things when we

880
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,760
think about uh

881
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,500
I don't know the use of Natural

882
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,040
Resources or environmental impact uh

883
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,300
that's that's something that we could

884
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,520
think about

885
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,560
um what is also important is kind of a

886
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,079
different kind of figure is that there's

887
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,880
some kind of a decoupling between

888
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,680
processes of

889
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,500
one of a better word uh economic growth

890
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,020
or what some people call uh more

891
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,119
problematically development

892
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,140
and urbanization when you go back to say

893
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,300
the history of urbanization in the 19th

894
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,540
century it was a pro a process that was

895
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,079
intimately linked to industrialization

896
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,480
economic growth but also obviously as we

897
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,900
know uneven development within Western

898
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,400
European cities

899
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,560
there was a lot of economic development

900
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,160
in the UK cities like Manchester uh

901
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,140
because there was a boom of the textile

902
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,380
industry it led to economic growth but

903
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,240
it also led to huge uh Urban

904
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,000
inequalities but in any case at the

905
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,339
aggregate level you could say at the

906
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:13,020
level of the country or the city there

907
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,380
was an economic Improvement

908
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,000
and that connected to the growth of

909
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,320
these cities

910
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,380
what you find in you could say the last

911
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,359
20 years and this has something to do

912
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:27,020
with all kinds of neoliberal policies

913
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,119
that work at the global scale especially

914
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,760
when you talk about Asia and

915
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,400
Africa you could say

916
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,680
um uh the Strategic adjustment plans

917
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,099
that have been rolled out there by uh

918
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,140
organizations such as the international

919
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,140
monetary fund and its sister or brother

920
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,020
the World Bank which has basic basically

921
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,060
opened up the borders of these conflict

922
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,880
countries to foreign investment as this

923
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,940
would uh Kickstart growth okay

924
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,700
in reality one could argue that this has

925
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,460
produced produced a dependent form of

926
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,220
growth or you could say an exploitative

927
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,460
relation between the global periphery

928
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,119
and the global core okay but at the same

929
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,520
time has initiated and this is kind of

930
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,520
the argument by Mike Davis an implosion

931
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,700
of the countryside rural living in these

932
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,140
places

933
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,160
um became untenable because a lot of uh

934
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,140
it's a subsidized activities or

935
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,060
state-controlled activities were rolled

936
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,880
back for instance in agriculture this

937
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,619
led to huge deprivation on the

938
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:38,220
countryside and in varying degrees a

939
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,859
search to go for the battle better life

940
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,619
than in a lot of African majoriences

941
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:44,940
Okay so

942
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,819
if we thought that it could be a sign of

943
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:50,220
Economic Development we could say in the

944
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,440
19th century and even if we take up with

945
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,720
a pinch of salt that's still not

946
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,240
possible to say in uh when you talk

947
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,819
about urbanization rates for instance in

948
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:04,640
in Africa or parts of Asia okay

949
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,040
now uh so and if you look at the rates

950
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,900
of urbanization we're talking about

951
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,119
seven to eight percent in some uh

952
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,540
sub-Saharan African countries whereas if

953
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,319
you look at the older industrial areas

954
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,420
or urbanized areas it's somewhere

955
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,880
between one and two percent still growth

956
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,579
so we're doubling I would say in 36

957
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:29,700
years uh if it's two percent uh but far

958
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,980
far less

959
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,119
um

960
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,480
so yes globalized urbanization that also

961
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,180
shows when you look at the hit list of

962
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,819
largest cities

963
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:45,540
um it was very much uh euro-american if

964
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,980
you will

965
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,220
uh the industrial heart heartlands some

966
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,160
exceptions Shanghai for instance uh

967
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,500
Japan

968
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,619
1950s but then it starts to really

969
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,440
diversify and become actually a matter

970
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,560
of not Euro America but Asia Latin

971
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,720
America Etc and a number of leading

972
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,839
cities in terms of population

973
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,880
in the 1950s now well down the list to

974
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,700
take New York for instance others okay

975
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,920
so this is kind of the thesis that

976
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,680
urbanization is now a globalized

977
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,920
phenomenon there's still different kind

978
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,160
of patterns behind that just you can

979
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,020
look into this at home because it may be

980
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,920
a bit small to actually read here

981
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,119
um

982
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,880
some places when you look at Europe uh

983
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,540
we're talking about 80 urbanization

984
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,540
still in Africa despite its uh large

985
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,000
urbanization rate

986
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,740
still foremost a rural Society so even

987
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,720
this despite a kind of a global

988
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,460
transition toward globalized

989
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,440
urbanization that's quite a bit of

990
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,300
regional differences that we need to

991
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,280
take into account

992
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,859
and that brings me to the next slide

993
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:08,339
this famous image that I stole it from

994
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:12,780
Neil Brenner uh uh where Batman beats

995
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,700
the crap out of Robin because he begins

996
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,560
to talk about

997
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,619
um this urban urban age again I think

998
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:22,440
it's a moment to really uh question

999
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,140
critically what is meant by the urban

1000
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,240
agent to what extent we should really

1001
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,940
believe and go along in this Urban age

1002
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,359
frame and and a very nice paper I

1003
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,500
haven't put it in the reader because

1004
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,020
there's already quite a bit of of things

1005
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,359
in there

1006
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:40,800
is a paper by a new Brenner and

1007
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,579
Christian Smith from 2014.

1008
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:47,339
and they really deconstruct uh this

1009
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:49,400
narrative and they point to two elements

1010
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,140
one is

1011
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,920
the notion or the idea uh or the

1012
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,119
observation that we're living in the

1013
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,339
urban age could be a statistical

1014
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,760
artifact so it's a matter of how we

1015
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,740
measure things

1016
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,660
and there's actually quite a bit of

1017
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,380
Divergence over time but also across

1018
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:15,119
countries as to how a city is actually

1019
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,380
measured

1020
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,480
in some contexts

1021
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,200
um

1022
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,780
there's a city

1023
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,300
um something counts as a city as of 1

1024
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,400
000 inhabitants in other countries it

1025
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,740
would be ten thousand and it would have

1026
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,520
a tremendous impact on how we calculate

1027
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,140
the urbanization

1028
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,160
okay so this is more fundamentally uh

1029
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,680
what they argue is that there's a huge

1030
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,560
nationalist bias in how the urban is

1031
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,720
defined I'm not saying that there's 200

1032
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,839
definitions but for instance when you

1033
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,540
look at at the work the work of

1034
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,380
um

1035
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,839
of organizations like the United Nations

1036
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,839
they have been struggling to set a

1037
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,140
standard definition of what the urban is

1038
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,180
there's still quite a bit of diversity

1039
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,579
and when you look at the work of urban

1040
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:07,800
geographers for the past 50 or 60 years

1041
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,020
this is a kind of a recurring issue

1042
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,800
right so what they say is that yes there

1043
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,859
are real empirical caps in our knowledge

1044
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:21,000
here of of of the rate of urbanization

1045
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,880
uh and therefore it's almost meaningless

1046
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,680
to say as in some day in 2005 we became

1047
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,839
more urban are we by now our Urban

1048
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:33,420
species so it's kind of yes there's a

1049
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,160
broad trajectory uh toward urbanization

1050
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,339
but there's a very large bandwidth that

1051
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:45,300
that we should consider and in fact it

1052
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,740
could be more interesting to look at

1053
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,119
different kind of urbanization

1054
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,060
trajectories because it's it's dealing

1055
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,740
with all kinds of different processes

1056
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,440
that need to be studied as historically

1057
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,160
unfolding rologists then being captured

1058
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,420
in a figure of 75 for this so it's more

1059
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,460
of an invitation to start looking at

1060
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,500
things so this also connects to the

1061
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,180
second argument

1062
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,240
is that the urban as it is being

1063
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,380
measured by a process of urbanization is

1064
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,859
somewhat of a chaotic abstraction it

1065
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:21,300
means that

1066
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,079
um

1067
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,000
different kind of things that are not

1068
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,180
necessarily related are packed together

1069
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,720
to define a certain process

1070
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,700
and and this is something that for

1071
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,380
instance a new Brenner and Chris

1072
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,119
Christian Smith have also worked on

1073
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:38,460
later as they discussed the notion of

1074
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,980
planetary urbanization I invite you to

1075
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,760
look into that debate their argument is

1076
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,520
that the urban in fact as a condition as

1077
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,560
a way of life or as a system of

1078
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,660
production or exploitation does not

1079
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,500
neatly overlay actual morphologies of

1080
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,579
cities

1081
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:00,780
so the urban uh may have nothing to do

1082
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:05,579
with a concentrated uh blob of people in

1083
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,980
space or with sitting within a

1084
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,780
particular jurisdiction it could be

1085
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,680
connected to suburbs etc etc so and what

1086
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,020
they kind of are concerned with is when

1087
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,380
you talk about rates of urbanization is

1088
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,319
that you classify or categorize quite

1089
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,099
diverse uh ways of of living into one

1090
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,940
category of the urban uh and an even

1091
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,940
more problematic so hence we don't

1092
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,460
really learn anything about it and what

1093
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,500
is even more problematic is that the

1094
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,440
rule is defined as the non-urban

1095
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,780
and is thereby

1096
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,599
yeah not studied at all as kind of a

1097
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,599
left behind place that only exists in

1098
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,520
opposition to what really counts which

1099
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,800
is then the way forward which is urban

1100
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,859
living so that's kind of their arguments

1101
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:58,500
just to kick start a little bit you're

1102
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,260
thinking uh on this

1103
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,559
since we now have uh I would say 60

1104
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,319
seconds for a one minute paper Okay so

1105
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,599
please think a little bit you can talk

1106
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,819
to your neighbor

1107
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:15,119
um in any direction about what the urban

1108
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,660
is what a city is and what the

1109
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,700
differences between the two right

1110
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,579
thank you

1111
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,589
[Music]

1112
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,389
[Music]

1113
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:17,900
[Music]

1114
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,800
thank you

1115
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,220
very much

1116
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,889
[Music]

1117
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,500
those were 120 seconds

1118
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,280
right here

1119
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,079
okay

1120
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,599
[Applause]

1121
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,819
for almost three minutes for the one

1122
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,339
week paper

1123
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:21,780
please

1124
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,000
what is a city what's the urban and

1125
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,480
what's the difference

1126
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,540
okay

1127
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,180
so what's the difference then what do

1128
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,500
you say

1129
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,079
why is the urban a place

1130
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,059
oh maybe not

1131
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:53,339
because there are quite density of many

1132
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:57,079
layers and cities

1133
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,480
okay and why do you think it's the

1134
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,240
reverse I think elements of the oven can

1135
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,520
exist everywhere I don't think elements

1136
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,040
of the city exist everyone so the city

1137
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,920
defined as a dense place is kind of

1138
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,740
identifiable in space whereas the urban

1139
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,260
could yeah connect to everywhere

1140
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,559
potentially okay

1141
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:22,339
other ideas

1142
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,700
or inequality or like in an infield

1143
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,319
environment this is something you can

1144
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,559
touch

1145
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,819
so one is about you could say concrete

1146
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:49,099
lumps of material yeah

1147
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,460
about Urban societies yeah

1148
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,240
other ideas yeah

1149
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,119
yeah I think that connects a little bit

1150
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:09,000
to what what we say processes and then

1151
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,460
maybe outcomes products of urbanization

1152
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,200
okay now other ideas

1153
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,800
Etc

1154
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,420
and that wouldn't be captured by the

1155
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,000
notion of a city

1156
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,960
if not cities can be

1157
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,500
places of extreme exclusivity okay

1158
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,280
um of dedicated to a very specific class

1159
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,380
so a lot not all cities have

1160
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,740
same the Notions of having public

1161
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,480
transport that is Affordable for

1162
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,400
everyone but I would say that if you're

1163
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,859
talking about the urban you're already

1164
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,079
thinking of it in terms of how do we

1165
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,599
organize this mass group of people okay

1166
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,079
and how do we get order into

1167
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:10,800
um

1168
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,079
so it's about the club projects

1169
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,660
particular values perhaps behind

1170
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,420
policies to organize cities we are

1171
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,280
building on the process idea that was

1172
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,839
mentioned earlier

1173
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:22,920
okay

1174
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,460
any other ideas still

1175
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,460
yeah I think maybe for a city I think of

1176
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,380
it having

1177
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,280
focus of like

1178
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:38,099
being people and maybe that also nothing

1179
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,319
on to sort of like a governance

1180
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,839
structure versus for urban I maybe think

1181
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,220
more about

1182
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,059
what is the like level of density and

1183
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:51,859
the living situation and people okay

1184
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:56,880
okay or like a descriptor versus like a

1185
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,720
um

1186
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,260
thing that everybody is like linked to

1187
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,420
or participating in yeah yeah yeah okay

1188
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,940
yeah there was a hand still behind

1189
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,400
somewhere yeah at the back

1190
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
um

1191
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,999
[Music]

1192
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:25,880
[Music]

1193
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,819
yeah so it's an administrative unit

1194
00:57:28,819 --> 00:57:32,579
which elected officials Etc that

1195
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:34,859
accounts within the boundaries of a

1196
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:36,180
certain space and not beyond that

1197
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,800
perhaps

1198
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,099
all right so inductively you make my

1199
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:43,200
made my next slide's completely

1200
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,980
redundant uh so yeah one of the ideas

1201
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,680
and importantly to say I mean with

1202
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,240
Brandon Schmidt it's kind of a

1203
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,059
sensitivity that the urban and cities

1204
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:56,280
are not necessarily the same

1205
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,839
I think

1206
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,880
the point is not to say or to Define

1207
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,319
clearly what

1208
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:04,260
a city is or the urban is but you offer

1209
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,380
different kind of perspectives

1210
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,420
um different kind of lenses

1211
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,260
on on the question and by offering

1212
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,720
different kind of perspectives

1213
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,520
are emerging from different kind of

1214
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,500
questions we may actually learn more

1215
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,140
about the process of urbanization so it

1216
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:25,020
is not kind of one ruling explanation

1217
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,420
but there's many ways of looking at it

1218
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,640
okay

1219
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,980
um but I think yeah we'll get to

1220
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,339
something more so one idea is that it's

1221
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:36,240
about

1222
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,180
a concentration of people it's also also

1223
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,700
about the concentration of stuff

1224
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,700
lump of material the built environment

1225
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,380
yeah so it's something with density

1226
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,480
something also a lot of I think

1227
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,940
urbanists would recognize so it's the

1228
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,880
built environment built up space that

1229
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,880
clearly gives morphological uh signs

1230
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,579
that at some point we have arrived in

1231
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:02,900
the city be it high rises

1232
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,839
a lot of of congestion uh that would be

1233
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:10,440
markers of characteristics of so that's

1234
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,380
kind of not necessarily Urban but it's a

1235
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,760
kind of a marker of what is a city

1236
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,760
then fetching a little bit more into

1237
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,799
you could say the overlays between what

1238
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:23,760
is urban

1239
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,400
and how it's the borders cities

1240
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,579
um cities are sometimes defined as uh

1241
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:34,440
the opposite of the non-city as I was

1242
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,260
saying uh as the opposite of the rural

1243
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,780
and then a number of planning contexts

1244
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,240
I'm thinking about for instance the

1245
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,579
Netherlands it will actually be if you

1246
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:46,380
look at the satellite image it will be

1247
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,400
identifiable where one urban area ends

1248
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,680
then there's Countryside and then

1249
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,780
something else starts

1250
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,980
but

1251
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,280
yeah in many contexts especially in the

1252
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,380
Flemish one for instance this is a

1253
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,240
reality where you won't get really far

1254
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,180
it's kind of you're not sure where the

1255
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,579
where the city ends you you end up with

1256
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:10,520
some kind of um

1257
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,579
large boulevards that connect to yeah

1258
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:16,980
villages in in the middle of nowhere

1259
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,400
there's a lot of built up uh stuff along

1260
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,579
these uh schustees Etc

1261
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,380
um and there's a lot of activities

1262
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,839
actually taking place outside of the

1263
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,119
core areas of urban agglomerations

1264
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:33,000
there's suburbs uh there's actually an

1265
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,660
intensification of activities in suburbs

1266
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,680
um

1267
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,119
so yeah

1268
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,940
um what does it still mean to talk about

1269
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:44,220
the city as being opposed to the

1270
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,099
non-city the rural it generates all

1271
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:49,760
kinds of fuzzy categories so purely

1272
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,579
morphologically you may end up

1273
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:58,099
um being in trouble now okay yes

1274
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:01,449
[Music]

1275
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,380
that's for me

1276
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,040
the city is something that is

1277
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,780
that's perpetually becoming something

1278
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,780
um

1279
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,200
energy where we can experiment with our

1280
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,440
identities and

1281
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,740
yeah yeah I agree uh we haven't covered

1282
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,660
this yet so maybe we're we're talking

1283
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,599
about about this so it's

1284
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,079
yeah the urban or a city uh is the place

1285
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:34,079
of an urban life but perhaps the urban

1286
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,260
also selections Beyond uh the city

1287
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,440
itself so Urban living could also be

1288
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,900
taking place in the suburbs but it's

1289
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,900
some kind of an idea that within

1290
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:46,680
um

1291
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,920
Within These spaces uh a different kind

1292
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,599
of society and a different kind of

1293
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,460
behavior uh Norms values can take place

1294
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,920
um so it's a distinctive way of life but

1295
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,200
still it could be

1296
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,020
um a very different kind of energy that

1297
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,700
we may be talking about or a different

1298
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,760
kind of bones that actually uh ties

1299
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,859
people together

1300
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:13,920
so just compare slum living with Loft

1301
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,420
living it's a very distinct way of urban

1302
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:21,240
living but they've been Mo both be

1303
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,980
characterized as something else than

1304
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,859
ruralism okay so

1305
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:27,299
um and there's this big debate I would

1306
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:30,420
say in urban sociology between what is

1307
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,079
now distinct about the urban way of life

1308
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,240
as some kind of an assumption that you

1309
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,599
move from Community uh to society and

1310
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,099
communities think about rural

1311
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:43,079
communities where you have all kinds of

1312
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:46,079
uh personal relations with neighbors

1313
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,299
it's a small villages and this gets

1314
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:53,940
formalized anonymized as soon as you get

1315
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,040
to cities because distances become

1316
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,119
larger because there's all kinds of

1317
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,619
institutional roles there's a division

1318
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:03,319
of labor that we'll get to in a second

1319
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:07,020
and it becomes more abstract you take a

1320
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,299
certain function within society which is

1321
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:12,420
less mediated my social relations that

1322
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,900
was kind of the argument uh by a lot of

1323
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,220
sociologists also in the 19th century

1324
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,500
that tried to capture the process of

1325
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,540
urbanization so it's a distinctive way

1326
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,819
of life it's not just buildings and

1327
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:27,599
humps and of material it's it's it's

1328
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,520
more than that

1329
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,260
another way of looking at it and with

1330
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,839
internet uh by you here at front it's

1331
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,720
also about economic relations that tie

1332
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,020
together people um think about flows of

1333
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,700
energy flows of of work flows of ideas

1334
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,559
uh flows of data

1335
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,140
um that's uh that connects the

1336
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,180
inhabitants of a certain place and it

1337
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,599
would be more uh agglomerated in some

1338
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:57,240
places than others but they wouldn't be

1339
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,000
necessarily confined to you could say

1340
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,280
the core of metropolitan areas

1341
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,799
so the city is also the place where

1342
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,440
divisions of labor emerge and there's

1343
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,960
this famous picture by Adam Smith's

1344
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,099
needle Factory or pin Factory uh where

1345
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:17,700
uh cities are kind of a microcosm of an

1346
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,700
uh a workshop where different kind of

1347
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,579
tasks that used to be integrated in uh

1348
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:27,000
in pin making are kind of cut up and

1349
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,720
collectively places uh produce a certain

1350
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,839
economic product okay so there's inputs

1351
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,760
needed by different kind of suppliers

1352
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,660
different kind of specialized workers do

1353
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:43,520
end up with a product okay so

1354
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,440
historically that has been a way where

1355
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,920
Urban Elites could emerge that could

1356
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,500
also kind of manage this process that

1357
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,319
could also absorb part of the Surplus

1358
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:58,079
that was being generated by a more

1359
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,260
efficient uh efficient division of labor

1360
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,960
standardization of work for instance and

1361
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,220
it was also you could say in a more

1362
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,799
critical framework the place where

1363
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:10,020
uneven development and urban

1364
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,420
inequalities actually have their Origins

1365
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,180
okay so it produced more efficiency it

1366
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,760
increased the urban Surplus if you will

1367
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,660
but not everybody benefited so a complex

1368
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,780
division of labor the idea that there

1369
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:28,140
are a collaboration Effects by being in

1370
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,640
a certain place

1371
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,920
economic agents for instance will

1372
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,200
benefit from from their presence because

1373
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,420
they have specialized inputs Etc that's

1374
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,819
kind of the realm of urban economics

1375
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:41,940
Urban economic geographies that try to

1376
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,099
capture that process

1377
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:45,900
enough is obviously when you talk about

1378
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,420
uh divisions of labor about these

1379
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,180
energies that go around these also

1380
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,920
structure

1381
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,559
um Urban spaces and you could say Urban

1382
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:58,200
class relations in a particular way

1383
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,640
so

1384
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,740
you could apply some kind of a

1385
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,859
regulationist perspective here thinking

1386
01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:06,180
about

1387
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:06,839
um

1388
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:10,799
we could say different eras of uh of of

1389
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:11,819
cities

1390
01:06:11,819 --> 01:06:14,520
as being engaged in particular

1391
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,040
production processes pre-capitalist

1392
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,520
cities for instance at the top left then

1393
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,940
the typical newly industrializing cities

1394
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:27,200
uh top right then going bottom left to

1395
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,299
for the cities and then you could say

1396
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:32,640
contemporary cities that are kind of

1397
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,940
both exploded and imploded at the same

1398
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,819
time with Rising densities at the edges

1399
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:41,339
and also a re-intensification of build

1400
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:43,260
up areas in the in the very core and the

1401
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,660
return of activities there so a regular

1402
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,180
a regular regulations perspective is

1403
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,940
also kind of what Dory Massey will be

1404
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,700
talking about she was a famous economic

1405
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,220
geographers economic geographer from

1406
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,799
1980s and she was also one of the main

1407
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,500
critical voices and trying to understand

1408
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,039
how particular forms of capitalism leave

1409
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,640
their imprint on society in general and

1410
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,559
on Urban Societies in particular she was

1411
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,020
interested in regions but it also can be

1412
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,160
applied

1413
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,359
um to cities so yeah you had a really uh

1414
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:21,480
a very hierarchical Society in general I

1415
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,039
mean there's a huge generalization here

1416
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,039
in medieval cities where the core was an

1417
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:28,799
elite realm uh with some domestic

1418
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,839
servants then there was a kind of a

1419
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:32,579
layer of the lower classes and then

1420
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:34,380
basically the outcasts with the number

1421
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,660
of ethnic communities this I mean

1422
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,940
there's a huge generalization but it's

1423
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,420
kind of a guiding model uh that is it's

1424
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,960
it's set to hold when you think about

1425
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,579
industrializing cities it was kind of

1426
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:50,220
thing and this is uh Chicago for sure

1427
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:52,920
and we'll be talking with Nick more

1428
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,799
about Chicago as it became a model of of

1429
01:07:55,799 --> 01:07:58,079
the industrial city in the early 20th

1430
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,839
century uh a lot of industrial activity

1431
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:03,000
in the commercial

1432
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,480
um Heart of the City and then radiating

1433
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,020
out uh in terms of you could say classes

1434
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,900
working men's houses and then further on

1435
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,679
more Elite cities people neighborhoods

1436
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:18,000
people that could actually afford to

1437
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,238
commute to the city center

1438
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:24,420
then after the second world war if you

1439
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,399
look at the bottom left it's a kind of

1440
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,920
the poorest city where capitalism was

1441
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,560
regulated in a particular way where the

1442
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,679
Surplus that was being created by

1443
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:36,719
capitalist production think about all

1444
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,540
these factories mass production was

1445
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,580
being shared by the working class so

1446
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,080
this is kind of the typical American

1447
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:46,020
dream it typifies American cities but it

1448
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,299
depends also to provide European cities

1449
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:50,299
where we had a massive round of

1450
01:08:50,299 --> 01:08:54,060
suburbanization uh the good life where

1451
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:57,120
you could live far removed from

1452
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,920
um from where you worked

1453
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,880
compute by car and it was a way to kind

1454
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,279
of spatially redistribute the surface

1455
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,439
that was being generated in cities okay

1456
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,960
that's a kind of a Harvard David

1457
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,359
harveying interpretation of

1458
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:14,939
suburbanization is not just a lifestyle

1459
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:17,339
it's also a spatial form of how

1460
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:21,179
capitalism uh of in that period worked

1461
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:22,198
okay

1462
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:24,719
and then kind of finally

1463
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,719
um this kind of growth at the periphery

1464
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:30,899
we see a kind of an outward movement you

1465
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:33,540
can say the urbanization of Suburbia all

1466
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,698
kinds of knowledge identity activities

1467
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:38,819
that are starting to take place at the

1468
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:42,238
edges a lot of City centers that are

1469
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:45,060
losing functions this kind of historical

1470
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,100
process in the 70s and 80s a lot of

1471
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,219
derelict areas Brownfield areas which

1472
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,500
are then in the subsequent decades

1473
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,600
increasingly becoming the places where

1474
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,360
you have waves of gentrification a

1475
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,600
return of capital uh to City centers etc

1476
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,719
etc

1477
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,580
all this and I'm trying to hugely

1478
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,860
summarize and generalize here because

1479
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:12,000
it's a kind of Ideal typical approach

1480
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
um diversity that is increasing in a lot

1481
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,300
of cities new pockets of exclusiveness

1482
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,420
and exclusion on the other hand so

1483
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,400
cities also becoming increasingly

1484
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:28,020
polarized Etc so the urban is is

1485
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,679
different depending on the period you're

1486
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,600
talking about it could be characterized

1487
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,600
differently depending on where you are

1488
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,760
and in what period you're talking about

1489
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,800
[Music]

1490
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,420
bottom left and right

1491
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,940
yeah you could say that I mean

1492
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,400
um in some handbooks it would be called

1493
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,820
the Ford City this one and this would be

1494
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,600
the post for this city which is kind of

1495
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,760
exopolis there's not one and

1496
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,699
identifiable Horror in the metropolitan

1497
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:07,500
area

1498
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,320
um whereas this was still very much in

1499
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,239
relation before but it captures the

1500
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,540
difference you could call it modernity

1501
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:18,659
um yes but that's more referred to you

1502
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:21,739
could say a discussion of planning

1503
01:11:21,739 --> 01:11:25,320
approaches uh modernist planning for

1504
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,120
instance where it was okay we're going

1505
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,659
to organize the city in zones here is

1506
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:32,699
residential function here we have

1507
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:35,280
industrial function but but you're right

1508
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,199
in that sense especially in the Forest

1509
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,159
City it was uh at the larger scale

1510
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,980
managed like that and it was also where

1511
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,460
a lot of urbanists come to reaction uh

1512
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:51,060
was launched against uh later on

1513
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,020
um

1514
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,199
think about the figure of Jane Jacobs

1515
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:57,300
who basically said well with Mother's

1516
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,580
Fleming this hand there's a top-down

1517
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,560
approach doesn't have anything to do

1518
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,320
with with urban life in us and of its

1519
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,360
own so we have to take stock of that to

1520
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,860
start thinking about a different way of

1521
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,060
planning so

1522
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,400
modernism would be a marker I would say

1523
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,520
of uh again yeah of urban Society but

1524
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,980
also about planning Traditions uh that

1525
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:20,600
have produced before this city

1526
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:23,460
and then another way and this wasn't

1527
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:27,300
really mentioned is yeah the urban or

1528
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,880
the city is also kind of a projector of

1529
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,920
symbolic power

1530
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,699
um

1531
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:36,600
it sends a message to the world and this

1532
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,020
is becoming uh I mean goes back to the

1533
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,380
20 the 12th and the 13th century where

1534
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:46,860
uh the evil cities and Flanders had the

1535
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,260
highest wanted to have the highest

1536
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:52,500
building or some jiminiano in the 14th

1537
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,540
century and Northern Italy

1538
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,380
um

1539
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,980
had something to do with corporate power

1540
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,840
Merchant power but also showing the

1541
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,900
Liberties of cities vis-a-vis uh

1542
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,000
territorial states which were then still

1543
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,760
feudal states in the Middle Ages

1544
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,620
you see that this is becoming much more

1545
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,199
globalized and that's the content of

1546
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,719
these messages is also very diverse you

1547
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:18,960
have the CCTV building in Beijing which

1548
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,300
is some kind of a representation of if

1549
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,880
it's authoritarian power of the Chinese

1550
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,699
Central State over China but also extra

1551
01:13:29,699 --> 01:13:32,340
territorially as the World Trade Center

1552
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,960
and

1553
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,940
yeah we I don't think we need to

1554
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,280
deconstruct that and I mean there's a

1555
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,199
lot of images

1556
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:40,980
um

1557
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:43,800
I mean about acclaimed imperialism by

1558
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,440
the US which was fasted in the

1559
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,719
commercial uh interests or the

1560
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,880
commercial power of the superpower of

1561
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,500
the US

1562
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,100
um which then also became uh a symbol of

1563
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,980
uh of Oppression if you will and made it

1564
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:03,060
a a target for uh for attacks

1565
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:06,900
um as we all know so it's it's a highly

1566
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:11,880
contested uh or arbitrary symbol there

1567
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,199
and often it's also kind of used in

1568
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,820
speculative

1569
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:20,699
developments you could say uh Khalifa in

1570
01:14:20,699 --> 01:14:23,400
the Middle East and Dubai

1571
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,920
um it's kind of part of a wider process

1572
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,480
of say

1573
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,960
ing Supply sites economics where it's

1574
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,560
really about building capacity building

1575
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,420
state-of-the-art infrastructure with the

1576
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,640
idea that it will attract business and

1577
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,219
others will in the end

1578
01:14:40,219 --> 01:14:44,100
drive drive growth to buy an Emirates

1579
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:47,460
without oil or where oil has run out

1580
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:49,820
through the 60s has had this

1581
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:52,739
diversification strategy and it has been

1582
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:55,140
to some extent a kind of self-fulfilling

1583
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:59,040
prophecy uh so yeah it's kind of a token

1584
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,860
of importance of centrality that is

1585
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,920
being proclaimed there it also is a

1586
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,020
token of other things a huge

1587
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,600
exploitation of temporary labor for

1588
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,000
instance but it is typically the Dark

1589
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,520
Side of these kind of uh buildings that

1590
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,460
is less uh discussed so it's part of

1591
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,800
spectacular urbanism makes us wonder

1592
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,880
what what is behind uh this image so

1593
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,340
yeah symbolic power has also kind of

1594
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:31,340
projected uh by certain kind of cities

1595
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,140
um and then maybe a final definition is

1596
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:36,060
indeed yeah the administrative

1597
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,659
definition

1598
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:41,520
um it has is a certain yeah

1599
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,340
um jurisdiction within a country it's

1600
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,500
the way where all kinds of management

1601
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,780
processes are administered but the

1602
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,880
population is serviced but how the

1603
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,460
public sector organizes itself and what

1604
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,020
is kind of interesting is that there's a

1605
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,520
lot of kind of

1606
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,880
um historical and accuracy

1607
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,840
um yeah aberrations almost uh when you

1608
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,820
take for instance the example of of

1609
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,640
medicine uh in West Flanders I put an

1610
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,340
arrow there for those who don't know uh

1611
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:14,580
Belgium that well it has about 1 000

1612
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:17,880
population in 2019 but it counts as a

1613
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,860
city yeah so it's kind of a historical

1614
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,080
artifact

1615
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:22,739
um

1616
01:16:22,739 --> 01:16:25,860
it used to be a very important

1617
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,320
um trading center for broadcloth if

1618
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,540
you've ever been to Bruges that was was

1619
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,699
kind of the main

1620
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:34,679
um main kind of produce that was kind of

1621
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:38,699
uh traded there Bridges was 40 000 k at

1622
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:40,620
that time so a fifth of the size of

1623
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,860
world City bridges in I think the 13th

1624
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,260
century so what is a very small

1625
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,480
community now was there there and then

1626
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,719
an important city and somehow Mason has

1627
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:54,480
kept its City rights and would still

1628
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,380
count as a city in un uh in U.N language

1629
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,739
okay so just to show that we should

1630
01:17:01,739 --> 01:17:04,460
probably be very wary about

1631
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,380
about these classifications because they

1632
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:12,440
can be uh quite misleading okay

1633
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:21,120
for the number of people living there or

1634
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,500
um that's a good question I didn't know

1635
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,880
it by heart that it would be a

1636
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,280
combination of of

1637
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,560
of many things it would be indeed uh

1638
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,980
size of the population I think

1639
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:35,100
um yeah more more morphological

1640
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,620
um character characteristics typically

1641
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,360
it would be

1642
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:39,980
um

1643
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:42,719
continuous built up areas

1644
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,159
uh

1645
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,900
um and then included in that

1646
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,760
some definition of a percentage of

1647
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,580
people commuting to the poor City so

1648
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:56,760
areas that are still dependent uh on the

1649
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,679
core City because they're part of an

1650
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:01,500
integrated labor market so I don't know

1651
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,659
it by heart but there's kind of the the

1652
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:05,520
agglomeration and then the bond here

1653
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,500
which is gives a kind of an another

1654
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:12,120
territory of that so and then

1655
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,620
um that's basically what they call

1656
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:16,199
functional urban areas that the kind of

1657
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:19,739
definition that is that people would use

1658
01:18:19,739 --> 01:18:22,260
yeah and I think maybe there's also

1659
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,719
something app to the part in becoming

1660
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:25,920
school because I know what they're made

1661
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,440
for example my appointment is my city it

1662
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,420
never got similar rights okay so maybe

1663
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,940
they just never requested anyways and

1664
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,820
maybe they didn't did they did Wells

1665
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:38,100
back in yeah

1666
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,500
yeah I think that that could indeed I I

1667
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,300
don't know the ins and outs of that but

1668
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,159
I think indeed that could be a to be

1669
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,520
part of the process as well yeah

1670
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,639
[Music]

1671
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:56,520
yeah they try to come up with some kind

1672
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,620
of a standardization on the criteria

1673
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:01,199
that I was mentioning so it's a yeah how

1674
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,239
many people live there

1675
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,520
morphological continuity and then you

1676
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,040
could say economic relations

1677
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,560
but especially when the um with the

1678
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,900
population threshold there's a huge

1679
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,960
fabrication some countries it would be 1

1680
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:20,600
000 and others it would be ten thousands

1681
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,080
um I think they do because Belgium does

1682
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,020
so um so that's kind of the irony yeah

1683
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:31,260
and that gets lost in when you look at

1684
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,120
the urbanization rates of 200 plus

1685
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,719
countries you can't look into that but

1686
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,880
the point by by Brendan Schmidt is that

1687
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,980
even if you solve that and come to a

1688
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,199
standardized definition you're still not

1689
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,239
out of the woods because it's it could

1690
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,159
still

1691
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:49,440
create all kinds of chaotic uh

1692
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,659
conceptions because the urban is not the

1693
01:19:51,659 --> 01:19:54,600
same as the city okay so that was kind

1694
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,600
of uh was the point okay so I hope yeah

1695
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,840
there's a number of perspectives here

1696
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:01,560
um

1697
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,040
there's not one size fits all answer to

1698
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,020
what the urban and the city is but

1699
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:09,540
there's different ways of of approaching

1700
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:12,679
the theme okay

1701
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,360
now

1702
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,860
um

1703
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:19,260
one definition that we could still use

1704
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,659
and there's also one that is used in the

1705
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:24,659
handbook is kind of very generically at

1706
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:26,580
the abstract level it's obviously

1707
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:28,800
urbanization is the process of becoming

1708
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,060
Urban

1709
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,640
and it refers at the abstract level to

1710
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,739
demographic process where increasingly

1711
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:35,659
people

1712
01:20:35,659 --> 01:20:38,159
live in that and more more and more

1713
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:39,179
density

1714
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:40,620
it has something to do with the

1715
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:43,860
globalization of uh

1716
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:47,100
uh of urban uh influence be it economic

1717
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,100
political cultural yeah it's kind of

1718
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,900
these places that matter

1719
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,900
and obviously this this Frame of the

1720
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:58,140
urban age is mobilized there

1721
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,300
and it's a call for

1722
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,360
starting to look into how cities are

1723
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,300
connected to the wider process of Urban

1724
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,920
Development

1725
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,320
and this is also connecting back to this

1726
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,260
notion of planetary urbanization

1727
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:16,560
by Brenner and Schmidt in a sense what

1728
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,940
they argue is that while cities may not

1729
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:23,880
populate the entire Earth they're

1730
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,719
actually

1731
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:27,900
quite delineated still if you produce a

1732
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:28,739
map

1733
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:31,980
you can't say that the entire uh global

1734
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,860
map is urban uh maybe a lot of people

1735
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:36,780
live in cities but still it wouldn't be

1736
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:38,540
a totality

1737
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:43,500
whereas the urban as a process as a way

1738
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,659
of living as a system of capitalist

1739
01:21:45,659 --> 01:21:49,140
production would be almost a totality

1740
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:52,380
and in planetary urbanization captures

1741
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:55,260
actually the fact that even when you go

1742
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,840
as far as as possible from the urban

1743
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,719
context from cities

1744
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,360
it would still lead back to these cities

1745
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,400
one way or another so the exploitation

1746
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,179
of seabeds in the North Atlantic it's

1747
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:12,480
absolutely absolutely not uh has not the

1748
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,300
characteristics of cities but it's

1749
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,500
part of a uh of exploitation processes

1750
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,320
that are commanded through uh through

1751
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,719
cities so it's a an example of what they

1752
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,380
call extensive urbanization whereas

1753
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,600
intensive urbanization in their mind

1754
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,179
would be the morphology of cities so

1755
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:36,440
it's a kind of sociological imaginary of

1756
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,780
urbanization As It All Leads back to

1757
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:42,600
cities one way or another whereas a more

1758
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,239
geographical imagination would start

1759
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:47,280
with well we can still remunerate

1760
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,400
certain places as being more dense as

1761
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,100
being more urban than one another

1762
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,179
whereas we also have to see the

1763
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:56,640
connections with other things so

1764
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,280
that's just one more approach of looking

1765
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,440
at it

1766
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,820
we've been talking a little bit about

1767
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,800
urbanism because it's always a bit of

1768
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,060
confusion difference between

1769
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,980
urbanization which we've been talking

1770
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,380
about and urbanism

1771
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:13,320
um you have urbanists here it's it's not

1772
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,840
just about observing and analyzing

1773
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,940
breasts is also

1774
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:21,360
um designing cities and shaping cities

1775
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,460
in a particular way so urbanism is

1776
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:31,080
is uh Dimitri uh uh as the craft of

1777
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,480
actually designing cities to a certain

1778
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,900
end but it also connects to uh and

1779
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,159
that's perhaps also what you were

1780
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,260
talking about at some point gaining an

1781
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,120
urban attitude there's something of an

1782
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,760
energy of that particular society and

1783
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,239
cities refers to a particular

1784
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:51,600
psychological or sociological feeling uh

1785
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,640
that gives a particular meaning to a

1786
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,860
space and I already talked about the

1787
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:58,860
opposition between the ideal type of a

1788
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:02,280
community where this kind of warm social

1789
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,980
ties kicking things together versus a

1790
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,199
society where it's more abstract formal

1791
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:10,800
roles that are impersonal uh I think

1792
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,960
when you look at cities and the

1793
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,480
representations and the way the urban

1794
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,719
space is consumed you find a lot of that

1795
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,140
uh you could say societal

1796
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:25,860
um anonymity uh or that kind of detached

1797
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,100
element in those images and

1798
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,800
when you look at yeah especially in the

1799
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,360
19th century

1800
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,159
I mean when people start to capture

1801
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:38,699
process of modernity of urban modernity

1802
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,860
and with this idea of the figure of the

1803
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:43,380
fla nerve which was at the same time it

1804
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:46,620
was usually a he a Dandy a rich person

1805
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:49,020
that was both connected to cities

1806
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,000
because of his wealth and he had to show

1807
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,980
himself off but at the same time he was

1808
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:57,360
also a spectator a walker by Passion who

1809
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,400
consumed Urban space from in a very

1810
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,920
Anonymous and detached way and

1811
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,020
especially in the 19th century I mean we

1812
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,699
have this Gallery here close to the

1813
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:06,980
ground Plus

1814
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:10,380
in Brussels it was a kind of urban space

1815
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,600
was designed for this Anonymous

1816
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,780
consumption was was all about Collective

1817
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:18,780
spectacular consumption and in many ways

1818
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,280
Urban Design

1819
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:23,340
especially when we start to Rebrand our

1820
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:24,960
city centers

1821
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,960
goes back to these forms of of urban

1822
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,060
consumption if you think about these

1823
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:34,800
renderings of uh on Spock Boulevard or

1824
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,260
if you look at renderings of how uh

1825
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:39,360
Philippine campus will look like in 10

1826
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,880
years it has this kind of spectacular

1827
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,640
element always to it that's that

1828
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,100
protects a particular kind of urban

1829
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,880
attitude that is there to consume Urban

1830
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,219
space to work

1831
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:56,880
so Urban Design it's about

1832
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:57,780
um

1833
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:00,600
they're really giving shape to Urban

1834
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,239
spaces but also capturing how people

1835
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:06,239
interact with psychologically and

1836
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,860
sociologically with the built

1837
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:11,000
environment especially within urbanism

1838
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,260
for for instance environmental

1839
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,960
psychology and that is a a very

1840
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,219
important team

1841
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,219
planning is

1842
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:25,620
a future oriented activity in which acts

1843
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,300
as various types engaged so that they

1844
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,400
can govern how development will take

1845
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,380
place so

1846
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,380
um obviously

1847
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,239
economic process societal process don't

1848
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,880
just unfold in and of themselves it's a

1849
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,520
kind of uh process of being mediated by

1850
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,280
a particular planning cultures I mean we

1851
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,980
talked about zoning before it's about

1852
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:49,760
giving a place to certain activities

1853
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,100
making choices of where things should be

1854
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,080
developed and it's actually quite a

1855
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,900
power Laden process because development

1856
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,239
in one place could mean non-development

1857
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:03,120
in another place where do jobs where are

1858
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,120
jobs being creative where do they not

1859
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,520
and how do certain planning procedures

1860
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,420
start to to tackle uh process of uneven

1861
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,340
development or under development within

1862
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,199
the city and especially in a city like

1863
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:18,239
Brussels

1864
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:21,120
one of the main you could say folki off

1865
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,280
of urban planning

1866
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,100
um in the regional plan has been the

1867
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:29,600
Canal Zone it was kind of a prioritary

1868
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,420
space which needed to be redeveloped in

1869
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,360
one way it's a well we'll be looking

1870
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,659
into the social geography of this place

1871
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:41,460
uh and and throughout the course but

1872
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,920
also as we go on excursions it's an

1873
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,020
ethnically diverse typically lower

1874
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:47,940
income neighborhood with a lot of

1875
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:51,360
unemployment and it's also very much a

1876
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,100
zone of transitions a lot of things

1877
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,199
happening there Redevelopment and

1878
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:58,080
planning is not neutral there

1879
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,940
um there has been a large focus on this

1880
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:03,860
area both in terms of trying to achieve

1881
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:06,420
industrial Redevelopment because there

1882
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:09,480
was a lot of unemployment kind of a

1883
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:12,300
rollout of a zone of economic expansion

1884
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,639
that was installed there

1885
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,639
at the same time also the ambition to

1886
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:22,080
achieve mixity to increase the mixing of

1887
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,480
residential and and

1888
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,139
um and and workings okay

1889
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:30,960
and what is kind of interesting there in

1890
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,540
in Brussels is that there was a very big

1891
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:36,300
contradiction between the ambition to

1892
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,300
attract uh businesses to this area and

1893
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,940
create jobs and the ambition of mixer

1894
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:44,580
team because mix City worked as a kind

1895
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,920
of an incentive for all of residential

1896
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:50,340
developers to start building

1897
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:53,340
um yeah high-end or

1898
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:57,060
I would say regionally unaffordable uh

1899
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:00,780
Apartments house etc etc so

1900
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:04,620
the idea of let's mix stuff is actually

1901
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,480
making

1902
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,120
um The Return of jobs to this area

1903
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,580
very difficult it leads to forms of

1904
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,300
industrial gentrification

1905
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:17,639
and it's also leading to some kind of an

1906
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:20,040
affordability crisis because the types

1907
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,659
of houses that are being produced there

1908
01:29:21,659 --> 01:29:24,659
has nothing to do with what the local

1909
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:27,679
residents would actually need okay so

1910
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:30,360
that's housing production but it's not

1911
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,420
tailored to the demand if you will

1912
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:37,860
so yes uh planning plays a role

1913
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:43,100
um and it's all but a neutral process

1914
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,280
now what is geography

1915
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,500
you have one minute to discuss this and

1916
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,480
geographers I'm looking at you to

1917
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,739
explain what geography is

1918
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,460
because I can't

1919
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:01,400
please discuss what is geography

1920
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:07,460
foreign

1921
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:21,720
[Music]

1922
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:43,520
[Music]

1923
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:53,049
[Music]

1924
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,060
yes

1925
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:06,120
you have an idea already

1926
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,880
it's not as I have to explain not the

1927
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,580
parts or branch of geology

1928
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,620
and receptions that's typically what I'm

1929
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,620
meeting up okay but um what's your idea

1930
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,900
about this

1931
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:21,900
mm-hmm

1932
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,800
and they were

1933
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:35,280
maybe total topology or

1934
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,280
the terrains like that or the nearby

1935
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,679
services

1936
01:31:40,679 --> 01:31:41,699
so

1937
01:31:41,699 --> 01:31:44,520
where a particular location is

1938
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,620
okay so it's about location it's about

1939
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:49,440
the impact of you could say the terrain

1940
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,900
on activities and those kind of things

1941
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:56,659
oh yeah okay thank you

1942
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
um

1943
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:08,239
particular like areas on sale

1944
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:11,600
like

1945
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:16,199
geology for example okay

1946
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:19,260
geography is the study of space I mean I

1947
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,780
can be applied to anything so it doesn't

1948
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:23,219
matter what you're studying if you want

1949
01:32:23,219 --> 01:32:26,100
to be looking at a scale then that's

1950
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,400
okay

1951
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,020
that gives us tremendous power as

1952
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:34,520
geographers thank you for that

1953
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:40,400
thank you for that any other ideas yeah

1954
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:52,739
so dialectics between humans and the

1955
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:54,900
environment okay

1956
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,360
other ideas yeah

1957
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,360
foreign

1958
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,560
[Music]

1959
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:32,940
like to say for example sometimes it to

1960
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,560
faculty

1961
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,400
you think so special approach

1962
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,400
that's very interesting yeah and your

1963
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,980
idea is still

1964
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:47,760
okay I think I think there's all I would

1965
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,219
say correct in a way but it shows that

1966
01:33:50,219 --> 01:33:51,840
there's different different answers to

1967
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,300
this question and the answer to this

1968
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,100
question has been different throughout

1969
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,280
the history of geography uh I would say

1970
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,620
in the 19th century it was indeed about

1971
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:04,560
creating detailed information on

1972
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,840
resources topography and those kind of

1973
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,300
things because geography was installed

1974
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:12,420
in an imperial program of exploiting the

1975
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:17,040
colonies but throughout the decades uh

1976
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,560
the main purpose or less on depth of

1977
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,780
geography has shifted

1978
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,659
or there's different kind of parallel

1979
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,400
interpretations of what the purpose of

1980
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,139
geography should be

1981
01:34:28,139 --> 01:34:30,679
I start with a number of

1982
01:34:30,679 --> 01:34:33,600
definitions where else do we go the real

1983
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,540
Royal geographical Society this is this

1984
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:40,020
kind of the heart of Empire if you will

1985
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:41,580
um one of the first geographical

1986
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:44,460
Societies in the kind of part of the

1987
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:48,120
British Empire as it's a kind of ruled

1988
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:51,480
disease and it gives us some idea of

1989
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,540
what geography could be so it's

1990
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:56,460
the understanding of Social and physical

1991
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:58,500
processes within the context plays

1992
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,179
recognizing the great differences in

1993
01:35:00,179 --> 01:35:01,860
cultures political systems economies

1994
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:03,480
Landscapes and environments across the

1995
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,980
world and exploring things between them

1996
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:08,580
so it's about the the world as a mosaic

1997
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,760
it's about geographical difference

1998
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:13,580
sensitivity to contexts

1999
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:17,580
and also thinking relationally so how

2000
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:20,580
does something that happens in Brussels

2001
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,280
connects to Kinshasa for instance so

2002
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,199
it's about connections between places

2003
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:27,600
but these are not I mean I'm not saying

2004
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,239
these are ideal definitions

2005
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:33,420
by far not but we can be inspired and

2006
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,280
fix certain things from

2007
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:38,159
American Association of geographers used

2008
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,540
to be the association of American

2009
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:42,120
geographers by the way but they changed

2010
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:44,520
their name to reflect more diverse

2011
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:48,480
audience uh in the community

2012
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,460
you want to understand the world's final

2013
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:52,860
start with the River City a mountain a

2014
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,840
village a road and follow it to the ends

2015
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,940
of the Earth geography asked the big

2016
01:35:56,940 --> 01:36:01,020
questions where how why what if as you

2017
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:02,940
were saying and gives you the

2018
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:04,920
perspective to answer them with advanced

2019
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,719
technology and the solid knowledge of

2020
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,659
the world in which we all live okay so

2021
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:12,719
follow your nose Trace connections uh

2022
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:15,540
and indeed ask these big questions where

2023
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:18,420
perhaps in other disciplines

2024
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:22,739
um there's less space to do so okay

2025
01:36:22,739 --> 01:36:25,199
by the way if you go to the original you

2026
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:27,659
could say literal Greek transcription is

2027
01:36:27,659 --> 01:36:30,540
Earth description

2028
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:33,000
um but that doesn't tell you that much

2029
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,820
right it's a standard definition would

2030
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:39,960
be to describe uh human activity at the

2031
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:43,020
interface of uh and with with the Earth

2032
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:46,139
or something like that so it somehow

2033
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:48,840
goes back to a very descriptive idea of

2034
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:51,719
what geography should be uh not

2035
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:54,060
necessarily producing any analytical

2036
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:57,120
knowledge or explanatory knowledge okay

2037
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,780
so I tend to not to like that definition

2038
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:02,699
too much but

2039
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:05,639
in original Greek it's what it means

2040
01:37:05,639 --> 01:37:06,780
okay

2041
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:09,239
now to further a little bit there and I

2042
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:11,340
think I mean this going a little bit

2043
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:12,780
more

2044
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:15,000
um towards my own expectation as well

2045
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,040
just another quote

2046
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,260
uh take from the handbook While most

2047
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:21,120
social science disciplines can be

2048
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,820
roughly defined by what they study the

2049
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:25,500
economy culture society and so on

2050
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,719
geography is defined by how we stand so

2051
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:29,940
that was what you were saying

2052
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,980
and so the World by our approach

2053
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,719
geographers study the economy Society

2054
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:35,699
politics and culture too but a

2055
01:37:35,699 --> 01:37:37,440
geographical perspective is one that

2056
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,500
emphasizes space it is approached to any

2057
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:43,020
of these subjects so it's not just that

2058
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:46,739
we can claim uh like political

2059
01:37:46,739 --> 01:37:49,380
scientists or like economists this kind

2060
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:52,260
of thematic field it's really our you

2061
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:55,440
could say theoretical and analytical

2062
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,980
working with the notion of space space

2063
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:02,040
as something that explains what human

2064
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:06,000
activity as it interacts with its

2065
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,080
environment that really

2066
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:12,060
identifies so sets us apart as

2067
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,159
geographers from us yeah just the

2068
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:15,360
questions the how is this definition

2069
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:18,139
that any difference from you know

2070
01:38:18,139 --> 01:38:21,300
sociology as a whole

2071
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,520
but because there would be far less

2072
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,020
attention to space

2073
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:26,639
I would say

2074
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,340
that's so childhood sociology isn't that

2075
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:31,320
space it's also defined how human

2076
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,120
interactions go

2077
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:36,920
like that the whole point is

2078
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:40,500
how space defines house I wouldn't think

2079
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,199
so I think sociologists would would

2080
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:46,380
start with particular yeah

2081
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,480
um histories perhaps look at the

2082
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,840
relations organizational forms uh

2083
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,179
perhaps identity those kind of processes

2084
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:57,120
but I think and they perhaps they may

2085
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,000
describe variety

2086
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,100
uh across different contexts in one way

2087
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:04,139
or another but perhaps they would not

2088
01:39:04,139 --> 01:39:08,159
use geography to explain uh

2089
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:12,659
those differences so for instance I mean

2090
01:39:12,659 --> 01:39:14,040
I mean what could I think of as an

2091
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,620
example I mean when you when you try to

2092
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:19,320
understand urban life

2093
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:22,080
uh being sensitive to how you're

2094
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:26,820
inserted uh in a Global Network of uh of

2095
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:29,280
cities could be

2096
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,080
um could be one way to appreciate your

2097
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,239
own positionality so if you're a citizen

2098
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:36,000
of a city like in Shasta which is an

2099
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,940
exploitative or subordinate relation to

2100
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:41,159
other cities in the world it may give

2101
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:43,500
you a hint of why your living conditions

2102
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:47,100
are that bad whereas sociologists May

2103
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:50,159
perhaps start explaining that from local

2104
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:52,980
cultures uh local societal

2105
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:55,500
characteristics political systems Etc a

2106
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,260
geographer would for instance try to put

2107
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,360
that in perspective and say look there's

2108
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,400
an overarching system

2109
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:05,100
a world system of sorts maybe we can

2110
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,639
talk about this next week that allows to

2111
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,620
explain uh that a little bit better

2112
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,179
okay I don't but I think yeah and that

2113
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:20,219
connects a little bit to the to the next

2114
01:40:20,219 --> 01:40:22,920
uh thing and the sociological

2115
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:26,280
imagination and these are the words uh I

2116
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,440
mean this is what what David Harvey

2117
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,780
writes and social justice in the city

2118
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,760
it enables the possessor to understand

2119
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,739
the larger historical scene in terms of

2120
01:40:34,739 --> 01:40:36,780
its meaning for inner life and external

2121
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:39,420
career a variety of individuals so the

2122
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,340
sociological imagination enables us to

2123
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,440
grasp history history and biography and

2124
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,000
the relation between the two in society

2125
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,460
so it's about think about issues like

2126
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:50,880
class and how knowledge is produced uh

2127
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,880
what kind of questions that you ask that

2128
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:56,040
are predefined for not predefined by

2129
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:59,639
shaped by our by your own class identity

2130
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:01,620
for instance or epic identity to

2131
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,960
acknowledge that would be one thing but

2132
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,639
Harvey says the spatial imagination

2133
01:41:05,639 --> 01:41:07,620
enables the individual to recognize the

2134
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:09,300
role of space and place in some

2135
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:12,719
biography so like for instance somebody

2136
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:15,739
from South Africa who starts teaching

2137
01:41:15,739 --> 01:41:18,500
in in London

2138
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,300
in

2139
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:22,560
as a geographer

2140
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,980
how with this personal trajectory uh

2141
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:28,920
lead to some kind of a focus on issues

2142
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,659
of what is modernity what is

2143
01:41:30,659 --> 01:41:33,060
non-modernity what is development what

2144
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:34,679
is under development and those kind of

2145
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:37,580
things so how for instance on a career

2146
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:40,380
as a scholar from the global South going

2147
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,239
to the global North might shape the

2148
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:44,340
questions that are being asked

2149
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:46,980
next to just issues of class ethnicity

2150
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:49,320
and other elements that may shape

2151
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,820
positionality

2152
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:52,679
I could use the example of Jennifer

2153
01:41:52,679 --> 01:41:54,960
Robinson for instance who fits this

2154
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,760
exercise and she came up with the idea

2155
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,060
of ordinary cities somehow debunking the

2156
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:01,980
whole idea that would be extraordinary

2157
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:06,119
world cities and then the rest okay so

2158
01:42:06,119 --> 01:42:08,040
just saying that in your personal

2159
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,960
biographies

2160
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:12,840
your spatial trajectory and your spatial

2161
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,119
relations with other places may also

2162
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,520
have an impact on the kind of questions

2163
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,460
uh that you're they're asking I'm not

2164
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:23,580
saying that uh sociologists are blind

2165
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:25,739
but they they just ask different kind of

2166
01:42:25,739 --> 01:42:26,699
questions

2167
01:42:26,699 --> 01:42:27,960
okay

2168
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:30,179
now for me I mean these are difficult

2169
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:32,100
theoretical discussions it's also not an

2170
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,560
epistemological

2171
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:36,960
epistemology class but I think it's safe

2172
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,659
to say that as as human geographers

2173
01:42:39,659 --> 01:42:42,179
we're interested in uh the interactions

2174
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:45,360
between space and Society how spaces

2175
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:48,179
shape societies and individuals and vice

2176
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:51,060
versa how individuals and societies

2177
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:54,000
space shape their environments and this

2178
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,980
is kind of what

2179
01:42:55,980 --> 01:43:00,119
at soja a famous uh American geographer

2180
01:43:00,119 --> 01:43:03,360
calls an association dialectic

2181
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,699
um and it's and then you translate that

2182
01:43:05,699 --> 01:43:09,360
to cities it's how Urban societies make

2183
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:12,300
the places they live in and at the same

2184
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,420
time how Urban space morphologically or

2185
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:18,480
otherwise has again back an influence on

2186
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,300
urban life as as groups and individuals

2187
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:24,719
think about segregation which shows a

2188
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:27,060
segregated social structure

2189
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:29,219
it's something social but it also will

2190
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:31,320
Define the kind of interactions that you

2191
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:34,260
have with others in urban space and they

2192
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:35,699
have an impact on what kind of

2193
01:43:35,699 --> 01:43:37,980
encounters you have in the city may have

2194
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,780
an impact on

2195
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,179
how privileged you are

2196
01:43:42,179 --> 01:43:45,659
um to what extent you know other social

2197
01:43:45,659 --> 01:43:48,719
groups and Society Etc so space one

2198
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:50,639
example that killing to the work of Nick

2199
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:51,780
later on

2200
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:54,840
that shows that space has in itself some

2201
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:57,360
kind of an autonomous form of

2202
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:01,199
uh explanation I'm very uh defensive as

2203
01:44:01,199 --> 01:44:03,840
a geographer as you can see because as

2204
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,000
all geographers I have an identity

2205
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,739
crisis

2206
01:44:07,739 --> 01:44:09,600
um but that's kind of a very productive

2207
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,340
one I would say because this kind of

2208
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:14,400
typifies the history of post-war history

2209
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,860
of geography and maybe other geographers

2210
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:19,380
will will recognize that

2211
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:21,960
um yeah so the social spatial dialectic

2212
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,360
perhaps this is as a synthesis what we

2213
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:27,420
can land on how society's people make

2214
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:29,460
spaces and how it works back to them and

2215
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,659
thinking about

2216
01:44:30,659 --> 01:44:34,320
the autonomous power of space and

2217
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:35,699
explaining stuff

2218
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:40,260
as an example if I can can I

2219
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:42,659
yes

2220
01:44:42,659 --> 01:44:44,639
four ways and I mean you mentioned it

2221
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:46,500
already it's thinking about different

2222
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:49,020
concepts of space territory scale

2223
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:51,900
networks plays are for common ways of

2224
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,880
thinking about space

2225
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:56,460
and they point to different kind of

2226
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:59,820
spatial processes and again it's not

2227
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:02,219
that one is better than the other to

2228
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:04,800
understand what is happening but as I

2229
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,100
will try to show by the example Brussels

2230
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:10,860
kind of seeking tension between these

2231
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:13,380
different concepts that get us gets us a

2232
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:15,780
little bit closer to understanding for

2233
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:18,239
instance in this case the conundrum that

2234
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:21,540
Brussels supposed so one way of looking

2235
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:25,139
at the city of Brussels is a territorial

2236
01:45:25,139 --> 01:45:27,540
one it has a particular jurisdiction

2237
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,940
it's the Brussels Capital Region which

2238
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,739
emerged as a region somewhere in the

2239
01:45:31,739 --> 01:45:35,520
1990s next to Flanders and malonia

2240
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,580
and it has certain competences it has a

2241
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:40,800
government a parliament we can do stuff

2242
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,440
besides stuff on its territory

2243
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,260
but not on culture because that's uh

2244
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,840
something that is being decided by

2245
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,540
flowers and the francophone Community

2246
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:54,300
but other than that there's kind of

2247
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:57,600
sovereignty uh on that level uh as what

2248
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,460
can be designed so it's a very strict

2249
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:02,520
kind of banded space if you walk 10

2250
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:05,040
meters outside those boundaries in

2251
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,260
principle uh the Brussels government

2252
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:10,080
can't say anything about you

2253
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:13,139
um and on the other hand it's also can

2254
01:46:13,139 --> 01:46:15,900
erect all kinds of barriers if Flanders

2255
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:18,659
wants to add another Lane to the Ring

2256
01:46:18,659 --> 01:46:21,179
Road across Brussels because it is very

2257
01:46:21,179 --> 01:46:23,699
centered on on car Mobility

2258
01:46:23,699 --> 01:46:25,860
well there's ways of blocking that

2259
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:27,179
because

2260
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:29,219
um there's certain stretches of the Ring

2261
01:46:29,219 --> 01:46:31,980
Road where Brussels can say no let's not

2262
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,960
do that here and in the end you end up

2263
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:36,000
still with the bottlenecks okay so this

2264
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,760
is territorial power to some extent uh

2265
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,460
which has also been used uh by the

2266
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:43,580
Brussels government saying everything

2267
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:47,580
is 50 kilometers an hour max When you

2268
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:51,420
entered the depart territory uh so yeah

2269
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:54,179
um take it or leave it

2270
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:55,980
so with territorial view of what

2271
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:58,260
Brussels could be a second one it would

2272
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,840
be a more scalar View

2273
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,619
and scale

2274
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:07,159
to

2275
01:47:07,159 --> 01:47:09,600
different processes work on different

2276
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,400
scales some of them are really micro

2277
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:14,460
teaching is a micro process taking place

2278
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:17,219
in the at the scale here of the

2279
01:47:17,219 --> 01:47:19,400
classroom

2280
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,840
whereas you could say commuting is

2281
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,239
something that takes place at a far

2282
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,280
larger scale as we go home it's a

2283
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:29,820
process That's radically goes beyond the

2284
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:32,340
boundaries of of this class okay it's

2285
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:33,960
the same when you look at economic

2286
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,940
activities

2287
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:37,500
um as you if you look at the

2288
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,739
Metropolitan Area morphologically

2289
01:47:39,739 --> 01:47:43,440
Brussels is actually much larger than

2290
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:46,199
the Brussels Capital Region so if we

2291
01:47:46,199 --> 01:47:49,260
were to Define Brussels as a scale of

2292
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:52,260
where Urban activities take place

2293
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:56,159
you could end up halfway to Flanders or

2294
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:58,739
halfway to Bologna okay so it radically

2295
01:47:58,739 --> 01:48:00,480
deep borders

2296
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,159
um the territory that is the Brussels

2297
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:03,600
capital region

2298
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:07,139
in contrast to other contexts

2299
01:48:07,139 --> 01:48:09,960
um there has not been a very uh

2300
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:12,960
successful process of we could say City

2301
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,900
regionalization where there was some

2302
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,179
kind of

2303
01:48:17,179 --> 01:48:20,219
governance expansion to manage the

2304
01:48:20,219 --> 01:48:22,440
Metropolitan uh process and a lot of

2305
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,960
context we see that new governance

2306
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,760
structures have been erected think about

2307
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:28,560
London for instance

2308
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:32,100
uh it hugely exceeds uh the original

2309
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,020
Heartland of London but includes more

2310
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:36,000
and more of its peripheries because

2311
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,119
these places are connected to

2312
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,820
um to the urban area okay this is not

2313
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:43,380
what happened in Brussels and this has

2314
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:46,139
something to do with the fact that

2315
01:48:46,139 --> 01:48:49,199
there's a very communitarian uh

2316
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:51,540
sensitive issue okay because it deals

2317
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:53,340
with all kinds of issues of

2318
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:57,179
redistribution of uh of income Etc we

2319
01:48:57,179 --> 01:48:59,580
have to keep in mind that about 60 of

2320
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:03,300
Belgian GDP is generated in Brussels uh

2321
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:06,119
but it's not being governed into in its

2322
01:49:06,119 --> 01:49:08,639
totality by the Brussels government

2323
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:10,739
in fact and that brings us to the third

2324
01:49:10,739 --> 01:49:13,560
one it's a network perspective

2325
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,260
there's all kinds of micro networks in

2326
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,239
this case this is the commuting map of

2327
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,940
Belgium that makes that the Surplus that

2328
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:22,560
is being generated by all these

2329
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,960
activities and Brussels I think about

2330
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,239
headquarter functions European functions

2331
01:49:27,239 --> 01:49:29,639
that apparently account for a quarter of

2332
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:32,520
the Brussels economy it actually leaks

2333
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,520
to the periphery so it leaks beyond the

2334
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,080
borders of this territory of the

2335
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,600
Brussels Capital Region a lot of people

2336
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:45,179
including myself work in Brussels but

2337
01:49:45,179 --> 01:49:49,679
um basically pay taxes outside of

2338
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:52,500
Brussels so I live in against this

2339
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,380
beautiful other city

2340
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:58,619
in Belgium and I yeah I get texts and

2341
01:49:58,619 --> 01:50:01,920
Flanders uh I spent a lot of money well

2342
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,020
not so much because I work too much I

2343
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:07,320
could spend a lot of money in Ghent

2344
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:09,239
um but it basically is some kind of

2345
01:50:09,239 --> 01:50:12,420
physical leakage from uh from territory

2346
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:13,460
right

2347
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:17,100
and uh this is a problem with Brussels

2348
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:19,800
we also could talk about uh eurocrats

2349
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:23,040
who are not taxed at all but work in

2350
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,500
Brussels so we can wonder about the

2351
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,420
multiplier economic multiplier that's

2352
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:29,100
being created by all these activities in

2353
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,320
Brussels and that means that yeah

2354
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,480
there's a lot of a large visiting class

2355
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:36,239
about 400 000 commuters come to Brussels

2356
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:40,260
every uh every day well pre-corona let's

2357
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:41,820
see if it's still the case

2358
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:45,480
uh but they use a city they spend uh

2359
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:47,639
time on on the infrastructure but not

2360
01:50:47,639 --> 01:50:50,159
necessarily paying for that

2361
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:52,500
and now it's very details of other kinds

2362
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:55,320
of ways of arranging that as solidarity

2363
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,480
than between the regions of flounders

2364
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,580
for instance space

2365
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:01,920
um a number of buildings every year to

2366
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,860
Brussels as a sign of solidarity where

2367
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:07,380
you can also frame it as just paying the

2368
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:09,239
bill for being on the Metro in Brussels

2369
01:51:09,239 --> 01:51:12,719
using it every day and so this kind of a

2370
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,780
discussion there

2371
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:17,780
and it also is framed in very

2372
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:22,080
identitarian communitarian terms

2373
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,179
and this is kind of when you use a

2374
01:51:24,179 --> 01:51:26,520
concept like place

2375
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:27,119
um

2376
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:29,460
gets you a bit closer to this process of

2377
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:31,739
how people attach meanings to some place

2378
01:51:31,739 --> 01:51:34,380
so Brussels and how it's represented in

2379
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:36,659
Belgian Media or Flemish media I invite

2380
01:51:36,659 --> 01:51:41,460
you to uh buy a Flemish newspaper and

2381
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:43,739
run it through Google to see how

2382
01:51:43,739 --> 01:51:45,600
Brussels is being represented as a

2383
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,340
particular frame

2384
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:50,780
um which has been augmented uh or

2385
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:54,659
centralized even further as we had the

2386
01:51:54,659 --> 01:51:57,540
terrorist attacks in 2016

2387
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:01,260
um where even Mr former president Trump

2388
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:03,739
describe to normal and big as a hellhole

2389
01:52:03,739 --> 01:52:06,960
and was very nicely taken over by

2390
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:08,639
Flemish media because it kind of

2391
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:11,119
resonates with the idea of yeah

2392
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:12,920
unsafe

2393
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:16,260
image of Brussels

2394
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:17,119
um

2395
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:20,159
dirty image of Brussels

2396
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:20,880
um

2397
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:23,580
and yeah so it kind of resonates there

2398
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:26,100
and what you see is especially is that

2399
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:28,199
yeah this is also you could say

2400
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:30,540
reenacted in the in the entire covet

2401
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:33,300
crisis where again it's the same frame

2402
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:36,480
of yeah Brussels can't manage look at

2403
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,820
vaccination rates it doesn't get its

2404
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:40,500
population under control they're messing

2405
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,199
up again if we were independent and

2406
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:44,540
flounders

2407
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:47,760
yeah that we could be have all kinds of

2408
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,340
other covet regulations etc etc would be

2409
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:53,280
free already so it's kind of this Frame

2410
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,040
of attaching certain meanings uh to

2411
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:58,760
certain places so if you just go to

2412
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:02,580
lidocack or you could also like they'll

2413
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:05,820
be it's a big sign but flaming and

2414
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:07,980
Thursday so it's

2415
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:09,619
it's

2416
01:53:09,619 --> 01:53:13,320
yeah I would say somewhere here

2417
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:16,679
so it's really dependent on um

2418
01:53:16,679 --> 01:53:19,440
on Brussels in terms of commuting but

2419
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:22,080
what you see is that with the kind of

2420
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,340
um return

2421
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:26,400
of higher end residential functions the

2422
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,159
city uh to the city of Brussels that is

2423
01:53:29,159 --> 01:53:31,619
actually a lot of displacement going on

2424
01:53:31,619 --> 01:53:34,199
and a lot of people that used to live in

2425
01:53:34,199 --> 01:53:36,119
what they call the residual housing

2426
01:53:36,119 --> 01:53:37,800
market still affordable housing in

2427
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:40,460
Brussels it's actually being pushed out

2428
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:42,980
and is increasingly

2429
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:45,360
commuting to Brussels from further and

2430
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:48,719
further away so in a sense you could say

2431
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:51,780
um Brussels is spilling over all the way

2432
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:53,820
to leader character and what you see is

2433
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:55,440
that there is a very strong opposition

2434
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:59,639
by uh identitarian parties a local mayor

2435
01:53:59,639 --> 01:54:01,760
which has really tried to

2436
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:04,820
form a kind of a Bridgehead if you will

2437
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:08,780
towards all that is foreign

2438
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:16,980
uh to this process of urbanization there

2439
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:19,380
and we can think about it uh what what

2440
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:20,820
we want but it's certainly something

2441
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:23,219
that is that is explaining a lot of the

2442
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:26,460
tensions between Brussels and it's it's

2443
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:28,980
growing Hinterland

2444
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:32,100
so four takes of the Brussels to four

2445
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:34,080
different kind of spatial

2446
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:38,639
uh approaches and I think combining them

2447
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:41,639
tells us a bit more about what on Earth

2448
01:54:41,639 --> 01:54:45,600
Brussels as a city is

2449
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,760
um okay

2450
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,139
um

2451
01:54:49,139 --> 01:54:51,060
is there still time do you still have

2452
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:53,340
time for one minute of thinking about

2453
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:55,679
what being critical means

2454
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:58,199
I think in eight minutes we can stop so

2455
01:54:58,199 --> 01:54:59,639
one minute

2456
01:54:59,639 --> 01:55:03,119
of thinking of what is critical not in a

2457
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:05,100
sense your condition is critical but

2458
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:07,920
what is critical Urban studies or

2459
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,440
critical urban geography for you what

2460
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:13,100
does that mean

2461
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,360
um

2462
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:28,760
the countryside

2463
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:52,790
[Music]

2464
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:05,159
being critical

2465
01:56:05,159 --> 01:56:08,239
what does that mean

2466
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:11,719
the ideas

2467
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:25,199
are the absolute on the students

2468
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:28,199
yeah so yeah questioning what you hear

2469
01:56:28,199 --> 01:56:32,520
what you see okay okay

2470
01:56:33,239 --> 01:56:34,920
making sure

2471
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:36,900
all right

2472
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:40,580
people who are the person yeah

2473
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:44,940
so it connects a bit to what you were

2474
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:47,699
saying uh fact-checking certain

2475
01:56:47,699 --> 01:56:49,020
statements

2476
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:52,340
uh see where your ideas come from yeah

2477
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:55,520
just being aware of your own biases like

2478
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,080
confirmation bias sharing thinking about

2479
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:00,540
something it's a huge help with being

2480
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:02,880
critical as well cherry picking what is

2481
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,800
that can you explain that traffic is the

2482
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:10,139
selective picking of your sources

2483
01:57:10,139 --> 01:57:14,099
uh while you have Ida and you only code

2484
01:57:14,099 --> 01:57:17,040
source that also save others that also

2485
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,840
represent the idea it's regarding all

2486
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:21,179
the other end yeah so you go back from

2487
01:57:21,179 --> 01:57:23,639
the results to uh to the data selection

2488
01:57:23,639 --> 01:57:26,940
yeah yeah so being reflexive about your

2489
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:30,380
own ideas yes exactly

2490
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,080
required

2491
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:39,900
mm-hmm

2492
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:42,139
in the words

2493
01:57:42,139 --> 01:57:44,940
caring caring

2494
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:48,239
uh and and okay and and caring how how

2495
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:52,040
exactly that's an interesting term

2496
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,119
s

2497
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:55,619
and then

2498
01:57:55,619 --> 01:57:58,440
it will be like analyzing extracting and

2499
01:57:58,440 --> 01:57:59,940
like practice

2500
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:03,739
and and what should we care about

2501
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:06,260
um

2502
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:10,080
true that's yeah any particular process

2503
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:13,560
yeah uh I think it implies being

2504
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:16,800
politically having an approach that is

2505
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,400
politically engaged and also maybe

2506
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:23,360
building upon his answer

2507
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:26,400
listening to different actors and

2508
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,920
especially the marginalized and not the

2509
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:32,060
the what do you call them

2510
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:36,619
official sources of knowledge okay

2511
01:58:36,619 --> 01:58:40,219
interesting yeah

2512
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:47,460
it can also be accepting that there is

2513
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:49,880
no classes

2514
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:54,860
but like everything in the context and

2515
01:59:01,139 --> 01:59:03,199
okay

2516
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:06,360
yeah I have to hold myself not a good

2517
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:08,699
discussion but it's an interesting point

2518
01:59:08,699 --> 01:59:10,800
I think it's about being critical about

2519
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,860
what effect is personally I would say be

2520
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:16,380
sensitive how to how effect is produced

2521
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:20,820
to use blue laptop in the sense that if

2522
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:23,699
you put men in white jackets it would

2523
01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:25,860
give certain people them more power to

2524
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:28,199
actually produce a fact whereas other

2525
01:59:28,199 --> 01:59:30,420
voices marginal voices will not be in

2526
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:32,460
that position yeah

2527
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:33,619
um

2528
01:59:33,619 --> 01:59:36,599
like a field level it involves like

2529
01:59:36,599 --> 01:59:39,239
taking care of the implications of the

2530
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:41,340
way you're conceptualizing things are in

2531
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:44,219
terms of economic and social impacts of

2532
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:45,619
that and then

2533
01:59:45,619 --> 01:59:48,000
re-evaluating the theory sort of

2534
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,800
Frameworks that you're using based on

2535
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:51,360
what you're finding on that yeah

2536
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,520
interesting so it's again being

2537
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,619
reflexive about your own positionality

2538
01:59:55,619 --> 01:59:59,159
trying to tease out to what extents uh

2539
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:00,960
your positionality shapes the questions

2540
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,699
you ask

2541
02:00:02,699 --> 02:00:05,400
um and then try to address that one way

2542
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:09,199
or another it's not easy yeah

2543
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,840
um

2544
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:28,820
foreign

2545
02:00:33,139 --> 02:00:35,639
label process

2546
02:00:35,639 --> 02:00:39,000
where some voices sound louder than

2547
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,260
others

2548
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,900
it reproduces stuff like that it also

2549
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:46,440
has geographical uh implications because

2550
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:48,900
it's not just some people I mean it

2551
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:51,420
overlays with spatial structures I think

2552
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:54,900
about it Global diploma Global cells

2553
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:57,780
okay thanks a lot I mean uh exactly I

2554
02:00:57,780 --> 02:01:00,480
mean I have not so much to add to that

2555
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,940
you can take the definition of of Jonas

2556
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:05,040
at all and I think it captures some of

2557
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:08,280
the things that were being said uh think

2558
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:10,980
about New Concepts that reveal something

2559
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:13,080
that we didn't know yet it's kind of

2560
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:15,179
obvious but still

2561
02:01:15,179 --> 02:01:18,599
um think about being politically engaged

2562
02:01:18,599 --> 02:01:22,260
yes something that matters uh one way or

2563
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:25,020
another but be reflexive about the fact

2564
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:27,119
that some things might really matter

2565
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:29,340
being picked up but not necessarily be

2566
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:32,159
uh you could say very Progressive I mean

2567
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:35,340
in a fascist Society there's all kinds

2568
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:38,040
of knowledge on segregation to be

2569
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,960
produced that is very useful and it

2570
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,760
could be extremely politically engaged

2571
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:45,300
in that but not necessarily uh

2572
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:46,920
thinking about you could say

2573
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:49,040
marginalized forces there

2574
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:51,719
third Point indeed taking seriously the

2575
02:01:51,719 --> 02:01:53,360
experiences lies practicing words of

2576
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:56,580
ordinary Urban residents

2577
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:58,739
or marginalized social groups to think

2578
02:01:58,739 --> 02:02:01,020
about really okay we have this hegemonic

2579
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:03,179
representation

2580
02:02:03,179 --> 02:02:04,739
what would happen if we would ask

2581
02:02:04,739 --> 02:02:06,300
different people if we start in a

2582
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:08,179
different positionality etc etc

2583
02:02:08,179 --> 02:02:11,760
obviously you have your positionality as

2584
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:14,159
a researcher on yourself

2585
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,139
and it may be sometimes very hard for

2586
02:02:16,139 --> 02:02:19,199
instance as a man to study feminist

2587
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:22,699
perspectives it may also be not

2588
02:02:22,699 --> 02:02:26,520
recognized as being a rightful person to

2589
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:29,460
studying these kind of aspects so I

2590
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:31,800
think it's a it's it's a kind of a a

2591
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:34,139
negotiation process there and then again

2592
02:02:34,139 --> 02:02:36,480
or think about

2593
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:39,960
um women that that focus on

2594
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:43,619
the eliteness of investment banking in

2595
02:02:43,619 --> 02:02:45,540
the city think about work of Linda

2596
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:49,619
McDowell for instance and how how it's a

2597
02:02:49,619 --> 02:02:51,239
difficult process for women to actually

2598
02:02:51,239 --> 02:02:54,480
enter these spaces have access but once

2599
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,099
they get access they ask very different

2600
02:02:56,099 --> 02:02:58,320
questions and they'll actually lead to

2601
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:02,280
quite uh revolutionary insights

2602
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:04,320
an alternative formulation and that's

2603
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,659
why I was a little bit hesitant with uh

2604
02:03:06,659 --> 02:03:09,719
there are no facts I don't agree I think

2605
02:03:09,719 --> 02:03:11,340
there are

2606
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:14,219
um effects facts in a sense that there

2607
02:03:14,219 --> 02:03:18,060
are factual realities and a new series

2608
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:21,300
kind of um kind of Middle Ground between

2609
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:22,920
you could say

2610
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:24,960
um truth as being something that's being

2611
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,159
constructed

2612
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:28,500
but you always have to construct it on

2613
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:30,900
the basis of some kind of empirical

2614
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:35,219
factual reality uh so not a radical

2615
02:03:35,219 --> 02:03:37,679
deconstruction or post-structuralist

2616
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:40,619
thinking uh there's always a way of

2617
02:03:40,619 --> 02:03:42,840
saying this is I don't know the entire

2618
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:45,239
truth but this is probably a little bit

2619
02:03:45,239 --> 02:03:47,520
more true than something else

2620
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,699
and yeah you can write the citation uh

2621
02:03:50,699 --> 02:03:52,400
read the citation sorry

2622
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:55,020
what he says is that the ultimate goal

2623
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:57,420
is to reduce uh

2624
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:01,080
illusion in society in and of itself so

2625
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:03,440
if you have shark

2626
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:06,659
periodical analytical categories and

2627
02:04:06,659 --> 02:04:08,940
Concepts you can work with that and you

2628
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,320
will see things perhaps in a different

2629
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:14,219
light and take away as

2630
02:04:14,219 --> 02:04:16,980
false beliefs and Illusions in society

2631
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:20,360
and it also means that it's a kind of a

2632
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:22,860
placeless and Timeless definition in the

2633
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:24,719
sense that this could be the mission for

2634
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:26,820
instance of critical Urban studies or

2635
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:28,800
critical urban geography and what is

2636
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:31,199
critical and what is a false belief and

2637
02:04:31,199 --> 02:04:33,119
what is an illusion may change over time

2638
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:35,699
so it's kind of it keeps holding the

2639
02:04:35,699 --> 02:04:38,699
definition but it may have to be updated

2640
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:42,000
in terms of how it works and exactly so

2641
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,920
some rules of thumb

2642
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:44,639
um

2643
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:47,159
there's no universal theory of any

2644
02:04:47,159 --> 02:04:50,460
anything and I think we'll uh we'll show

2645
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:54,000
that uh we have to be sensitive to the

2646
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,219
fact that every theory has its

2647
02:04:56,219 --> 02:04:57,960
birthmarks

2648
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:00,780
what were the questions uh that really

2649
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:03,659
gave rise to formulating a research

2650
02:05:03,659 --> 02:05:05,639
question to a theory in a particular way

2651
02:05:05,639 --> 02:05:08,400
well we'll have to take a look at the

2652
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,619
context about historically and spatially

2653
02:05:10,619 --> 02:05:14,159
uh to understand uh what that was so

2654
02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:16,860
think about The Chicago School that

2655
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:19,340
you'll be talking about with Nick

2656
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:22,500
it's it was assumed to be Universal

2657
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:24,719
model there's actually a model of a city

2658
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:28,920
that captures rapid urbanization in the

2659
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:31,139
early 20th century in Northern America

2660
02:05:31,139 --> 02:05:33,060
and then the question to an extent that

2661
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:34,440
actually explains something in different

2662
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:36,239
locations in different times

2663
02:05:36,239 --> 02:05:38,400
we're not going to reject that but we

2664
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,139
have to mobilize that concept and see

2665
02:05:40,139 --> 02:05:41,460
how far we get

2666
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:43,800
so we have to be reflexive about these

2667
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:46,440
bird marks so yeah even the concept of

2668
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:49,020
class is something that is a western

2669
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:50,820
Inception if you will

2670
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:52,739
to what extent does it allow to actually

2671
02:05:52,739 --> 02:05:55,739
capture for instance Indian Society

2672
02:05:55,739 --> 02:05:58,440
so we need to kind of provincialize

2673
02:05:58,440 --> 02:06:00,900
theory and say okay it originated at

2674
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:03,599
some point and now we can meaningfully

2675
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:05,520
think about how we can speak across

2676
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:07,980
context so think about

2677
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:08,880
um

2678
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:11,520
a global city has a concept that emerged

2679
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,560
say mostly in in Northern America

2680
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:15,659
Western Europe what extent does it allow

2681
02:06:15,659 --> 02:06:17,400
to capture what is going on in Singapore

2682
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:20,760
for instance so to play uh while being

2683
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:23,699
reflexive about these Concepts uh with

2684
02:06:23,699 --> 02:06:25,679
the application across

2685
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:28,320
and engages pluralism that's kind of I

2686
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,239
mean might be for engaged pluralism it

2687
02:06:30,239 --> 02:06:31,440
means that there are different kind of

2688
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:33,300
theoretical stances different kind of

2689
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:35,340
questions being asked entering from

2690
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:37,920
different kind of teams and I think it's

2691
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,580
not just about

2692
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:42,540
acknowledging that but it's actually

2693
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:44,699
engaging with this kind of descent

2694
02:06:44,699 --> 02:06:47,340
opinions and try to look for a

2695
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:49,020
conversation and

2696
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:50,699
maybe we can talk a little bit more

2697
02:06:50,699 --> 02:06:52,260
about that next week or in the next

2698
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:53,400
sessions

2699
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:56,400
as Urban Studies have grown and kind of

2700
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,860
become ever more Global as the

2701
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:01,320
urbanization has also globalized there's

2702
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:04,020
always a risk that has some

2703
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:06,960
um work that we become lost in in

2704
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:09,300
comparison to use the words of Jamie

2705
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:11,280
pack that we lose our points of

2706
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,380
reference they actually be able to to

2707
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:15,960
have some kind of coherent Urban studies

2708
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:18,540
project or at least speak to one another

2709
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:21,060
so I think there's a danger with a

2710
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:23,040
Global Research agenda with so many

2711
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,320
contextual differences how do we still

2712
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:27,719
make sense of urban processes in

2713
02:07:27,719 --> 02:07:31,320
Singapore versus uh versus Brussels how

2714
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:33,119
do you prepare

2715
02:07:33,119 --> 02:07:35,280
now I won't bore you now to death with

2716
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,320
the next few slides too much but I just

2717
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:39,000
want to say

2718
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,820
um that what geography was and what kind

2719
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:44,340
of critical questions were asked has

2720
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:47,760
changed tremendously uh throughout time

2721
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:50,820
much of geography originally was

2722
02:07:50,820 --> 02:07:53,580
really about human interaction with the

2723
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:55,500
environment

2724
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:56,580
um

2725
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:59,460
say environmental determinism where it

2726
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:01,320
was really believed yes it's really the

2727
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,060
physical environment that will shape

2728
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:05,099
human activities

2729
02:08:05,099 --> 02:08:07,440
Regional geography was also a very big

2730
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,599
tradition especially before the second

2731
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:11,639
world war where it was really about this

2732
02:08:11,639 --> 02:08:14,639
description of human activities in their

2733
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:16,560
physical media there's still some

2734
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,179
tradition there but what really happened

2735
02:08:18,179 --> 02:08:20,699
after the second world war boasts were

2736
02:08:20,699 --> 02:08:22,860
area especially since the 70s it was a

2737
02:08:22,860 --> 02:08:25,080
period of let's say great social and

2738
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:28,260
political and economic upheaval is a

2739
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:31,199
huge branching out of

2740
02:08:31,199 --> 02:08:33,900
um of geography so that's quite a

2741
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:37,320
plurality of traditions there and they

2742
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:39,599
take us quite far from the the origins

2743
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:42,080
of geography was was really about

2744
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:45,619
settlements if you will and then in the

2745
02:08:45,619 --> 02:08:49,320
pre-World War era was about okay show

2746
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,119
East Anglia and where are the

2747
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:54,119
settlements or describe me the structure

2748
02:08:54,119 --> 02:08:57,119
of a city after the second world war

2749
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:59,880
especially in the 80s it was a kind of a

2750
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:01,860
nomothetic move and the kind of we have

2751
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:03,960
to formalize this and you have for

2752
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:07,560
instance Boulder Crystal who came with a

2753
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:10,440
quite a neat model to explain why at

2754
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:12,119
certain locations you had certain

2755
02:09:12,119 --> 02:09:15,540
settlements of a certain size or for

2756
02:09:15,540 --> 02:09:18,360
instance he owns a much more such

2757
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:21,300
formalizing the idea okay if there's

2758
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:23,219
certain activities within a city at a

2759
02:09:23,219 --> 02:09:25,139
certain space it must have something to

2760
02:09:25,139 --> 02:09:27,000
do with the kind of value that is being

2761
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,420
generated by those activities and the

2762
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:32,880
fact that some activities outfit others

2763
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,920
on a certain location so these are kind

2764
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:37,139
of foundational approaches and I'm going

2765
02:09:37,139 --> 02:09:40,320
very fast here I know but it's just to

2766
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:43,860
take note of that this led to a much

2767
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:48,000
more plural uh discussion as of the 70s

2768
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,940
and I I can't really do justice to all

2769
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:53,760
these different Traditions here but what

2770
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,440
you could say more radical and critical

2771
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:58,380
voices uh share in one tradition you

2772
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:00,239
could say yes questions of social

2773
02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:04,739
justice uh distribution they work in a

2774
02:10:04,739 --> 02:10:07,619
materialist setting so what people have

2775
02:10:07,619 --> 02:10:10,500
and how does class for instance income

2776
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:13,340
Etc plus how does that explain divisions

2777
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:16,080
in the city

2778
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:19,320
nice names such as David Harvey uh Neil

2779
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:20,119
Smith

2780
02:10:20,119 --> 02:10:23,340
those were kind of a period with a lot

2781
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:25,739
of change we have social mobility of the

2782
02:10:25,739 --> 02:10:28,199
working class in 1970s

2783
02:10:28,199 --> 02:10:31,260
um feminist geographies uh that also

2784
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:33,599
emerged at this point

2785
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:36,599
um questioning male-dominated views

2786
02:10:36,599 --> 02:10:38,820
um on society

2787
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:41,880
Etc so thinking about placing geography

2788
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:45,060
relating it to process of of

2789
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:47,760
um of capitalism

2790
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:51,119
the other big strands you could say

2791
02:10:51,119 --> 02:10:51,659
um

2792
02:10:51,659 --> 02:10:53,960
there's more you could say a humanist

2793
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:56,820
humanistic geography that thinks about

2794
02:10:56,820 --> 02:11:00,360
urban lifestyles Urban behaviors Urban

2795
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:04,260
cultures which less kind of relates

2796
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:08,060
itself to uh to capitalism uh in a sense

2797
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:10,980
but really starts with okay what kind of

2798
02:11:10,980 --> 02:11:14,099
forces haven't we heard in the city how

2799
02:11:14,099 --> 02:11:16,619
are cities being experienced can we

2800
02:11:16,619 --> 02:11:18,719
think about the power of representation

2801
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:20,400
how different spaces are being

2802
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,560
represented what the power of discourses

2803
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,780
is it's not just about material

2804
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:26,460
circumstances also how we think about

2805
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:28,920
certain places that will explain what

2806
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:30,119
takes place

2807
02:11:30,119 --> 02:11:32,340
and also a shift towards more insane

2808
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:34,320
qualitative methods

2809
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,360
um that kind of simplifies the cultural

2810
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:39,420
turn uh more widely okay

2811
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:41,099
and this is not at the end of a

2812
02:11:41,099 --> 02:11:42,840
conversation I would say and that's kind

2813
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:45,420
of the abundance of further studies

2814
02:11:45,420 --> 02:11:48,719
uh more widely and Robin particular that

2815
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:50,400
all these different approaches exist

2816
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,619
next to one another but you have to kind

2817
02:11:52,619 --> 02:11:55,260
of be aware that they work in different

2818
02:11:55,260 --> 02:11:57,119
kind of traditions and then we'll

2819
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,639
formulate questions in a particular way

2820
02:11:59,639 --> 02:12:02,699
and I think you will see returning here

2821
02:12:02,699 --> 02:12:04,560
and there throughout the course somebody

2822
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:06,420
who works perhaps a little bit more in

2823
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:08,159
that framework or starts to refer to

2824
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:10,139
that tradition and it's something to be

2825
02:12:10,139 --> 02:12:11,940
aware of I can't do justice to the

2826
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:14,060
history of geography in three slides

2827
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:17,880
that would be over the top but it's

2828
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:19,619
something to think about

2829
02:12:19,619 --> 02:12:21,900
okay I'll end there sorry for taking a

2830
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:24,840
little bit longer by next week please

2831
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:27,540
try to get over these two texts

2832
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:30,239
um or share it with your colleagues and

2833
02:12:30,239 --> 02:12:32,760
the world city hypothesis by John

2834
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:36,239
Friedman and ALDI and uh somewhat less

2835
02:12:36,239 --> 02:12:39,719
old but still already investigated uh

2836
02:12:39,719 --> 02:12:42,920
text by saskia

2837
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:49,460
mixed with muscles

2838
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:51,179
all right

2839
02:12:51,179 --> 02:12:54,480
thank you very much

2840
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:57,860
um and see you next week

2841
02:12:59,690 --> 02:13:02,740
[Music]



# 2 Theories of world-city formation

1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,000
[Music]

2
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,380
thank you

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,820
welcome everybody good evening

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,820
welcome to the second session

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,980
off Urban

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,500
social geography

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,340
uh thanks for being here uh despite the

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,800
live stream and the recording

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,920
I think it really makes sense to be here

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,700
um

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,559
so we can have a bit of an interactive

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,840
session

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,920
um

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,680
how did you arrive in Brussels first

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,760
week

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,000
everything going okay yeah

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,079
yeah okay you're Landing still a little

18
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:01,920
bit

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,019
yeah

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,020
um how did you find the stuff so long

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,760
for for those attending

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,560
did somebody attacks it's not so long

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,720
yeah

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,700
they don't live up to your expectations

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,500
more or less

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,560
yeah

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,540
did you find it weird that I started

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,320
with uh over 50 of the urban population

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,540
lives in cities that this was on the

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,680
first slide okay yeah we didn't have a

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,060
deal that she would put that on there

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,340
but

33
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,159
I can see your critical Minds

34
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,900
deconstructing that first slide so that

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,979
um

36
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,520
yeah we have our answers here ready okay

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,280
uh today we'll be talking about you

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,860
could say an important chunk of of

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,020
research into urban uh urban geography

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,119
um most about geographers yes

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,880
they haven't no last week that

42
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,979
yeah it didn't work

43
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,119
um

44
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,360
yeah you remember yes okay as well no

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,660
the system doesn't work I'm not sure why

46
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,239
um but I have a singing voice so I'll

47
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,900
try to project my ideas

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,300
um and if you don't hear it I can do it

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,120
if it's higher or louder

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
um but maybe we should be a little bit

51
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,099
quieter than that will help as well so

52
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,440
world cities Global cities one of the

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,239
big debates I think in urban geography

54
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,340
in urban studies more widely

55
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,220
uh it's also a very long-standing debate

56
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,459
uh going back to at least the 80s which

57
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,980
probably also explains why you had to

58
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,239
read old stuff uh that you may or may

59
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,480
not find outdated uh I hope it's not

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,760
outdated they're all texts but I think

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,319
they're still relevant in one way or

62
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,780
another and we'll also try to discuss

63
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,819
that a little bit now what's the

64
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,300
structure of today there's three main uh

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,959
Parts uh this lecture

66
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,420
first of all we're going to discuss

67
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,459
I I mean very generally the centrality

68
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,260
of cities and city regions in the global

69
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,360
economy and will take you through three

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,940
uh complementary views or views that

71
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,860
built on one another by John Friedman

72
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,739
Sasuke assassin and Alan Scott

73
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,780
secondly uh so that's kind of a

74
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,340
conceptual theoretical discussion

75
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,200
secondly we'll have more of a

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,659
methodological discussion which deals

77
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,319
with how uh given these Concepts how we

78
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,300
can actually measure and say something

79
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,299
empirical about world cities and Global

80
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,140
cities

81
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,599
and one of the main methodologies there

82
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,780
is the methodology by gork which is the

83
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,060
globalization of world cities research

84
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,879
Network which was founded somewhere in

85
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,159
the 1990s by Peter Taylor and has been

86
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,099
one of the main you could say empirical

87
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,140
methodological uh contributions to the

88
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,319
debate from that period

89
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,799
and then third of all as we'll learn

90
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,080
um there was some kind of a dominance

91
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,780
if you will in this area of cities and

92
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,399
globalization

93
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,820
um and there as a dominant voice there

94
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,000
is also quite a bit of uh friendly and

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,380
unfriendly critique criticism uh toward

96
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,259
um this particular framing of of global

97
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,900
City and world city formation and I

98
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,300
think going into these debates is

99
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,100
actually quite telling

100
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,520
um as to how we Define uh world and

101
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,040
Global cities uh where we think that

102
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,440
that criticism is Justified where it's

103
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,540
Perhaps Perhaps less just a fight where

104
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,220
it deals with other kind of issues and

105
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,440
I'll be talking about four of those

106
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,440
points of criticism one you could call

107
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,900
the both Colonial critique a social

108
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,540
constructivist critique people that talk

109
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,759
about State rescaling and the role of

110
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,040
the state and then finally

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,320
um some Brilliant Minds that had

112
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,660
something to say about financialization

113
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,540
okay and that may alter a reading of

114
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,880
what actually happens in world and

115
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,960
Global cities

116
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,780
but before we start

117
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,500
my question to you uh why are cities

118
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,800
Central in the global economy and what

119
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,020
would it mean to say that cities are

120
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,300
actually powerful economically powerful

121
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,340
take a minute uh talk to your neighbor

122
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,900
uh right time a few notes and think

123
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,820
about what your answer could be go ahead

124
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:52,020

[Music]

130
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,539
thank you guys

131
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,120
okay first ideas are the most creative

132
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,160
ones

133
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,960
uh yeah

134
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,300
so how are cities Central in the global

135
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,699
economy and why oh how can we see that

136
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,300
they're powerful

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,419
is he the burning hand

138
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,940
become those centers of

139
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,400
um markets and of multinational

140
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,160
companies and that's why it gets more

141
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
and more power sometimes even more than

142
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,440
the nation states that are updated

143
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,780
because they become the part of this

144
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,759
International network of those

145
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,160
pharmaceutical cities

146
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,699
and on the other hand it's like most of

147
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,000
the innovativeness most of the capital

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,120
um like mostly not Material these days

149
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,900
but also like social capital is placed

150
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,660
in those big cities and that's why like

151
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,260
you you kind of have this uh point of

152
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,080
migration of high professional stores

153
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,640
okay thank you so it's something that

154
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,880
these are the seats of corporate power

155
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,680
and perhaps the elite that buzz around

156
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,120
those corporations okay other ideas

157
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,670

[Music]

160
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,920
yeah

161
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
um

162
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,420
for example

163
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,959
yeah

164
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,820
okay so not just economic processes but

165
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,640
also the power of people and ideas

166
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,040
cultures diversity okay other ideas

167
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,140
yes I guess it helps out to that but we

168
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,060
we're talking about flows because this

169
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,800
is

170
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
true that all these flows come together

171
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,940
in large cities and then it becomes more

172
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,040
than it goes from this large city to

173
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,140
another large city and kind of

174
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,560
goes further than the national level

175
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,940
instead of going from the north city to

176
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,860
the the other parts of the country

177
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,399
because it moves between cities

178
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,620
and what is the the substance of these

179
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,660
flows it can be anything like for money

180
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,160
to knowledge to people

181
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,779
Commodities as well

182
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,600
okay other ideas yeah we were talking

183
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,560
about

184
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,220
um just like cities like city government

185
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,740
uh often have you know controlled daily

186
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,339
life budget and make cool side effects

187
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,380
you know a large number of people

188
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,720
quality

189
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,519
it's kind of the Benjamin Barber

190
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,980
argument what if Mayors ruled the world

191
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,680
there's a lot of in a lot of contexts

192
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,899
you could say the main economic centers

193
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,180
are also important political centers and

194
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,380
the national economy and National

195
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,720
politics and it seems to be also that

196
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,980
there's some kind of an extra

197
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,320
territorial supranational Authority

198
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,660
there as well okay thanks for your

199
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,060
answers I think there's other options to

200
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,380
talk about but

201
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,839
I think you already uh got to some of

202
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,700
the essential points what I'm going to

203
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,519
show you it's a bit of a a dated list of

204
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,860
figures but just to give a little bit of

205
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,399
of exhibits as to how important in

206
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,680
economic terms then and perhaps also

207
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,420
like the political terms

208
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,880
some world cities or world city regions

209
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,339
or Global city regions are this is a

210
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,600
list and this is research by a certain

211
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,540
man named lombrex from the early

212
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,660
Northeast and he compared the main you

213
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,940
could say leading metropolitan areas in

214
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,660
in Western Europe so it's by no means an

215
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,940
international comparison at a global

216
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,700
scale but it's comparing

217
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,760
um Delta Metropolis this is basically

218
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,339
Amsterdam rottenham the Hague Etc the

219
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,800
Flemish Diamond which is roughly

220
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,620
speaking against Antwerp Northern

221
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,620
uh Brussels uh which is kind of the

222
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,420
economic Heartland if you still remember

223
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,720
in Belgium

224
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
which is Western Germany kind of old

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,459
industrial area which is a a large

226
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,040
conversation with a lot of industrial uh

227
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,740
activity or at least it used to be

228
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,959
France this is basically greater Paris

229
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,300
and then greater London is greater

230
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,880
London okay so comparing these five

231
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,980
areas on a number of characteristics and

232
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,959
you'll also see the NX figures what he

233
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,140
kind of finds is that these region city

234
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,420
regions metropolitan areas are bunching

235
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,120
above their weight if you compare the

236
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,880
share in a national surface so the size

237
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,300
in terms of built-up structure depending

238
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,459
the complete territory

239
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,680
it's actually quite small

240
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,320
um when you compare that to figures in

241
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,079
population

242
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,940
these largely outweigh the share in

243
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,920
national territory and then when you

244
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,760
look at the share of these areas in GDP

245
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,279
which is kind of the value total value

246
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,579
of all economic transactions which is a

247
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,980
flawed measure in many ways but it's one

248
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,200
way of starting to compare National

249
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,399
economies we see that that these areas

250
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,139
actually punch above their weight so for

251
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,540
instance when you look at the Flemish

252
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,339
Diamond to take the Belgian example 30

253
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,399
of national service 52 of the population

254
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,880
lives there but 63 of all economic

255
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,060
activities uh actually take place there

256
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,720
um

257
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,880
more striking figures are even there for

258
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,700
uh for Paris and London only one and two

259
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,120
percent off uh of the territory uh about

260
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,360
we could say one-tenth to one one-fifth

261
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,000
of the population but in terms of

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,639
um of economic power especially for the

263
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,700
case of Paris it's it's way bigger than

264
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,339
you would anticipate okay so a large

265
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,740
um agglomeration and concentration of we

266
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,839
could say economic transactions that is

267
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,940
taking place

268
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,279
it also means that a lot of these places

269
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,740
tend to be richer

270
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,320
um than their Hinterlands okay so it's

271
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,959
kind of a runaway process it's something

272
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,519
with these activities that are taking

273
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,920
place there that generates more wealth

274
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,860
per capita so this is GDP per head so

275
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,200
you divide the value of economic

276
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,260
activities by the total population in uh

277
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,560
in that City so typically uh these

278
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,959
places are richer than

279
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,260
European average and also compared to

280
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,079
the rest of the economy in that sense

281
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,600
when you look at Brussels Brussels is

282
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,899
you could say the richest city uh in

283
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,420
Belgium

284
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,760
in principle richer than the rest of

285
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,100
Belgium but as as we discussed last week

286
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,480
there's a lot of this wealth actually

287
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,639
leaking to the periphery which is

288
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,880
actually in Flawless and bologna so it

289
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,800
doesn't really show when you look at at

290
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,600
figures from the Press of Capital Region

291
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,260
but the same would actually apply okay

292
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,480
um another way of looking at it is yeah

293
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,399
and this was kind of referred to by it's

294
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,620
a concentration also of ideas Innovation

295
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,540
people

296
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,459
um it's very difficult to measure that

297
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,279
one way of doing that is is looking at

298
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,459
patents right which is a kind of

299
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:10,620
certification legal certification that

300
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,079
something has been invented in one area

301
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,139
or another a coveted vaccine uh some

302
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,680
kind of a chip an algorithm whatever and

303
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,959
it has intellectual property on it so

304
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,760
and it can be commercialized in one way

305
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,139
or another but it's a very you could say

306
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,740
oh stock exposed kind of measurement of

307
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,519
of places and their their a measure of

308
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,620
innovation but it's a way to compare

309
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,540
different areas and what you see is that

310
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,779
uh here it's a bit more mixed

311
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:43,320
um if you for instance in in France you

312
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,560
see that uh that Paris is actually uh

313
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,899
outperforming the rest of of the country

314
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,260
this is far less the case in the UK but

315
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,360
it is the case in uh for instance the

316
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,820
Flemish dark okay so it's a bit more of

317
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,420
a but mixed picture but we see that in

318
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,639
general there's a tendency to locate you

319
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,740
could say Innovative processes as

320
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,260
evidence to battles okay there's a lot

321
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,660
of innovation that is not being measured

322
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,480
here no social Innovation for instance

323
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,360
it's really linked to Technologies uh

324
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,220
high-end services and these countries

325
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,360
okay

326
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,480
when you look at the the structure

327
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,839
of the labor markets uh you see that

328
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,440
typically metropolitan areas is also

329
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,459
show a higher share of Highly Educated

330
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:35,399
uh Highly Educated work okay so

331
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,980
substantially bigger

332
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,240
um say like

333
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,600
say in the Delta Metropolis it's 30

334
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,540
percent of uh Highly Educated people

335
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,300
compared to more or less 20 percent of

336
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,160
the rest of them in Netherlands and you

337
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,339
can have a look at the other cities to

338
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,620
see how it fares okay so a different

339
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,959
kind of Labor Market structure which

340
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,699
tells us something about the kinds of

341
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,139
activities that are probably taking

342
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,639
place there

343
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,900
uh and another indicator there is when

344
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,959
you look at the employment uh figures

345
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,679
across different kinds of sectors so

346
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,599
there's the in the three sector model

347
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,559
that's agriculture industry and services

348
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,720
and we see that well obviously uh

349
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,880
agriculture is very small but that's a

350
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,179
constant everywhere but that there's a

351
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,260
significant larger share in services in

352
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,020
these metropolitan areas than in the

353
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,900
rest of okay so it's there's these are

354
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,460
places that are not marked by industry

355
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,240
but by service economies

356
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,640
so these are just the number of exhibits

357
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,679
uh that tell you something about the

358
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,360
economic importance but it doesn't

359
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,480
really tell you why these places are

360
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,700
important it's just kind of a hint that

361
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,799
something is going on there and actually

362
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,340
you already mentioned quite a few ideas

363
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,280
of how we can theorize the centrality or

364
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,080
at least conceptualize the centrality

365
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,380
and Power in off cities in the global

366
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,640
economy one of the main text uh that is

367
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,039
in the reader for this week

368
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,919
was this world city hypothesis by by

369
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,140
John you've rolled Reddit

370
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,140
so you can just interrupt me if you want

371
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,299
to interject something

372
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,980
um but I just want to give you a number

373
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,400
of notes of my personal notes on on uh

374
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,679
what John Friedman was actually writing

375
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,820
about

376
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,360
so a bit of context to this uh to this

377
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,480
thesis or hypothesis it's a hypothesis

378
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,980
that

379
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,799
groups a number of observations from the

380
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,559
1980s tries to come up with a bit of a

381
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,220
research agenda that needs uh empirical

382
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,860
testing right but you need to understand

383
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,280
a bit more of this context of the 1980s

384
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,919
people of my age have to have the habit

385
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,380
of starting history in the 1980s because

386
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,480
it was the decade they were born if I

387
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,160
was 10 years older I was probably going

388
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,400
to refer the 1970s but as a toddler this

389
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
was my my context right so

390
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,320
um you have to remember that in the

391
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,320
1980s this was this emerging kind of

392
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,020
idea that we would experience the end of

393
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,600
the city right uh it was the rise of uh

394
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,919
information and communication technology

395
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,220
on a very Democratic large scale uh not

396
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,840
yet the internet but that was emerging

397
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,179
in the 1990s and being democratized

398
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,900
cheap mass transportation it became very

399
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,539
cheap to fly around the world

400
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,240
um shipping became something that was

401
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,760
very affordable

402
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,860
and what we kind of see is a complete

403
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,380
restructuring of the economy this kind

404
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,520
of reaching its high day in the 1980s it

405
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,340
was already going on in the 60s and 70s

406
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,160
but by the 1980s what became obvious is

407
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,280
that we we are in a new situation

408
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,320
which would call the new international

409
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,980
division of labor with new kinds of uh

410
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,559
geographies of production much more to

411
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,440
the the global east uh and far less

412
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,320
centered on the old industrial areas in

413
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,600
uh say European and America what we've

414
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,780
been discussing last week and we see uh

415
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,780
that this new centrality of cities need

416
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,360
theorizing if cities are not the places

417
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,840
where a lot of goods are produced and

418
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,940
hence where you get some kind of a trade

419
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,100
surplus when you start trading these

420
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,440
Commodities say textiles Etc with other

421
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,240
places in the world what is then the

422
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,400
kind of source of power that cities

423
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,080
actually hold okay

424
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,179
and what John Friedman comes up with is

425
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,100
say look to answer this question we have

426
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,780
to look at how cities are actually being

427
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,020
inserted and indeed an urban system that

428
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,660
is not only National but as Supra

429
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,100
National is actually a global Urban

430
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,059
system

431
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,919
you have to understand that in mostly in

432
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,200
the 1970s a lot of the tradition in

433
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,660
urban geography was looking at Urban

434
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,720
systems in a very nationalist way it was

435
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,000
methodological nationalism it was

436
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,799
looking at Argentina you have Buenos

437
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,080
Aires which was the Central City and

438
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,539
then you had a number of smaller towns

439
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,340
uh but there was a huge configuration

440
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,220
there uh and it left to some it left to

441
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,620
some blind spot as to what actually the

442
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,720
position of these cities were and

443
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,940
processes that went beyond National

444
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,880
economies and as these processes became

445
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,679
ever more prominent

446
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,740
it requested a huge uh you could say

447
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,679
conceptual Innovation uh that started to

448
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,919
emerge in the 1970s hence the importance

449
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,900
of Regents

450
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,179
um theorizing conceptualizing about

451
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,200
world city so a global Urban system

452
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,179
and the kind of main underlying

453
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,679
hypothesis sorry yes

454
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,860
so the last part what I was saying is

455
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,980
that you have processes of globalization

456
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,200
which means that the way that Urban

457
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,480
geographers were looking at Urban

458
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,780
systems became obsolete in one way or

459
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,600
another they were mostly linked to how

460
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,360
economies were functioning at the

461
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,620
national scale

462
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,200
uh looking into let's say where

463
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,059
productive activities were located how

464
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,220
commuter flows were organized how

465
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,559
Capital float etc etc

466
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,960
but as an increased share of the economy

467
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,559
became you could say International or

468
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,000
transnational

469
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,919
yes the first thing that needed to

470
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,480
happen was some kind of a conceptual

471
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,760
framework or apparatus that allowed to

472
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,320
understand centrality at a different

473
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,340
level

474
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,500
but differently instead of talking about

475
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,419
National Urban systems people started

476
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:47,580
talking about global Urban systems all

477
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,440
right

478
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,559
but looking at centralities okay so what

479
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,740
Freedom kind of uh started to to argue

480
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,780
also on the basis of his reading of

481
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,600
David Harvey in 1970s on Manuel castells

482
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,820
is that we can only understand what goes

483
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,980
on in cities if we relate that to the

484
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,620
position of these places in This Global

485
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,179
Urban system so it's the kind of their

486
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,400
function that they take in the global

487
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,380
economy or rather in This Global Urban

488
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,140
system that will help to explain what we

489
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,159
find in certain places

490
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
turned around on the other side of that

491
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,179
coin is that this Global Urban system or

492
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,580
this global economy can also be in part

493
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,280
explained through what is going on in

494
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,799
key Global cities or in this case world

495
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,440
cities to use the terminology so it's

496
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,240
the processes that emerge and are

497
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,700
steered and controlled from these places

498
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,179
that will have an impact on them larger

499
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,820
macro processes in the global economy

500
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,820
so that's kind of this dialectic global

501
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,299
system macro level Global Urban system

502
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:53,720
world cities and they're kind of

503
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,900
co-productive or co-constitutive right

504
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,360
so one of I mean one of the main

505
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,640
excerpts or key answer excerpts there

506
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
from this world city hypothesis which is

507
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,539
kind of very poignant is

508
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:07,919
um key cities throughout the world are

509
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,080
used by global Capital as basing points

510
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,580
in the spatial organization and

511
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,860
articulation of production and markets

512
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,480
the resulting linkages make it possible

513
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,880
to arrange a world world cities and into

514
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,460
a complex spatial hierarchy so it's

515
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,559
about appreciating how indeed capital

516
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,620
is and its actors

517
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,380
is kind of basing itself in cities as

518
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,960
they organize Global Production

519
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,620
and uh commercial activities okay so

520
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,720
that was kind of the main focus and if

521
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,179
we understand that we will start

522
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,520
explaining why certain places are

523
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,820
important and others less and why some

524
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,460
cities are dependent in this process and

525
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,419
why others are actually powerful

526
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,580
so yeah as I said it's a period of

527
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,520
geo-economic restructuring uh the loss

528
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,039
of a lot of functions uh that were

529
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,860
typically taking place in cities and I

530
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,960
mean John Friedman was was writing from

531
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,679
Los Angeles which was a very

532
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,620
production-centered uh town or city and

533
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,659
it was losing functions and what he

534
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,200
observed was still a huge concentration

535
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,900
of skyscrapers

536
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,779
and corporate headquarters but

537
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,760
production had long left

538
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,279
so this kind of conundrum was how do we

539
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,159
explain that how do we make sense

540
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,400
and indeed as I've been explaining you

541
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,840
had this emergence of the new

542
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,220
international division of labor

543
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,400
activities that were being offshored to

544
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,580
other parts of the globe and the

545
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,279
emergence of a new set of Enterprises

546
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,880
corporations multinational corporations

547
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,220
if you could say an American firm would

548
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,559
be globalizing or multinational

549
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:58,080
corporations where it was actually kind

550
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,240
of hard to still identify to what extent

551
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,380
they were still connected to some

552
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,820
territory yes

553
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,220
when you say that the production

554
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,860
activity has long left

555
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,440
what is the exactly these credential

556
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,539
activities I mean I this was the

557
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,700
question when I was reading the text

558
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,700
yeah I mean obviously it would depend on

559
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,279
the city that we're talking about uh but

560
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,799
think about uh what happened in cities

561
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,340
like Brussels I mean textile industry

562
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,400
um all kinds of of production facilities

563
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,580
for consumer goods that were initially

564
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,860
uh I mean think about washing machines

565
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,440
uh you know everything that you use in

566
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,000
the kitchen

567
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,700
um these were typically produced in the

568
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,580
post-war era in you could say the high

569
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,159
income industrialized countries

570
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,980
but because there was you could say

571
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,140
pressure on the profitability of these

572
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,120
activities because the wages were rather

573
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,620
High

574
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,919
these activities were offshore by

575
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,059
emotional multinational corporations and

576
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,820
one of the main motivations was the

577
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,000
search for for lower wages okay or you

578
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,320
could say less regulated labor markets

579
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,200
uh than than what was occurring in say

580
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,940
the traditional industrial areas yes

581
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:45,179
yes yeah I mean yeah indeed I mean and

582
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,580
this sometimes a little bit of confusion

583
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,059
there because people sometimes say okay

584
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:53,159
these industrial activities uh shifted

585
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,440
to the periphery so I think in the first

586
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,659
instance is the initial periphery of the

587
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,520
city I mean the whole year the suburbs

588
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,679
but I think even and it had something to

589
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,020
do with you could say more the urban

590
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,659
geographies the land Trends uh the

591
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,600
ground prices in cities because it's I

592
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,580
mean you need large surfaces and it's

593
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,640
easier to organize peripheries but then

594
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,400
at the later stage they would basically

595
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,380
uh I mean these activities were Cuts

596
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,960
because of investment in technology and

597
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,659
because you needed Less jobs

598
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:27,179
to make the same products and or there

599
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,059
were shifted to other places around the

600
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,580
globe okay so but this is kind of

601
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,980
I mean what what started to occur I mean

602
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,779
some people even in some Industries it

603
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,940
was already in the 1950s it's a kind of

604
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,140
this

605
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,419
and over a day

606
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,880
but it culminated if you will in the 70s

607
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,980
and then the early 80s which was a

608
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,020
period of crisis in a lot of cities

609
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,760
so yeah this new type of corporate actor

610
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,860
multinational corporations transnational

611
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,679
corporations uh and how they organize

612
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,320
Global production networks so a

613
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,000
production Network that used to be kind

614
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,580
of regionalized or nationalized in one

615
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,440
way or another

616
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,960
um relied on local suppliers ended up

617
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,779
being Global I mean if you have tried to

618
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,720
order a bike in the past one year you

619
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,120
know what it means to depend on Global

620
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Supply chains or production networks

621
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,220
it's just

622
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,380
an intensely fine-tuned process if

623
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,240
anything goes wrong

624
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,940
I don't know a tanker blocking

625
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,179
um the Suez Canal or something

626
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:34,500
uh it's a precarious situation but

627
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,899
that's the kind of reality Global Supply

628
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,360
chains and it's a part of the economy

629
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,919
that's extremely dominated by these

630
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:42,480
multinational corporations just some

631
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,299
figures I mean there's a timeline there

632
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:49,140
1960s was about 66 billion what was kind

633
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,600
of uh foreign direct investment

634
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,700
sorry for the technical terms the terms

635
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,140
here but it means

636
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,260
um direct investment in setting up

637
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,419
um factories so you build a plant

638
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,679
somewhere else

639
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,580
so like uh Mercedes-Benz built a plant

640
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,620
in Korea or something I'm not sure if

641
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,640
they did

642
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,000
our Toyota builds a plant in in Texas

643
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,620
and it's kind of foreign direct

644
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,440
investment logic and it boomed basically

645
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,260
and you look at the figures of 2016

646
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,760
um I could update that I should probably

647
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,220
do that about a third of the global

648
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,559
economy is actually

649
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:31,100
um equivalent to these FDI figures yes

650
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,740
foreign direct investment

651
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,779
it's not too important but you just have

652
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,840
to understand that this is a measure of

653
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,320
transnational flows so it's a measure of

654
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,340
uh what part of the economy is

655
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,440
um not local but it's actually Global or

656
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,640
transnational

657
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,820
and it relates to uh the investment

658
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,240
activities by large corporations

659
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,340
to set up

660
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,799
Greenfield Investments out of this goal

661
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,620
so imagine a green field where you put a

662
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,020
new Factory or some such thing as

663
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,880
Brownfield Redevelopment which is an x x

664
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,340
site which is then a refurbish or one

665
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,419
way or another

666
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,940
okay so these are those kind of

667
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,419
activities so 90 of this global economy

668
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:25,140
uh of this FDI is concentrated in these

669
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,659
multinational corporations and slowly

670
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,580
getting to my point here this is also

671
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,340
why John Friedman was looking at

672
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,679
multinational corporations and their

673
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:37,080
geographies to identify and

674
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,360
conceptualize uh world cities so for

675
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,480
John Friedman Friedman it were the

676
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,340
cities where a lot of these headquarters

677
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,279
buy is an international corporations uh

678
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,580
we're located we're uh I mean those were

679
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,860
those cities that he identified as World

680
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,960
Series Okay so

681
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,580
since they're so important in the

682
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,080
globally okay

683
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,600
so as he says world cities are then uh

684
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,919
to be uh sites for command and control

685
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,299
and he really saw these corporate

686
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,580
headquarters as the places that controls

687
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,520
and command it in various ways either

688
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,220
through governance systems by decision

689
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,460
making by their internal structure uh

690
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,020
how Global Production was being

691
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,100
organized okay and it's kind of

692
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,220
methodological hypothesis was if we map

693
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,340
uh these headquarter geographies

694
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,980
we will actually be able to to map the

695
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,200
global Urban system and we'll also

696
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,299
understand the relation between

697
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:39,659
different kind of cities uh as to who

698
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,960
controls what and so it's a way to to

699
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,520
look at Power in This Global Urban

700
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,120
Network some places are more dominant

701
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,799
hold more command and control functions

702
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,140
than others okay so and then he came up

703
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,580
with this um

704
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,860
with this map or art program or whatever

705
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,720
you want to call it

706
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,059
um yeah it's certainly dated because

707
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,580
Soviet Union is still on there and it's

708
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,299
not gonna not part of this figure which

709
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,720
is also debatable maybe they were not uh

710
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,360
I mean you could say euro-american

711
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,000
corporate headquarters there but for

712
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,039
sure there were links uh even with

713
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,980
between the Soviet Union and capitalist

714
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,919
countries for sure but the whole point

715
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,899
is that what what Friedman actually does

716
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,299
here is Translate

717
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,059
uh the critical tradition of world

718
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,000
systems theory which is a way to explain

719
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,640
uneven development in the global economy

720
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,700
to an urban framework so identifies

721
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,640
three kind of areas globalization Arenas

722
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,880
if you will one centered on Asia one on

723
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,380
Northern America and one on Western

724
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,500
Europe and typically he kind of finds a

725
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,240
Power Balance where you you have

726
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,340
powerful cities with a lot of corporate

727
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,980
headquarters uh and you could say the

728
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,620
northern part of the hemisphere and more

729
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,980
you could say subordinate roles for

730
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,260
countries in the global South so when

731
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,880
you for instance look at Northern

732
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,300
America you have Los Angeles Chicago and

733
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,280
New York which are identified as core

734
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,379
cities with a lot of headquarters and

735
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:14,659
they're kind of

736
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,520
organizational networks threats to the

737
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,800
global periphery so there's connections

738
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,839
with Rio de Janeiro for instance Buenos

739
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,080
Aires and these are kind of

740
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,239
semi-peripheral cities who

741
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,760
also hold command and control functions

742
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,280
and headquarters that are oriented

743
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,460
towards these centers in the global

744
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,440
North could be that there are

745
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,080
subsidiaries of large corporations that

746
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,899
are organized their setup Etc so it's a

747
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,940
way to explain how power is distributed

748
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,280
in This Global Urban system and also

749
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,379
starts to explain why

750
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,500
perhaps some places benefit more from

751
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,359
this integration in the global Urban

752
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,540
system than others so it would probably

753
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,240
lead to an accumulation of wealth in

754
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,400
cities in the global North

755
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,440
to some extent also in the

756
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,060
semi-periphery think about Uria de

757
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,980
Janeiro but at the same time it would

758
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,520
also work as some kind of a funnel of uh

759
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,640
to siphon off a siphon actually of

760
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,800
surplus towards the global North

761
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,820
for instance uh a U.S corporation

762
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,280
producing stuff in Argentina

763
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,560
um in part there will be benefits

764
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,780
locally but at the same time there will

765
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,720
also be an extraction of surplus value

766
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,060
to the global North okay so it's also a

767
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,119
way to understand

768
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,940
unevenness in this global economy

769
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,160
I know it's a lot sometimes a lot of

770
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,800
economic terms but just to give you an

771
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,500
idea a restructured global economy and

772
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,480
the imaginary of a global Urban system

773
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,900
and cities taking a different role uh in

774
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,540
that on the basis of their command and

775
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,900
control functions which treatment

776
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,960
defines as headquarter functions

777
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,440
so that's world cities world cities

778
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,880
corporate headquarters command and

779
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,640
control I'm just giving you a number of

780
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,740
key Concepts there

781
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,859
a second way of theorizing it is and

782
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,960
that's why I also had the other texts I

783
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,180
could have given you the entire book the

784
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,300
global City but it would have taken you

785
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,280
uh a week probably or at least a few

786
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,140
days to actually read it you're still

787
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,079
invited to do so but it's a kind of a a

788
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,480
shorter uh kind of version of the

789
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,180
argument which kind of explains what

790
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,720
centrality is uh to Sasuke assassin okay

791
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,520
um but I'll give you a bit more context

792
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,160
by by referring also to her book the

793
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,339
global City so one of you could say what

794
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,320
is being argued to be one of the seminal

795
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,540
pieces talking about cities and

796
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,780
globalization it starts kind of from the

797
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,720
same route as Friedman I mean it had

798
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,760
been a very intense conversation in the

799
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,579
1980s about yeah what is going on with

800
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,680
cities they have shifting functions

801
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,540
they're faced with the industrialization

802
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,599
etc etc there's also a fiscal crisis of

803
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,060
the local state a lot of cities were in

804
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,540
trouble if you you saw the movie Taxi

805
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,520
Driver with the young Robert De Niro

806
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,900
he's uh he's driving around the Relic

807
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,820
New York in the city neighborhoods are

808
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,579
in trouble there's a lot of blight

809
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:26,040
um so cities were struggling to think

810
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,859
about what their functions could be and

811
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,859
what is going on especially in 1970s is

812
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,079
a complete restructuring of these Urban

813
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,800
economies so for assassin it's less only

814
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,720
about you could say new command and

815
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,880
Control Function about headquarters she

816
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,619
looks at the complete restructuring of

817
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,599
urban economies from you could say

818
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,220
manufacturing jobs to service economies

819
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,339
so we already saw that the majority of

820
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,680
economic activities in metropolitan

821
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,540
areas of our services but she

822
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,940
particularly focuses on on a particular

823
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,020
subset

824
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,200
of these Services which of course

825
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,420
Advanced producer services

826
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,460
so in the coming months you will

827
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,500
probably start to hate the notion of

828
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,200
advanced producer services or be

829
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,560
intrigued by it but it's a kind of I

830
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
mean you probably never heard about it

831
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,820
and neither did I before I ever read

832
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,060
about it but it tells it's it's kind of

833
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,660
um

834
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,060
trying to capture those very

835
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,280
sophisticated if you will Professional

836
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,339
Services that serve as inputs for other

837
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:35,460
firms so in in themselves they don't

838
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,320
really produce much

839
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,540
but still their input is very important

840
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,400
for other corporations

841
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,520
think about financial services

842
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,520
law management consultancy accounting

843
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,000
and auditing advertising etc etc so

844
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,140
these are not really producing things

845
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,240
that you can then buy and consume at

846
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,339
some point

847
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:00,540
this is actually very knowledge

848
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,640
intensive sometimes it's also called

849
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,579
knowledge intensive Business Services

850
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:07,619
which are kind of consumed as they are

851
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,800
produced so legal advice it's kind of

852
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,980
produced in in face-to-face meetings

853
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,940
think about a corporation that wants to

854
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,760
set up a shop or a plant or an

855
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,760
investment in China a European firm

856
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,000
probably you want to check a thing or

857
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,859
two with a large international law firm

858
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:35,760
that can give you a lot of experience as

859
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,980
to what the regulations are for I don't

860
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,099
know investment and ownership in China

861
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:42,660
um you would need

862
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,740
dedicated Financial Services how do you

863
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,579
finance uh your International expansion

864
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:52,140
you would need

865
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,180
um the advice of auditing firms

866
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,579
accounting firms because probably you

867
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,560
want to attract some further funding by

868
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,380
issuing I don't know stocks or bonds or

869
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,420
something like that so Financial

870
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,760
investors would want to look at at your

871
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,100
activities

872
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,740
[Music]

873
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,599
um

874
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,980
advertising yes how are you going to

875
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,420
sell your cookies cars Etc in China

876
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,859
um you need to know something about

877
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:19,800
about the local market or local markets

878
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,839
the sensitivities

879
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,599
um so yeah you may want to adapt your

880
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,880
practices there you may need the advice

881
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,460
of management Consultants because you

882
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,200
may say that you want to globalize but

883
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,240
how are you going to manage this process

884
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,400
what kind of responsibilities do you

885
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,619
give to your managers in China do they

886
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,200
have autonomy to take decisions

887
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,380
uh will you work with uh with the

888
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,540
central command structure how will you

889
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,520
think about the profit profitability of

890
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,220
your activities etc etc I mean it's not

891
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,280
a course in um in business studies here

892
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,920
but just imagine as a firm that you want

893
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,200
to globalize there's a lot of things

894
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,859
that enter into the picture and probably

895
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:04,380
uh these kinds of inputs that you need

896
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,839
are so specialized as it doesn't make

897
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,060
sense uh to start producing them

898
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:13,320
yourself okay so uh you just buy a very

899
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,079
very specialized inputs you get in touch

900
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,720
with lawyers Consultants Etc they would

901
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,599
fly in charge the hell out of you and

902
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,800
then

903
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,940
um run off and maybe their advice was

904
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,820
okay so a shift to the service economy

905
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,099
but with the globalization of production

906
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,200
and the globalization of markets and

907
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,079
financial markets we see that certain uh

908
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,880
service firms are becoming increasingly

909
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,740
important and these are these Advanced

910
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,260
producer Services Services

911
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,960
given to producing firms

912
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,680
um

913
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,900
and what she says is look instead of

914
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,579
looking at

915
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:53,579
um headquarters of Corporations we best

916
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:55,460
look not at the multinational

917
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,140
multinationals themselves but we we best

918
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,960
look at where these APS firms are

919
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,040
located

920
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,260
and it's not just that they have kind of

921
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,440
cold control over global Productions

922
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,200
networks as you could imagine corporate

923
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,780
headquarters where a CEO with a big

924
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,400
cigar takes a decision of uh flashing 10

925
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,760
000 jobs in in Belgium or something it's

926
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,099
a more dilute uh diluted form of control

927
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:27,420
which he talks about it's more about the

928
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,079
control capabilities it's uh the

929
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,380
assemblage or the you could say in the

930
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,560
entire mixture of these kind of service

931
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,540
economies that allows firms that use

932
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,119
these services to exert control of the

933
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,160
global scale so multinational

934
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,560
corporations Patel look at the long

935
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,320
story story short depends on yet another

936
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,480
set of players Advanced with user

937
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,420
services to actually be able to manage

938
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,160
Global Production

939
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,280
so that's kind of her reading not just

940
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,440
corporate headquarters but look at these

941
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,280
notes of advanced uh producers

942
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,980
and the second important element that

943
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,660
she links to that and we'll talk more

944
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,819
about that next week because it's a

945
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:14,339
slightly different topic is that this

946
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:17,700
these APS economies is high-end service

947
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,660
economies also is an important engine in

948
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,880
producing polarization

949
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,220
the other kind of process that produce

950
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,060
polarized uh cities but an important

951
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,579
driver according to sussland is

952
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,720
the higher remunerated salaries stuff in

953
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,220
these kind of

954
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:38,839
um

955
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,460
activities and this will have an effect

956
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,180
on the city so it produces an outcome

957
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,160
where you have high and low skilled

958
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,900
labor forces in APS or around APS and at

959
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,060
some point it could also even lead to

960
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,520
what she calls the peripheralization of

961
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,980
the core okay so there will be a drive

962
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,700
also to to boost informal labor markets

963
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,260
uh in parts of the local aircon okay but

964
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,160
we'll talk more about that uh next okay

965
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,940
so that's her idea about global cities

966
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,119
and in the end Global cities aside from

967
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,440
the production of specialized Services

968
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,079
needed by complex organizations for

969
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,420
running a spatially diverse dispersed

970
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,220
network of factories offices and service

971
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,079
outlets and the production of financial

972
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,000
Innovations and the making of markets

973
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,920
both Central to the internationalization

974
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,260
expansion of the financial industry so

975
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,560
for assassin it's both about and you're

976
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,300
free to refer to socials because it

977
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,400
rhymes with buttons as other students

978
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,200
have done so before and make movies

979
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,880
about

980
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,980
um so it's both about global production

981
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,440
networks but also the running of global

982
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,260
financial markets so it's not just the

983
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,480
production of goods themselves but also

984
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,400
connecting to the world of Finance to

985
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,560
get investments in these production

986
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,839
models okay so that's what Sasuke

987
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:02,579
assassin is talking about

988
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:06,780
and the the Paradox that she sees is

989
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,700
um is that as there's a kind of a

990
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,280
dispersion of activities at the same

991
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,140
time there's a growing need for

992
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,720
concentration okay the more dispersed

993
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,160
Global production networks the common

994
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,619
financial markets the more the need for

995
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:21,900
centralized control or control

996
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,000
capabilities over these markets so

997
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,900
that's kind of the Paradox of cities

998
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,960
despite uh the internet Etc or

999
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,720
virtualization of activities there's a

1000
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,520
continued role

1001
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,859
um for for face-to-face interaction

1002
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,400
interpretation and limited set of cities

1003
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,880
so why are APS located in a limited

1004
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,140
number of cities

1005
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,660
well she talks about different kinds of

1006
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,119
part dependencies so it means that once

1007
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,940
a situation establishes itself it's kind

1008
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,920
of there's all kinds of cells

1009
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,380
reinforcing mechanisms

1010
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,060
so

1011
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,940
if there's a concentration there's a

1012
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,339
deep Market in services so if you go to

1013
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:06,839
London for instance you're quite sure

1014
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:09,540
that you will find everything

1015
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,359
um if you have these kind of services uh

1016
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,579
some kind of a labor market culture

1017
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:17,040
where will emerge around that you'll

1018
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,339
find a specialized labor there and yeah

1019
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:22,440
in a lot of world and Global cities

1020
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,560
think about New York uh or London some

1021
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,180
kind of a yep culture young urban

1022
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,780
professional culture has emerged within

1023
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,480
these kinds of APs firms

1024
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,579
um there's also a lot of synergies

1025
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:37,380
between these firms and I'll tell you a

1026
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,020
little bit more about that so also these

1027
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,200
different ads firms work together as

1028
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,960
they Service uh their clients

1029
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,380
and what is even more striking is that

1030
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,480
these APS firms in and of themselves

1031
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,260
also become Global corporations so they

1032
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,020
also set up International

1033
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:00,180
networks either to follow their clients

1034
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,780
or to be to remain credible as a global

1035
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,260
as a global act okay so a number of

1036
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,020
reasons why this kind of geography

1037
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,880
reproduces itself and is increasingly

1038
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,099
anchored in in a number in a limited

1039
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:17,099
number of global cities

1040
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:20,220
some empirics uh from a dear a colleague

1041
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,700
from it will be much even clicking in uh

1042
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,240
who did a kind of nice set of maps on

1043
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,700
law firms in Brussels it's kind of

1044
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,599
interesting to see that the

1045
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:33,599
concentration in global cities you could

1046
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,700
say when at the more abstract level also

1047
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,040
translate into clusters at the

1048
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,140
Metropolitan level and it tells us

1049
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,819
something about you could say the more

1050
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:44,700
micro sociologies and geographies of

1051
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,319
these kind of Professional Services so

1052
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,240
what you see is on the left hand side

1053
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,339
law firms

1054
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:53,280
um the big picture are foreign law firms

1055
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,780
the smaller insect map is is Belgian

1056
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,099
firms the number of commonalities

1057
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:04,380
which is kind of the center of a very

1058
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,720
rich neighborhoods or set of

1059
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,180
neighborhoods in South Brussels is a

1060
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,420
location of both uh I think Belgian

1061
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,720
um Boutique law firms and also larger

1062
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,359
Law Firm but one is foreign law firms

1063
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:21,420
but what is special for the foreign law

1064
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,280
firms they're very much concentrated

1065
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,280
around the EU District okay so a lot of

1066
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,440
activities either have something to do

1067
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,400
with

1068
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,280
uh deploy their clients that are located

1069
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,140
there which is either directly the

1070
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,500
European commission or

1071
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,880
um or firms that's want to Lobby uh the

1072
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,160
European commission and this is kind of

1073
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,200
a process that we'll talk a bit more uh

1074
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,240
when we do the

1075
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,819
um the tour in Brussels in uh the end of

1076
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:53,400
next week okay so micro geographies are

1077
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,980
also uh produced microclusters produced

1078
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,900
at the urban level the same as for

1079
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,780
instance through in um in London has

1080
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,339
some great work by

1081
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,160
um cook at all not Captain Cook but

1082
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,880
another cook so we cooked up this figure

1083
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,260
um obviously what you see there is the

1084
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,300
city of London which is also a very

1085
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,940
particular uh jurisdiction in and of

1086
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,099
itself it's it has some kind of an

1087
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,920
exceptional rule that doesn't follow the

1088
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,079
regulations of you could say the

1089
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,420
continent in this case the UK in and of

1090
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,339
itself the government in a very weird

1091
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,800
way I never I can never recall how

1092
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,359
exactly and I'm not even sure that

1093
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:33,000
information is themselves but it's kind

1094
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,300
of a self Corp I mean the self-regulated

1095
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,400
self governed

1096
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
um jurisdiction

1097
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,400
on on the island

1098
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,819
where corporations also have a large uh

1099
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,819
say in okay so within the LA the limits

1100
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:52,920
of the city of London uh you find

1101
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,660
particular regulations there that's why

1102
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,940
the stock exchange is located there and

1103
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,560
all the financial institutions are

1104
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,319
located around and then besides that the

1105
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:03,359
specialized District the legal District

1106
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,420
etc etc so this tendency of of seeking

1107
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,520
proximity is also evidence yeah

1108
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:19,380
firms also uh interact with one another

1109
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,700
um so this is some work we did in

1110
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,020
Brussels uh we took a corporate survey

1111
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,960
uh aimed at uh APS professionals so we

1112
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,540
we sent the survey around to it with a

1113
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,180
league less expert ICT experts etc etc

1114
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,000
bankers and they kind of listed how they

1115
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,220
interacted with other APS firms either

1116
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,839
in their daily practice for themselves

1117
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:43,800
or as they uh were giving services to

1118
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,839
their customers okay and what you find

1119
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,780
is actually quite a bit of interaction

1120
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,880
um with sector itself

1121
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,119
uh and also particularly between sectors

1122
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,599
and law and finance law accountancy and

1123
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,880
law and against and financial services

1124
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,960
so just imagine uh as a corporation what

1125
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,559
often happens is that yeah when you

1126
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:10,260
issue some kind of financial product

1127
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,880
think about

1128
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,220
um a share or something or you want to

1129
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,720
go for a loan

1130
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,760
then we need a financial institution we

1131
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,579
need a law firm that needs to kind of uh

1132
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,980
come up with a prospectus or check the

1133
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,440
perspectives that is that is made by um

1134
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,160
by financial institutions uh Auditors

1135
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,960
and an accountant would have a look at

1136
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,960
that so this is a kind of connected uh

1137
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,839
thing to financial markets what we also

1138
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,520
found is quite some interaction between

1139
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,220
ICT and financial services this has

1140
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,599
something to do with you could say the

1141
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,579
digitization of finance that is

1142
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:46,859
currently going on

1143
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:49,440
um so quite a bit of interdependencies

1144
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,300
between different sectors will also

1145
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,119
explains why does the need for proximity

1146
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,380
yes there's a question

1147
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:01,859
that's a very good question

1148
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:04,260
um what do I remember from these

1149
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,260
percentages I think

1150
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,900
um all right so I think the um yeah

1151
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,300
that's it's standardized to the you

1152
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,099
could say the largest link so we looked

1153
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,540
at you could say the intensity of

1154
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,640
interactions and we found that within

1155
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,800
financial services this has the

1156
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,839
strongest link so

1157
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,880
it's it's a it's a relative scale so

1158
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,119
that's the strongest link it's uh 100

1159
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:28,500
and then you when you for instance look

1160
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,900
at the relation between law and

1161
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,960
financial services the strength of the

1162
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,300
tie between law and finance is only half

1163
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,460
of the kind of relations within Finance

1164
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,880
itself

1165
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,420
um it was measured in a different way

1166
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:50,220
it's measured uh by frequency so uh on a

1167
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:54,839
regular basis how much do you uh hire

1168
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:59,940
advice uh in you could say law etc etc

1169
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,020
um

1170
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,059
but there's other ways of of measuring

1171
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,880
that for sure okay so it's it's one way

1172
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,480
of doing that so yes this kind of

1173
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,880
um gravitational pull towards other

1174
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,520
actors in This APS complex explains kind

1175
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,440
of the reproduction of global cities

1176
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,800
another one was indeed this

1177
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,040
globalization of strategies of uh APS

1178
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,839
firms themselves so they're both

1179
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,940
clustered and they're globalized at the

1180
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,059
same time uh Deloitte

1181
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,760
um well I mean it's part of its uh of

1182
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,819
its branding process HSBC it's the same

1183
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:37,859
thing so it's playing on both being

1184
00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:40,200
Global and tapping into local knowledge

1185
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,200
okay you may think about that what we

1186
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,359
want but it's certainly a part of their

1187
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,520
corporate strategy or the geographical

1188
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,079
strategy

1189
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:50,339
Etc

1190
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:54,720
okay yes okay that's probably early days

1191
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,339
but are you guys looking at all about

1192
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:57,900
how

1193
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,400
coveted forward

1194
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:06,960
uh no I was taking care of my children

1195
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,359
um no uh but I think that's a good point

1196
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,059
I mean

1197
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:13,740
uh I think for sure there has been a

1198
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,280
tremendous impact on business travel

1199
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,800
but it's also kind of a long discussion

1200
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,839
as to what extent you need business

1201
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,240
travel these are the video conferencing

1202
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,819
and other kinds of things

1203
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:27,540
um

1204
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,460
so there's already quite a bit of

1205
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,800
research in there there's also you could

1206
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,559
say more ethnographic approaches uh that

1207
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,420
are kind of questioning

1208
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,359
uh the actual data relevance of having a

1209
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,119
global network but differently are these

1210
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,220
offices really being used or are they

1211
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,319
mainly there to have an address and

1212
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,319
populate websites uh and then you may

1213
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,000
actually find that it's much more

1214
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,520
concentrated within a number of global

1215
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,859
cities despite having a very Global

1216
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,559
Network and there could be other ways of

1217
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,839
organizing yourself either having

1218
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,819
temporary clusters or meetings or

1219
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:05,460
conferences to make things work that

1220
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,800
there's also and we'll read a bit about

1221
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,260
that a practice of circumference of

1222
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,200
people that are that are based in London

1223
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,880
that are then two years based in

1224
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,440
Singapore so there are other kind of

1225
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,180
strategies

1226
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,000
um but yeah the main kind of question

1227
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,980
will indeed be

1228
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,180
um

1229
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,720
covet now the final proof that there's

1230
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,760
an end to the city

1231
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,059
I think that's hugely overblown and I

1232
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:34,559
think that's quite a quite a bit of

1233
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,260
reasons about the knowledge and density

1234
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,960
of certain practices that explains why

1235
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,079
face-to-face and direction will prevail

1236
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,920
just as uh when you think about teaching

1237
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,960
there's hopefully some added value to

1238
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,480
face-to-face teaching over looking at a

1239
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,579
screen

1240
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:54,839
and it has something to do with the

1241
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:56,880
interpretation of information and is

1242
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,220
being shared about how grounding

1243
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,559
processes work do we think the same

1244
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,160
about certain Concepts Etc and if you

1245
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,800
don't do this face to face you just miss

1246
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,200
out on this micro uh feedback loops if

1247
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,240
this would be online I wouldn't see

1248
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,180
nodding or frowning so I would be in

1249
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,460
trouble sometimes okay so I think yeah

1250
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,640
it's clearly it's a very important

1251
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,839
question

1252
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,300
there will probably be a more strategic

1253
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,240
use of these sites and will also be a

1254
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,220
more selective use of face-to-face

1255
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,540
interaction which were done ultimately

1256
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,880
also input

1257
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,599
um

1258
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,760
input APS activities and their

1259
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,099
geographies but it won't lead to a

1260
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:44,400
dissolution I think personally uh I see

1261
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,319
no no theoretical reasons why that

1262
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,380
should be obsolete

1263
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,079
but it's uh it's it's research that

1264
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,240
could be done and I mean there's a whole

1265
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,700
class of uh of people digital Nomads uh

1266
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,280
these are more you could say

1267
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,660
self-employed they don't depend on other

1268
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,480
inputs uh in their production process

1269
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,700
think about setting up a website or

1270
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,680
something you can just go to Bali and do

1271
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,200
that from there but even there you see

1272
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,300
uh the emergence of temporary clusters

1273
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,800
other digital Nomads that are in Bali to

1274
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,660
discuss stuff

1275
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:25,140
etc etc so I think even there there's a

1276
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,619
social aspect to that and you get the

1277
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:31,800
return of centrality even where you

1278
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,780
don't expect it and it seems to be

1279
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,420
something that is related to the fact

1280
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,800
that we're talking about cognitive

1281
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,920
culture capitalism and that's a

1282
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,099
excellent bridge to what Aaron Scott is

1283
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:45,240
talking about

1284
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,480
in his notion of global city regions so

1285
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,460
we talked about world cities corporate

1286
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,220
headquarters sussing talks about global

1287
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,619
cities you look into a wider complex of

1288
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:57,660
these Advanced Services that sit around

1289
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,520
corporations

1290
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,319
and then uh Alan Scott who says well

1291
00:58:03,319 --> 00:58:06,300
you and your world in global cities how

1292
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,059
do you explain something like this which

1293
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,359
is a much larger conversation which is

1294
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:15,540
urban to some extent which depends here

1295
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,180
on San Francisco

1296
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,880
in case you haven't noticed but how do

1297
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,800
you make sense of this wider San

1298
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,559
Francisco Bay area with a lot of we

1299
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:27,599
could say centrality but it's not

1300
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,520
necessarily connected to poor

1301
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,119
metropolitan areas so what kind of Alan

1302
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,579
Scott is talking about and says yes uh

1303
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,559
very nice that we talk about this

1304
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,059
classic

1305
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:41,460
um world and Global cities when you when

1306
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,500
you look for instance she was talking

1307
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,079
about New York London Tokyo later on

1308
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,400
Chicago

1309
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,099
uh neat metropolitan areas but there's

1310
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,440
other kind of structures uh

1311
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,420
morphological structures polocentric

1312
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,799
regions that do not necessarily fit the

1313
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:02,240
definition uh that that

1314
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,740
Sasuke assassin or John Friedman is

1315
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,599
talking about and that also links a

1316
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:07,920
little bit to what we discussed last

1317
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,480
week

1318
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,480
um how the city looks like or where the

1319
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,000
urban is can actually spill over

1320
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,579
metropolitan areas okay

1321
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:20,760
so clearly places like uh like Silicon

1322
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,900
Valley

1323
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,299
um they're not dependent on the poor

1324
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:28,200
urban area per se but they also kind of

1325
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,420
um an example of the need for proximity

1326
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:35,599
and high-end Advanced sectors right so

1327
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,420
what Al Scott says is that yes

1328
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,359
something is right

1329
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,540
but the kind of wider uh process that is

1330
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,000
going on is a process towards centrality

1331
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,839
in knowledge intensive

1332
00:59:50,839 --> 00:59:54,660
activities and this pertains to ABS

1333
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,400
firms that are located and you could say

1334
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,980
the poor metropolitan areas but it also

1335
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:02,700
applies to high-tech firms the gaffa's

1336
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,339
platform corporations etc etc all these

1337
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,559
kind of innovations that came out of

1338
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:09,540
Silicon Valley for instance or when you

1339
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,339
look at the Pearl River delta which is a

1340
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:14,040
kind of much more Polo Centric uh

1341
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,579
production area in in the southeast of

1342
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:19,619
of China

1343
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,680
um it's also a form of centrality uh

1344
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,720
where you have some metropolitan areas

1345
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,640
or Metropolitan courts but it also goes

1346
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,160
beyond there so what what interests Alan

1347
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,339
Scott is more yeah this driver of

1348
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:35,460
centrality Beyond APS themselves and it

1349
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,859
says look at the centrality uh that

1350
01:00:37,859 --> 01:00:40,500
Sasuke assassin finds is actually part

1351
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,619
and parser of a wider uh shift towards

1352
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:45,900
cognitive cultural capitalism right so

1353
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,000
CCC

1354
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,520
and it means that a lot of economic

1355
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,940
activities crucially depends on on

1356
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:57,240
knowledge inputs and types of knowledge

1357
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,420
that are not generic not standardized

1358
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,319
that are not easily appreciable at a

1359
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,960
distance no you need interpretation

1360
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,540
dialogue with clients dialogue with

1361
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,119
other colleagues to make sense of what

1362
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:14,579
is going on because it's a very complex

1363
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:15,420
matter

1364
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,579
you need to make sense of the situation

1365
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:20,220
collectively and hence there's a drive

1366
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:23,940
for proximity there okay and this

1367
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:28,440
applies to an increased uh part of of

1368
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,260
the economy which also means that it it

1369
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,540
goes Way Beyond the first producer

1370
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,619
surface so and the spatial form it takes

1371
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:39,780
is is one of global city regions so you

1372
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,940
have a more polymorphic quality

1373
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,339
polycentric kind of structure

1374
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:47,040
and his kind of meta geography if you

1375
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,680
will is a world of global city regions

1376
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,619
with this kind of interconnection

1377
01:01:51,619 --> 01:01:54,660
interconnected and Blazer role in these

1378
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,180
uh Global production networks in global

1379
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,319
markets yes

1380
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,380
yes

1381
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,420
and this we need this kind of connected

1382
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,880
to this APS that are all this service is

1383
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,859
connected to

1384
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:19,799
um well the point by Scott is that uh

1385
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:23,280
yes in APS and law firms Finance Etc

1386
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,440
there's a clear need for proximity for

1387
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,119
the reason that we've been discussing

1388
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,760
but this also applies to other parts of

1389
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,660
the economy think about high-tech

1390
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:37,220
um think about education or whatever

1391
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,540
and these are also prone to this

1392
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,760
agglomeration Dynamics and that is

1393
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,140
because

1394
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:46,020
um increasingly the production process

1395
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:49,859
is knowledge intensive just compared to

1396
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:51,599
um you could say 50 years ago it would

1397
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,160
have been a very standardized process

1398
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,059
just make 1 000 cars per week

1399
01:02:57,059 --> 01:02:59,760
this is becoming increasingly customized

1400
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,400
uh it's much more about prototyping it's

1401
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,920
much more about

1402
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,960
tailoring uh particular cars I mean I

1403
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,280
don't know anything about cars but I'm

1404
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,880
I'm stuck with cars

1405
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,819
so it's it's much much more uh just in

1406
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:17,460
time delivery it's much more tailored

1407
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,220
rather than than mass production that

1408
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,640
used to be the case uh in the 50s 60s

1409
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,520
70s and this has shifted

1410
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,040
roughly in the 1980s where it was more

1411
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,559
about flexible production systems where

1412
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:33,420
you could say the connection with

1413
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,760
suppliers but also customers clients

1414
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,040
became much more important so it's a

1415
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,720
kind of broad scale

1416
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,579
restructuring of the economy which also

1417
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:44,400
explains why proximity matters not only

1418
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,859
in these Advanced administers but more

1419
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:49,740
broadly to bitcoin I don't understand

1420
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,740
what drives

1421
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,319
these companies together in Silicon

1422
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:56,880
Valley for example

1423
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,520
okay well I have a whole lecture on that

1424
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,040
and economic and financial geography but

1425
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,799
I mean in part part of the story as you

1426
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,780
could say the Contemporary benefits of

1427
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,760
economic agglomeration which has

1428
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,680
something to do with yeah what economic

1429
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,720
geographers call positive externalities

1430
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,000
by being there you get certain benefits

1431
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,980
that you wouldn't get if you're not

1432
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:17,880
there

1433
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,359
stepping into high-scaled labor uh High

1434
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,579
skilled labor for instance Venture

1435
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:26,460
Capital etc etc but there's a lot of uh

1436
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,260
what people call Cloud dependencies as

1437
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,760
well and when you look at the story of

1438
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,460
Silicon Valley there used to be a lot of

1439
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,220
government investment there

1440
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,680
um I think U.S military and the

1441
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,780
semiconductor business making chips and

1442
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,420
those kind of things was hugely funded

1443
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,940
by the federal government

1444
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,640
in NASA DARPA and all kind of Ministry

1445
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,780
of Defense

1446
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,299
and a lot of these Innovations within

1447
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:54,059
later on commercialized by private

1448
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:55,440
players

1449
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,960
who then use these Technologies to build

1450
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,119
their own platforms and there's great

1451
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:02,160
work by Mariana matsukata for instance

1452
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,940
who uh who's a great Economist who says

1453
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,660
well if you look at your iPad

1454
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,359
almost every critical

1455
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:14,460
uh element there piece of technology can

1456
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,380
be related back to some kind of federal

1457
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:20,280
investment uh etc etc so

1458
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,680
which brings certain to an argument

1459
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,079
about is it really private Innovation

1460
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:27,299
that we're talking about or does it have

1461
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:28,799
something to do with sustained

1462
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,799
investment by public authorities in

1463
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:33,780
these kind of Investments the same is is

1464
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,880
true for big Pharma for instance it's

1465
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,400
universities that come up with new

1466
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,660
vaccines and these are then

1467
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,720
commercialized by Pfizer Etc

1468
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,599
um so it's very complex story and no

1469
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,599
clear answers it's a field of its own uh

1470
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:50,520
but what we need to do we need to

1471
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,400
understand is that this proximity and

1472
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,099
the centrality goes beyond cities

1473
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:57,420
themselves

1474
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,359
okay so it's it's much more prevailing

1475
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:02,040
process

1476
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,680
but still I mean the point being is that

1477
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,640
at some point APS firms uh even in these

1478
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,319
Global city regions they would still

1479
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,819
have some kind of a role to play as

1480
01:06:11,819 --> 01:06:14,099
connectors think about Silicon Valley

1481
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:15,660
firms

1482
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:18,540
um that come up with new technologies or

1483
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:21,660
that want to make make a profit out of

1484
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,640
these new Innovations

1485
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,680
they would have to be kind of certified

1486
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,900
patented their intellectual property

1487
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,940
would be protected as probably very

1488
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,859
likely that would be uh San

1489
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:34,140
francisco-based law firms that would

1490
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:40,520
then specialize in okay uh yep

1491
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:54,720
well I mean they're not you now this

1492
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,400
kind of these are the debates I'm just

1493
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,160
rehearsing the debate of the 1980s 90s

1494
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,559
slowly getting to the Northeast and

1495
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,180
we'll we'll move through that uh

1496
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,799
throughout the lecture

1497
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:05,760
um

1498
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,579
uh but this mainly tries to capture what

1499
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:12,059
went on uh in the 1980s and what what

1500
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:14,520
was the starting point if you will of a

1501
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,200
theorizing of world and Global cities

1502
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,619
right now

1503
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,079
there was a belt yeah

1504
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:36,420
well uh well there there so the question

1505
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,579
is as to what extent is the Rust Belt a

1506
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:41,940
global City I don't think I mean it it

1507
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,700
would uh Alan Scott would really see

1508
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,619
that as a as a global City region

1509
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:48,960
because it's it's mostly you could say

1510
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,539
uh a remnant of an older process of

1511
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:53,640
industrialization which was much more

1512
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,619
focused on mass production so think

1513
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:59,400
about uh factories in Pittsburgh Detroit

1514
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,260
etc etc

1515
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,599
the fort Factory

1516
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,400
um and this was kind of in the history

1517
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,039
of the of the US it was a kind of

1518
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:10,260
process of industrialization that was

1519
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,260
finalized but on its returns since since

1520
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,599
the 60s 70s and then you had to switch

1521
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,679
to the Sunbelt States uh a lot of

1522
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,060
production especially in the car

1523
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,179
industry was taken over by Japanese

1524
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:25,799
Investments and a lot of states where

1525
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:30,719
the labor rights were less protected so

1526
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:35,520
mm-hmm

1527
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,219
I mean the difference would be uh to

1528
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:39,779
what it's and I mean it's just one

1529
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:41,219
example but the question would be to

1530
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:44,759
what extent do uh in this day and age uh

1531
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:47,100
knowledge synthetic intensive production

1532
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,779
activities or other activities takes

1533
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:50,640
place in the Rust Belt I think to some

1534
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,859
extent this is the case but it wouldn't

1535
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:56,219
be an uh a leading example I don't want

1536
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:58,500
to be exclusive I think it could be

1537
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,359
visualized as such but it would be more

1538
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,339
of an empirical question to what extent

1539
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,439
is actually taking place

1540
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:07,439
um whether it's just a morphology of old

1541
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,979
Industrial Area like the rural area or

1542
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:12,238
whether there's some kind of an

1543
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,359
integrated region which you do see in

1544
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,219
Silicon Valley because it's kind of all

1545
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:20,160
organized about technology

1546
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,500
um we could perhaps argue that it used

1547
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,520
to be a global City region of yesteryear

1548
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,500
uh but perhaps the globalization was

1549
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,299
less less advanced

1550
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:33,000
there and then uh or at least it would

1551
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,580
be would be different

1552
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,319
okay just to say there's different

1553
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:39,420
conceptualization let's try to capture

1554
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,179
functions but also the morphology of

1555
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:44,040
these places and I think it's something

1556
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,100
to reflect on uh and comparing uh where

1557
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,620
you get okay

1558
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:50,520
um

1559
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,679
yeah I think in the interest of time I

1560
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:56,040
will have to move on because I I'm using

1561
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,320
a lot of words uh but I think it's

1562
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,140
important that things are clear

1563
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,480
um so second of all and I might speed up

1564
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,460
a little bit I want to give you a

1565
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,880
methodological example of how people

1566
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,160
actually dealt with this conceptual

1567
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,560
apparatus of world and Global cities in

1568
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,140
global city regions

1569
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:18,120
to measure these processes or

1570
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,179
empirically study these processes

1571
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:23,040
so this is the work by the globalization

1572
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,159
and world cities research Network

1573
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,460
um and it basically starts with

1574
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:32,100
um with a number of questions I mean

1575
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,400
uh when you look at some of these claims

1576
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,340
I mean it's it's one thing to say yeah

1577
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:41,219
we have to acknowledge world city

1578
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:42,900
formation process of global City

1579
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,640
formation process or to say that

1580
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,320
inter-urban connections are really

1581
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,600
important and actually when you start

1582
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,400
diving into this

1583
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,600
and you quickly run into into trouble

1584
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,100
um and this is actually something that

1585
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,199
that was kind of loaded already in the

1586
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:01,860
90s uh so a very long time ago but I

1587
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,900
want to give you the entire development

1588
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,060
of the agenda

1589
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,699
um that is actually quite quite few

1590
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:11,880
insight into uh world city Network

1591
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,920
formation so we had a number of case

1592
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,080
studies in the 80s and 90s especially

1593
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,719
with Sasuke assassin on a particular set

1594
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,580
of cities along the New York et cetera

1595
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,739
Etc there was all kinds of hypothesis

1596
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:24,960
and claims about the insertion in a

1597
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,699
global Urban system

1598
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,820
but actually empirically there was very

1599
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,280
little insight into this so what

1600
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,040
connects cities how Central was cities

1601
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,560
in these Urban systems

1602
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,100
I was kind of uh very much an ad hoc

1603
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,860
answer that you get to the extent that

1604
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,739
uh John Randy short said there's even a

1605
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:49,199
dirty little secret in world cities

1606
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:52,140
research actually empirically there's

1607
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,360
very little on the actual connections

1608
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,280
being made between cities so we don't

1609
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,280
really know a lot about this this is

1610
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,620
something that's uh kind of a research

1611
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:06,420
Gap to use neoliberals uh academic speak

1612
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,140
um

1613
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:09,960
that uh that the globalization and World

1614
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,860
Series research network was checked onto

1615
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,440
um and there was a number of ways of

1616
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,020
trying to to deal with that

1617
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,280
um

1618
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,500
people try to work with secondary data

1619
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,219
in the 1990s of starting 1990s thinking

1620
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:29,520
about for instance yeah uh looking at at

1621
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,000
the flows of airline passengers so our

1622
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,400
cities connected

1623
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,960
um by by Airlines

1624
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,239
this for instance gave rise to these

1625
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,460
kind of

1626
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,060
type of research and this shows you

1627
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,580
say the world city Network on the basis

1628
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,739
of Airline flows

1629
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:56,540
any idea whether this is a viable method

1630
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:00,120
can we measure the centrality of cities

1631
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,400
in the global economy by using Airline

1632
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,820
flows

1633
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,540
bill

1634
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:14,219
foreign

1635
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,780
yeah so some major airports are not

1636
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,480
necessarily in global cities yeah other

1637
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,719
ideas

1638
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,659
I couldn't find any data okay other

1639
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:42,360
kinds of sources to be used okay so the

1640
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,420
flow of Bitcoins okay yeah I'm bit more

1641
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,340
particularly with with this kind of data

1642
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:51,739
on airline flows other ideas yes

1643
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,300
traveling or

1644
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,940
absolutely different kind of attitude

1645
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:02,840
absolutely yeah other ideas

1646
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,149
[Music]

1647
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,179
that's exactly the same I mean it's

1648
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:14,340
debatable I mean are you measuring

1649
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,260
economic importance or are you measuring

1650
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:19,100
command and control

1651
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,040
yeah that was also the kind of yeah

1652
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,920
there's a hub and spoke system people

1653
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,020
write about papers flying where you

1654
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,480
don't want to go uh so it doesn't really

1655
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,640
connect I mean there's a lot of people

1656
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,400
in Reykjavik but not necessarily to um

1657
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,280
to do anything there yeah and the other

1658
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,520
ideas

1659
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,219
yeah yes yes yes absolutely yeah okay so

1660
01:14:56,219 --> 01:14:59,520
I mean it's uh I mean at First Sight you

1661
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,620
kind of can do something because it's a

1662
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:03,060
kind of intuitive picture here

1663
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,100
especially when you look at the top of

1664
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,679
the hierarchy uh so you find that New

1665
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,580
York and London is actually there uh but

1666
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,860
then you quite quickly go into all kinds

1667
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,900
of anomalies yeah

1668
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,679
these Hub airports that's that um uh are

1669
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,380
kind of not necessarily relevant tourist

1670
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,300
destinations which tell us something

1671
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,100
about economic importance but not

1672
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,780
necessarily about the importance in

1673
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,300
terms of controlling the global economy

1674
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,280
which is kind of a different kind of

1675
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,260
process

1676
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:35,580
um

1677
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,380
yeah I was going to say something else

1678
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:40,380
about that but it's yeah uh I forgot

1679
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,880
about it

1680
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,100
um yeah so we can also think about about

1681
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,860
new data Collections and

1682
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,860
um so we have Bitcoins is one way and I

1683
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:50,940
want to pick your brain a little bit

1684
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:53,340
more on that but before that I mean just

1685
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,540
saying that

1686
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:57,480
uh one of the big struggles in the 1990s

1687
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,460
that researchers Urban researchers were

1688
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,140
confronted with and this is still the

1689
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,360
case today and you'll probably note that

1690
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,420
in some of your courses is that a lot of

1691
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,060
the statistics are collected at the

1692
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,520
state level and not necessarily at the

1693
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,719
urban level

1694
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,500
and Peter Taylor uh by now Emeritus

1695
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,480
Professor that founded the globalization

1696
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,040
of world city research not to always

1697
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,920
refer to this notion of Statistics it

1698
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,620
connected to

1699
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,820
statistics and indicators that were

1700
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,320
collected by the national state to

1701
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,620
measure the national economy etc etc and

1702
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,900
at some point the centrality of cities

1703
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,760
in economic process

1704
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,659
has only Krypton uh slightly so we we

1705
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:41,699
have sometimes at the national level

1706
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:44,540
indicators about cities but then

1707
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,580
inter-city connections and flows it's

1708
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,260
very hard think about trade flows for

1709
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,179
instance

1710
01:16:50,179 --> 01:16:54,000
it's between National economies but you

1711
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,760
really have to assume that probably

1712
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,699
the major metropolitan areas will be

1713
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:01,560
more tight into this process than others

1714
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,920
yes

1715
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,620
um

1716
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,360
sorry yeah

1717
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,800
um yeah or like South American

1718
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,600
interviews and a lot of resource

1719
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,560
extraction happened in these places and

1720
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,239
uh

1721
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,860
no no but these yeah I mean it's always

1722
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,360
a question and we'll return to that

1723
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,600
about the the power of representation

1724
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,860
this is the result of when you cut off

1725
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:34,199
the list at some point so it's the most

1726
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:36,440
connected places just in terms of

1727
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,880
Passenger flows which is another reason

1728
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,080
why it's not a parade example

1729
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,159
yeah but you can turn it around and you

1730
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:50,100
can focus on Africa uh African cities

1731
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,739
and how they're connected in uh in

1732
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:55,620
global global airline networks so you

1733
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,239
could do some kind of if you will bottom

1734
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,100
of analysis and it's actually something

1735
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:00,719
that we did that we look at the

1736
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,000
evolution of African cities and global

1737
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,820
airline networks and it could tell you

1738
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:07,679
give you a hint about how these places

1739
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,620
are are internationalizing the

1740
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:13,020
globalization Global globalizing through

1741
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,480
their Airline networks but even then

1742
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,820
could still be a very rough uh rough

1743
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,739
figure and it would also as we found

1744
01:18:19,739 --> 01:18:21,960
capture other kinds of processes the

1745
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,900
liberalization of the airline industry

1746
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,020
in Africa rather than the increased

1747
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,460
importance of someone

1748
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:32,400
uh cities in the global Urban Network

1749
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,520
so yeah just just to give you an idea of

1750
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,540
what is the trouble when you start

1751
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,699
looking for new kind of data you perhaps

1752
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:41,040
can think a little bit about what other

1753
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,340
kinds of summations uh you could use

1754
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,199
and it was exactly kind of a conundrum

1755
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:48,239
or thing that that people were were

1756
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:52,320
chewing on in the 1990s and as it became

1757
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,300
evident that some kind of new meta

1758
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,780
geography uh was needed and I'm using

1759
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:01,199
meta geography in a sense uh that it

1760
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:04,320
refers to a social spatial structure if

1761
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,840
you will that helps to make sense of the

1762
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,140
world so it's a geography that explains

1763
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:15,060
uh how processes work like the nation

1764
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,460
states tells us something about to what

1765
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,520
extent uh

1766
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,520
identitarian politics is able to

1767
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,800
territorialize I mean to to make it

1768
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,020
difficult

1769
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,900
whereas uh whereas perhaps

1770
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,699
um the world city Network tries to

1771
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:36,000
capture uh the integrated fashion of

1772
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,699
economic processes and this is actually

1773
01:19:38,699 --> 01:19:39,659
what

1774
01:19:39,659 --> 01:19:42,179
uh what Manuel costells was writing

1775
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:44,460
about in the 1990s when he was talking

1776
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,400
about this space of float which you put

1777
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,440
into opposition with the space of places

1778
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,199
so he said well we have this traditional

1779
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:55,560
view of the world as a mosaic of

1780
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,480
territorial States

1781
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,480
which are kind of yeah if you put them

1782
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,300
together you get a world map but there's

1783
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,820
another kind of geography that is out

1784
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:08,239
there which is

1785
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,679
discontinuous so it's it's kind of it's

1786
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,659
not a continuous space these are kind of

1787
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:15,000
islands if you will that are connected

1788
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,800
to flows of goods people

1789
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,159
um money knowledge etc etc so this is

1790
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:25,320
kind of characterizing the space of

1791
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,300
float and it's kind of it's a

1792
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,219
socialization process this sociologist

1793
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:34,440
so as a society emerging on that and it

1794
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:38,940
was a kind of uh kind of visionary I but

1795
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:41,280
I I he intended to be Visionary in a

1796
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,380
sense that this would be the norm so we

1797
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,020
would be become the network Society we

1798
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,960
can wonder about that but what is kind

1799
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,400
of still relevant I think is that

1800
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,020
there's a tension between these spaces

1801
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,780
of flows so these islands of connected

1802
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,600
urban areas

1803
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,600
uh which is to some degree detached from

1804
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,780
a mosaic of city-states and there's all

1805
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,360
kinds of oppositions between that if you

1806
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,699
look at the election map in the UK not

1807
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:11,820
the election map the referendum map

1808
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,400
um and you look at the

1809
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,960
leaf or remain

1810
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,880
uh vote

1811
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,460
it was clear that London uh wanted to

1812
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,080
stay in which tells us something about

1813
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,900
the importance of being remaining

1814
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,280
connected to we could say other

1815
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,080
Financial Centers on the European

1816
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,480
continent the rest of Britain I mean

1817
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,060
summarizing now

1818
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:35,159
uh was was against that which shows that

1819
01:21:35,159 --> 01:21:37,320
there's a disconnect in the daily lives

1820
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:41,100
of people uh to um to to the interest of

1821
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,960
the city

1822
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,199
um I'm not saying that uh the leaf uh

1823
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:47,880
campaign actually connected to the real

1824
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,920
needs of Brits but that's another kind

1825
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,560
of discussion okay so this space is a

1826
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,179
flows served as a kind of new method

1827
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:55,980
geography which then was an impetus to

1828
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,840
start collecting new data which

1829
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,659
ultimately brings me to

1830
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:03,420
um the god heuristic and I'll try to be

1831
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,219
as brief as possible in the interest of

1832
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:07,199
time it's also not something that you

1833
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,760
need to

1834
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,860
I don't know you don't you don't study

1835
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:13,620
this by heart but it's a way uh to kind

1836
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:17,780
of appreciate a certain methodology

1837
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,420
um so just go to this website once at

1838
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:24,060
least uh it's hosted by Loughborough

1839
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,159
University in East England in the

1840
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:27,500
Midlands

1841
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,840
uh it's a very interesting source for

1842
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,340
urban level

1843
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,920
case studies uh studies on

1844
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,920
connectivities between cities that you

1845
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,600
can also use for other courses I'm

1846
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,640
thinking of the course by bus for

1847
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,860
instance so

1848
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,960
um it's quite a quite an inventory of

1849
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:49,199
nice case studies uh there so what's the

1850
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,940
starting point of this you could say

1851
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,699
project uh by globalization of World

1852
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:57,000
Series research network was is let's

1853
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,600
take APS firms as the clearest indicator

1854
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:05,340
space species of this new space of flows

1855
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,260
so there's a new space flows that

1856
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,420
characterizes how the global economy and

1857
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:12,239
Global Society works and as we read

1858
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:15,719
castell's assassin it's very likely that

1859
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:18,780
if we use these corporations we'll be

1860
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:22,800
able to indicate a command and control

1861
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,020
functions cities so the starting point

1862
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:28,080
are the geographies of APs firms to tell

1863
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,060
us something about world and Global

1864
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,239
cities

1865
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,260
the reason is as I explained earlier

1866
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,020
these APS firms rnms and of themselves

1867
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:39,659
International Players they are they have

1868
01:23:39,659 --> 01:23:42,060
a global City geography if you will so

1869
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:44,940
it makes sense to start looking into

1870
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,260
those

1871
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:48,480
and the idea is that you can actually

1872
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,219
build a model

1873
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:54,780
on the basis of these APS geographies

1874
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,659
and the model is based on

1875
01:23:57,659 --> 01:24:00,600
the co-presence the shared presence of

1876
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,320
APs firms in multiple cities

1877
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,600
summarize is one in one and whatever

1878
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,060
it will make connection between these

1879
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,219
two cities and we can assume that there

1880
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:17,340
will be some kind of flow of probably

1881
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:21,179
emails telephone calls ideas there will

1882
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:22,920
be secondments people will travel

1883
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,199
between these officers money will flow

1884
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:28,560
between these officers etc etc so the

1885
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,260
shared presence of APs firm in multiple

1886
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:33,719
cities so one firm being located in

1887
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:36,000
multiple cities so and there's three

1888
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,460
steps with any model you need to specify

1889
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:41,040
it then you can measure it it's filling

1890
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,080
it with data and then hopefully

1891
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,179
something comes out of this this model

1892
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:47,460
okay

1893
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:51,360
so yeah how does gork solve it so just

1894
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,500
as a as a random example a number of

1895
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,480
global or world cities New York London

1896
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,239
Brussels Kuala Lumpur and Hamburg

1897
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,100
and these are kind of

1898
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,280
contain spaces with a number of firms in

1899
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,820
there and these are our APS firms so

1900
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:11,880
this is a model this thing cities and

1901
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,940
they host APS firms so many firms are

1902
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:18,780
actually the same okay so we have by now

1903
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,780
uh transformed uh corporations such as

1904
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:23,880
Audra Anderson Lesnar Von Clifford

1905
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,739
chance the law firm Bruce Allen Hamilton

1906
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:29,340
Lloyds as an insurance company so just

1907
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,679
to give you some impressions

1908
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,739
so how is it specified what does God do

1909
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:37,920
it says well oh there's a firm here in

1910
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,900
London or Brussels

1911
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:42,540
how important is this firm actually okay

1912
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:45,179
so you try to measure this in an

1913
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:47,760
objective or at least standardized way

1914
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,560
so that you make the same error every

1915
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:53,580
time or that you write every time so you

1916
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,920
say okay for this one office in Brussels

1917
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,400
by Barclays or something or HSBC a bank

1918
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,739
how important is it and we use a very

1919
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:04,620
standard scale zero to five no offers ah

1920
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:07,560
easy you give it a zero uh oh it's the

1921
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,659
global headquarters then it's a five

1922
01:26:09,659 --> 01:26:11,280
okay and throughout the agent you see

1923
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,679
but it would be I don't know KBC or

1924
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,960
something like that large Belgium tank

1925
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,360
okay and then there's a whole range in

1926
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,380
between

1927
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:22,620
a typical office would be two maybe a

1928
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,239
regional headquarters and there's a lot

1929
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,760
of those in Brussels that actually

1930
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:30,179
control European activities uh would be

1931
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:32,460
a three or a four

1932
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,199
um so yeah this is kind of the idea

1933
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:37,080
there's a hierarchy and office functions

1934
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,120
and we can measure this in a

1935
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,760
standardized way

1936
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,440
nervous values

1937
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:47,460
so imagine what the importance of of uh

1938
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,739
the connection between uh two offices

1939
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:53,460
would be so a very important office in

1940
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:54,420
Brussels

1941
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:57,420
a very important office in London would

1942
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:00,360
probably generate more traffic in terms

1943
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,300
of emails than phone calls which is then

1944
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,760
again a proxy for you could say the

1945
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,980
importance of the activities in global

1946
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:10,380
command temperature okay so it's

1947
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,840
basically calculating the Intercity

1948
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,060
relation the R value there

1949
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:18,420
by multiplying these service values so

1950
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:20,580
very basic so you have a very important

1951
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,920
one times a very important one gives you

1952
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,380
a very strong relation between these two

1953
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,120
places okay

1954
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,100
it looks a bit like that you can imagine

1955
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:30,840
the connection so

1956
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,820
the thicker the line the more important

1957
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,380
the connection between these kind of

1958
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,560
offices uh and yeah

1959
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,739
you can populate a complete Matrix with

1960
01:27:40,739 --> 01:27:43,440
that you could do that in Infinity until

1961
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,179
you drop that or you don't have the

1962
01:27:45,179 --> 01:27:48,600
energy to look for more information on

1963
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,940
office networks okay so but this is kind

1964
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,920
of the basic model and it allows you to

1965
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,600
do for instance this kind of thing so

1966
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,239
there's three cities in this very short

1967
01:27:57,239 --> 01:28:00,780
list we drop Singapore and work and they

1968
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:03,480
have these different kind of firms APS

1969
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,000
firm a b c and d and we can could

1970
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,840
imagine a bubble where you say okay and

1971
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:14,159
firm a has a global office in New York

1972
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,040
um a very important office uh or a

1973
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,719
regular office in Singapore and a

1974
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:20,100
regular officer

1975
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,860
and it would be a bit different for b c

1976
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,659
and d okay

1977
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:28,380
so just one example out of thin air

1978
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:32,239
what you can then do is start to measure

1979
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,699
uh the connectivity of cities

1980
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:38,940
thus far we've been talking about

1981
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,440
first

1982
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,020
and what the importance of the city is a

1983
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,780
referral you can also think about what

1984
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:48,360
is now the strength of a city's

1985
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,760
connection based on the on the presence

1986
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,820
of firms so what you do is you basically

1987
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,699
summarize all these different ties

1988
01:28:56,699 --> 01:29:00,540
between cities for one uh for one city

1989
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,000
okay sounds a bit complex but it really

1990
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,540
isn't so what you would do is think

1991
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:09,020
about the connection between different

1992
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,580
cities on the basis of the corporate

1993
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,219
Network so think about five times two

1994
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:17,520
plus five times two would be the

1995
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,159
connectivity generated by first theorem

1996
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:23,400
doesn't be four times two New York would

1997
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:27,719
be five times one uh in addition to that

1998
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:31,560
and two times five and in some you would

1999
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,380
get a figure of 48 that's purely a

2000
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:36,600
relevant example but it would give you

2001
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,139
the highest connectivity in uh in this

2002
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:42,179
model right and then for the other kind

2003
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:44,100
of cities we could do a similar exercise

2004
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,380
for instance

2005
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,060
it wouldn't be generating connectivities

2006
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:50,639
for firm A and D because there's no

2007
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:52,739
presence for these terms so you could

2008
01:29:52,739 --> 01:29:55,800
generate some connectivity or a and for

2009
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,820
C it can also summarize that and what

2010
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,800
you could also do is Express this as a

2011
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,139
proportion of the most connected City in

2012
01:30:04,139 --> 01:30:06,360
this tiny example of New York and you

2013
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,840
would get to say well entrance is four

2014
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,440
tenths connected as well as New York so

2015
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,960
New York is is our leading we're all

2016
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,420
sitting here then we have Singapore and

2017
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:20,540
then enter okay so a very very small

2018
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:24,360
example to tell you how to structure

2019
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:27,360
okay service values thinking about

2020
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,760
connections between cities and then

2021
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,520
summarizing these connections that gives

2022
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,860
us an overall view of the productivity

2023
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:39,540
of a city in the world uh sitting okay

2024
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:43,260
so we have specified the model and then

2025
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,060
you can start measuring it and filling

2026
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,840
it with data

2027
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:52,980
um and how has gork done this well the

2028
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,960
specification obviously refers to the

2029
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,699
aps firms and um and it's kind of nice

2030
01:30:58,699 --> 01:31:01,920
is that this measurement has occurred

2031
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,679
several times since I think 2000 but

2032
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:06,780
every time in the same way so kind of

2033
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:10,199
definitions of uh of categories of this

2034
01:31:10,199 --> 01:31:12,540
kind of APs sectors has remained the

2035
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:15,000
same there has been numerous kind of

2036
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,699
reiterations of these measures so five

2037
01:31:17,699 --> 01:31:19,980
sectors are are connected to substance

2038
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,080
interpretation currency advertising

2039
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,780
Financial Services traditional insurance

2040
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:26,639
law and management consultancy

2041
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,780
basically what God does is the leading

2042
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:35,159
firms 175 verbs based on Forbes and

2043
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:37,340
other kinds of corporate corporate lists

2044
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:40,080
uh that tells something about turnover

2045
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,980
the size of these phrase etc etc uh are

2046
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:46,280
kind of selected

2047
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:50,699
and then what is also done is is yeah

2048
01:31:50,699 --> 01:31:52,620
you could do this with an infinite

2049
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:55,020
number of cities well not infinite but a

2050
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:58,080
very large list of cities but uh to

2051
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,060
avoid a bit of I don't know it's not

2052
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,440
bias but to

2053
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,080
together manageable data set you could

2054
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,080
say the largest cities or what we know

2055
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,940
from certain countries as economically

2056
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,239
important cities are selected in this

2057
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:14,219
list so it's not a purely inductive

2058
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:16,739
exercise it's kind of an informed

2059
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:19,620
decision to include some uh cities and

2060
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:22,080
other colors so a lot of firms a lot of

2061
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,960
cities and then on the basis of

2062
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,780
information uh that we that we can find

2063
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:31,340
on corporate websites we make a decision

2064
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:35,159
as to how important offices are

2065
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:38,280
and then you can basically start uh

2066
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,620
filling an entire Matrix so just an

2067
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:44,580
example uh to to share a bit of how this

2068
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,960
works I mean if you think about just

2069
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,000
look at the website can be quite tough

2070
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,340
but you can actually although a lot of

2071
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:52,560
these websites find very detailed

2072
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,500
information coming at the address level

2073
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:58,260
of uh of these offices and a lot of

2074
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,360
these corporations are very proud that

2075
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,159
they're located in the meeting world

2076
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:05,460
cities kind of a branding so quite often

2077
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:08,659
you can find that yes

2078
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,159
uh yes

2079
01:33:11,159 --> 01:33:13,560
to avoid defenestration that's a very

2080
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,040
good idea

2081
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:19,320
I think yeah I'm not sure whether it's

2082
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:22,199
going to take away all the noise that

2083
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:25,020
that's what you're aiming at

2084
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:27,900
um so yeah so it's um

2085
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:30,000
it's a freely accessible source of

2086
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,800
information

2087
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,080
but obviously

2088
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,620
um it's also a bit of guesswork it needs

2089
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,380
to come up with some kind of

2090
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:42,800
interpretive guide to to reach

2091
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,960
uh these websites and to make decisions

2092
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,719
as to how you will uh give attachive

2093
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:52,860
value to these stories okay just one uh

2094
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:55,260
for example and then you can build this

2095
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,060
kind of matrices

2096
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:00,179
so all the firms in a lot of countries a

2097
01:34:00,179 --> 01:34:02,580
lot of cities and then you can start

2098
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:05,040
applying that problem okay so it's an

2099
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,020
approximation of the importance of

2100
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:09,420
cities in these corporate networks uh

2101
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:11,580
and it has delivered a kind of sustained

2102
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,920
analysis or modeling of these

2103
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:17,580
interactions uh on that basis

2104
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:20,159
and then maybe you already have seen

2105
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,860
this kind of maps so a lot of uh world

2106
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:25,980
city Network research and start to look

2107
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:28,500
uh into the actual geography that we

2108
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,679
produced so this is some research uh

2109
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:33,719
from a while ago

2110
01:34:33,719 --> 01:34:37,320
um it just shows the the absolute levels

2111
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,420
of connectivity so the global network

2112
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:41,880
connectivity and the darker practices

2113
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,360
are the most connected places and then

2114
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,800
uh the lower

2115
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,940
um the lighter colors so it gives you an

2116
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:54,420
idea take a good look at this map

2117
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:56,580
what you learn from that or where you

2118
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:59,940
find striking

2119
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:04,820
anything striking here

2120
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,880
does it confirm what you thought

2121
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,320
you learn new things

2122
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:14,639
yeah

2123
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:16,260
no

2124
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:20,480
yes I am I'm pretty sure

2125
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:25,320
this is the world mapping there are lots

2126
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,360
of human things

2127
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,360
so why are there so many Europeans to be

2128
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:31,800
selected like you said like if you're

2129
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,980
kind of making the largest cities

2130
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,840
in Europe we don't have the largest

2131
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:40,800
number of populations so I I don't think

2132
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,920
no so but it's it's a list uh so this

2133
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,260
there's a number of criteria I mean

2134
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:49,520
population is one but it's also in in

2135
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,620
certain countries I mean uh is also

2136
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:55,199
looking forward to basically with known

2137
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:59,040
economic importance so in Belgium uh it

2138
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,320
would also include Francisco

2139
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,600
uh which is absolutely another two

2140
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,600
million uh inhabitant cities so but we

2141
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,960
know it has important board activities

2142
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,659
just to be clear these are not 525

2143
01:36:12,659 --> 01:36:15,719
cities within selection I think it's 123

2144
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:18,719
so it's focusing on the most connected

2145
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:21,960
cities uh which as a result

2146
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,239
apparently gives

2147
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:27,120
a geography that is skewed towards

2148
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,060
it's a North America Western Europe and

2149
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:34,159
then has a bit of presence elsewhere

2150
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:36,679
yep

2151
01:36:36,679 --> 01:36:40,760
it seems like this

2152
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:43,760
is

2153
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:47,219
like that like there's like a whole lot

2154
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:48,960
of economic relationships that are

2155
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,360
Global that that business like that is

2156
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,060
absolutely a good case relationship

2157
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,679
um you know which like on an individual

2158
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,300
level are probably not put the money but

2159
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,900
like yeah

2160
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:10,139
I I agree 300 so the question is I mean

2161
01:37:10,139 --> 01:37:11,580
does this represent citizen

2162
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:14,280
globalization or does it represent the

2163
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:17,880
location strategies of APs firms and to

2164
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,880
what extent is this the same so it's

2165
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,980
it's the question is to what extent you

2166
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:26,100
go along and they claim that ABS firms

2167
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:28,139
are an indicated species of commandment

2168
01:37:28,139 --> 01:37:29,280
control

2169
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,699
I think to some extent this is the case

2170
01:37:31,699 --> 01:37:34,260
but there's clearly other processes but

2171
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:35,699
I think and that's something that will

2172
01:37:35,699 --> 01:37:39,000
return to later on uh

2173
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,980
we have to I think another key

2174
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:42,780
distinguish between say more economic

2175
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:46,020
geography readings whereas there's also

2176
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:48,000
more urban studies critiques some people

2177
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,199
would say that you're not capturing

2178
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:50,900
globalization here

2179
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,400
and there's other process we should look

2180
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,500
at yes that's true but it doesn't

2181
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,780
discredit one particular reading or one

2182
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,520
particular focus on the process as long

2183
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,080
as we're clear about what it is it

2184
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,820
measures and what it is that it doesn't

2185
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,620
but if I complete the example that

2186
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,300
remittances I'll return to that in a

2187
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,280
second is is

2188
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:11,340
um it's very appropriate so this we have

2189
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,560
to be careful that we that we

2190
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,360
we're not switching to some kind of

2191
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,820
Imperial uh

2192
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:21,780
act here uh to try to claim that one

2193
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:24,120
process dominate something but if we're

2194
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,520
specific we can say something

2195
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,460
same here it's uh the same period That's

2196
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,880
a kind of comparison uh between two

2197
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,580
periods in time if we I mean there was a

2198
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,620
data collection and allows analysis in

2199
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:41,280
2000 and then just before the crisis uh

2200
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,040
in 2008 I mean the previous crisis I

2201
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,320
mean I'm getting old

2202
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,260
um so comparing uh the structure of the

2203
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,000
world city Network which is effectively

2204
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,699
on the aggregate level

2205
01:38:53,699 --> 01:38:56,219
um the structure of corporate strategies

2206
01:38:56,219 --> 01:38:59,280
and their geographies and I mean it's

2207
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,199
kind of interesting to see that even

2208
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:04,139
before uh the euro-american or North

2209
01:39:04,139 --> 01:39:06,420
Atlantic financial crisis there was

2210
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:08,159
already a shift going on in terms of

2211
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,219
strategic importance of cities in the

2212
01:39:11,219 --> 01:39:13,739
East and I mean both in Eastern Europe

2213
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:17,280
and uh the global east so I'm talking

2214
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,040
about uh Chinese cities for instance so

2215
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,199
if for instance we're interested in in

2216
01:39:22,199 --> 01:39:24,540
secular shifts within the structure of

2217
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:27,600
the world economy it shows that it's

2218
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,340
also reflected in the corporate

2219
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:32,040
geographies of these APS firms

2220
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,360
which

2221
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,400
knowing that they're important inputs

2222
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,739
for Global corporations tells us

2223
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:39,780
something about the relevance of these

2224
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:43,440
cities and how Capital circulates on the

2225
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,480
global scale so it tells us something

2226
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,120
that everything and that's also and

2227
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:52,500
that's also why Rob uses heuristic and

2228
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,300
that there's some modestly connected to

2229
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,340
that heuristic is a kind of a starting

2230
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,620
point it's a searching device

2231
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:01,440
when you say oh what the hell is going

2232
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,699
on in

2233
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:04,940
let's say Miami

2234
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:07,980
it's dark red what could be the process

2235
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:11,159
going on how does it explain that how do

2236
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:12,900
you explain that it's one of the worst

2237
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,900
uh performers if you will and lost so

2238
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:17,580
much connectivity where it's a very

2239
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:19,739
important Transit Hub between Latin

2240
01:40:19,739 --> 01:40:23,580
America and a North America

2241
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:27,120
is why is it losing its functions uh is

2242
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,460
it because Latin America is becoming

2243
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:32,639
less important or uh for North American

2244
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:36,060
Capital uh what could be going on there

2245
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,380
I mean you can think about numerous

2246
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:40,560
other examples uh there and it should be

2247
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,360
I think and that's how I personally use

2248
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:45,179
it the starting point for analysis and a

2249
01:40:45,179 --> 01:40:46,620
different set to a different set of

2250
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:49,800
methods you could do a case study

2251
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:52,139
follow the thing follow your nose and

2252
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:54,060
try to problematize these kind of

2253
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:57,360
filings but it's a way to refer to refer

2254
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,699
back to that and it gives you and that's

2255
01:40:59,699 --> 01:41:01,620
I think the added value some kind of

2256
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:04,880
standardized overview

2257
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:06,780
there's a lot of things that's further

2258
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:08,639
that we can say about that

2259
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:09,239
um

2260
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:12,719
I really need to press on uh because

2261
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:14,400
it's taking a bit more time than

2262
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,920
expected are you still okay to proceed I

2263
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,320
promise that we won't take 25 minutes

2264
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,360
but maybe 20 minutes

2265
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,580
if I'm lucky

2266
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,219
is that okay or you want a break

2267
01:41:25,219 --> 01:41:28,520
otherwise it's going to take

2268
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,780
yes you can

2269
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:33,300
um yeah is there a collective need for a

2270
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,000
restroom break

2271
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,760
is that a yes hand okay

2272
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,040
uh yeah two minutes because we really

2273
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,179
because

2274
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:46,199
we can't take too much time so

2275
01:41:46,199 --> 01:41:49,920
if you project that in 20 minutes your

2276
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,739
bladder will break uh go now

2277
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:01,760

[Music]

2308
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:35,520
so yeah just one thing that you should

2309
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,980
appreciate by now a long tradition of

2310
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:40,320
Rural and Global cities research then

2311
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,320
this kind of empirically informative but

2312
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:45,719
at some point and especially the early

2313
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:49,199
2000s there was a danger that or at

2314
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:51,739
least this research agenda was was

2315
01:48:51,739 --> 01:48:54,060
interpreted as you could say dominant or

2316
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:57,480
hegemonic even uh within Urban studies

2317
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:00,179
or citizen globalization and as such it

2318
01:49:00,179 --> 01:49:03,840
also raised quite a bit of criticism

2319
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,179
um and I think it's debatable to what

2320
01:49:06,179 --> 01:49:08,040
extent this is just quite at some points

2321
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,139
it certainly is for the points I think

2322
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:12,480
I'm personally but I'm also kind of

2323
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,940
involved in these debates a bit more in

2324
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:17,100
the wild well just take you through them

2325
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:19,440
uh and I hope to do so within the next

2326
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,540
uh 20 minutes

2327
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:24,960
right uh I think we could say I still

2328
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,719
think that the heuristic can be powerful

2329
01:49:27,719 --> 01:49:29,520
to the map and spatially analyze Global

2330
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,940
Connections but uh clearly something can

2331
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:35,040
be said that I'll just skip that and cut

2332
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,440
the business one of the most important

2333
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,840
uh could be a more most trenching

2334
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,060
critiques was launched at the beginning

2335
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:46,739
of the Northeast by a famous

2336
01:49:46,739 --> 01:49:50,280
um scholar Jennifer Robinson

2337
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,920
um a South African uh working from

2338
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:53,880
London

2339
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:57,719
uh wrote a book uh ordinary cities or

2340
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:00,659
whatever uh papers was

2341
01:50:00,659 --> 01:50:03,239
um world cities or a world of cities

2342
01:50:03,239 --> 01:50:06,119
where she kind of

2343
01:50:06,119 --> 01:50:08,340
um or was a bit frustrated with with

2344
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:11,639
this dominance of world cities uh

2345
01:50:11,639 --> 01:50:13,619
research in the debate about citizen

2346
01:50:13,619 --> 01:50:16,260
globalization and it says she says well

2347
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:17,820
it's quite a different thing to talk

2348
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,560
about world cities or to be interested

2349
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:21,659
in a globalization of cities more widely

2350
01:50:21,659 --> 01:50:24,719
right and that's good reasons for this

2351
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,900
difference or the kind of the lack of of

2352
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:29,820
what role in global cities research was

2353
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:31,739
doing then in addressing cities in

2354
01:50:31,739 --> 01:50:34,800
globalization since and we've seen the

2355
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,500
maps a lot of the cities around the

2356
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,540
globe and especially in the global South

2357
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:41,520
are basically dropped off

2358
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,179
the physical literal map right so we

2359
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:47,460
find that there's a lot of connectivity

2360
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:50,880
in European Western European North

2361
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,340
American Asian cities but there's

2362
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:55,500
actually very little to be told about

2363
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,300
African cities they're basically not

2364
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:59,280
represented police

2365
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,980
so it's an issue of representation there

2366
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:04,219
in her view

2367
01:51:04,219 --> 01:51:07,139
uh but it also deals with

2368
01:51:07,139 --> 01:51:09,719
um with how we conceptualize uh world

2369
01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:13,500
and Globe cities and in her argument

2370
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:16,080
um we've focused too much on a limited

2371
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,719
number of economic processes whereas all

2372
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:21,239
the kind of connections remain unsteady

2373
01:51:21,239 --> 01:51:23,880
and one of the examples that was already

2374
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:25,679
given was yeah you can look at

2375
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,840
remittances and you would get a

2376
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,360
completely different view perhaps

2377
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:33,840
on these Urban Networks

2378
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:36,960
so when her kind of claim is that

2379
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:40,139
by doing so by these say geographical

2380
01:51:40,139 --> 01:51:42,960
conceptual biases World Series research

2381
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,760
has ignored role in position of numerous

2382
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:46,619
ordinary cities in the global economy

2383
01:51:46,619 --> 01:51:49,260
and there's a tendency

2384
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:53,159
to uh you could say offer a eurocentric

2385
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:56,699
global City Theory and then projecting

2386
01:51:56,699 --> 01:52:00,119
that in other areas of the world so a

2387
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:01,860
post-colonial critique

2388
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:04,800
it's concerned with people say power

2389
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,199
relations in the production

2390
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:11,639
of theories and Concepts and how these

2391
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:15,360
Concepts and theories are reproducing

2392
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,760
uh existing inequalities and there's

2393
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:20,400
these are also geographical so it's a

2394
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,260
social spatial and evenness at the

2395
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,940
global scale

2396
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:27,060
we keep on kind of reiterating the

2397
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,580
dominance of certain kinds of activities

2398
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:31,800
come up with certain kind of maps

2399
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,860
measuring things in a certain way in the

2400
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:36,840
end we're part of the process and part

2401
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,480
of the problem if you will

2402
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,340
I think there's certainly an argument

2403
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:43,980
had to be made there

2404
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:46,080
um I think representation is problematic

2405
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:49,199
in my own research that was also kind of

2406
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:51,060
the starting point of why I was

2407
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:53,460
interested in looking into uh Islamic

2408
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:56,159
Finance as a way to understand Middle

2409
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:57,920
Eastern

2410
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,080
uh World City information processes not

2411
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:03,780
to a traditional lens of the classic APS

2412
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:07,199
firms but to look at okay to what extent

2413
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:10,020
or local norms and ethics religious and

2414
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:13,380
other regarding Finance

2415
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:16,560
um giving rice to a global sector and

2416
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:19,020
that's in and of its own that could then

2417
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:21,139
also start allow us to unpack

2418
01:53:21,139 --> 01:53:23,400
inter-urban connections that was kind of

2419
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:25,920
what I did in my uh my own work on

2420
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:28,860
Islamic Finance so I I certainly am

2421
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:31,320
extremely sensitive uh to this outcome

2422
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:34,739
but at the same time we also have to uh

2423
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:36,719
be clear that that part of this

2424
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:39,600
criticism perhaps also out of place I

2425
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,760
think uh Jennifer Robinson really starts

2426
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:44,100
from an urban studies critique and she

2427
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:46,199
wants to understand

2428
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:48,300
um you could say globalization and its

2429
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:50,400
plurality not just economic but

2430
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,380
otherwise and even within economic

2431
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:56,400
processes why diversity whereas for gork

2432
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,860
I think the purpose is how can we

2433
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:00,780
understand the reproduction of uneven

2434
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:02,699
development on a global scale at least

2435
01:54:02,699 --> 01:54:06,239
in the freedomanian tradition where it

2436
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:07,260
was about

2437
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:10,020
how can we explain it indeed the fact

2438
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,360
that that there's still under

2439
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:15,480
development in Andre the Frank's terms

2440
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:18,060
in in the global South does it have

2441
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:19,679
something to do with the supporting the

2442
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:22,679
position of these cities and macro

2443
01:54:22,679 --> 01:54:25,920
processes macro macro capitalist process

2444
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,920
so is it something with

2445
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:31,500
the extraction of value organized

2446
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,060
through these corporate networks and

2447
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:35,040
supported by its APS firms that actually

2448
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:37,560
explains why these cities are not on the

2449
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:40,020
map so is this a result

2450
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:43,500
uh is this not a neglect on this place

2451
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,060
it's the fact that these places are not

2452
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:47,580
represented means they're either

2453
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:50,219
bypassed by these core protectors or

2454
01:54:50,219 --> 01:54:51,600
that they potentially are are

2455
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,520
subordinating in this process

2456
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,619
which could then be a question of is

2457
01:54:55,619 --> 01:54:57,139
this really the case

2458
01:54:57,139 --> 01:55:00,060
uh can we look into this processor so

2459
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:02,460
sometimes a bit of a confusion I think

2460
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:05,340
uh between kind of a deliberate choice

2461
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:08,159
not to include certain places whereas

2462
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:09,600
some of these maps are actually to be

2463
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:11,880
taken as as a result of a critical

2464
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:13,440
analysis

2465
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:17,400
I do agree that in a number of you could

2466
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:19,320
say analysis that are more technical in

2467
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:21,960
nature uh in terms of the world city

2468
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,300
Network this kind of critical Edge was

2469
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:26,639
sometimes lost and there's a kind of a

2470
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,980
mission drift towards mapping networks

2471
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:30,900
whereas the connection to process of

2472
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:33,060
uneven development was less clear that's

2473
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:34,800
a bit of my personal

2474
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,159
uh crusade to um to make the connection

2475
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:41,639
uh to the Critical Agenda again so this

2476
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:43,619
but certainly

2477
01:55:43,619 --> 01:55:46,020
um Jennifer Robertson points us to to be

2478
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:49,080
very clear about what it is that we are

2479
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:51,179
measuring through this kind of goal

2480
01:55:51,179 --> 01:55:52,920
analysis and what we're not so it's

2481
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:55,619
about placing them these kind of methods

2482
01:55:55,619 --> 01:55:59,520
in a wider uh you could say firmament of

2483
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:04,199
of methods uh two to work with that

2484
01:56:04,199 --> 01:56:06,540
now it does also connect to what kind of

2485
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:09,840
practice uh we which we wish to endorse

2486
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:12,540
within the tradition of urban studies

2487
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:15,420
in the sense that uh and this is kind of

2488
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:16,679
our

2489
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:18,739
um or my personal

2490
01:56:18,739 --> 01:56:21,060
disappointment with a lot of research

2491
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:23,760
that has followed the work by Jennifer

2492
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:27,119
Robinson from the South but there's a

2493
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:29,100
lot of tendency with weird rich Jennifer

2494
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:33,860
or Jenny uh and a very reductionist

2495
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:36,239
representation of her legitimate claims

2496
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,159
claims and we we actually wrote a paper

2497
01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:41,460
about this with the egregious title uh

2498
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:44,760
kind of straw man speak uh where we kind

2499
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,440
of deal with

2500
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:48,540
um with distilling what is kind of

2501
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:50,699
Justified criticism and where we think

2502
01:56:50,699 --> 01:56:53,219
it's a bit too much and what we

2503
01:56:53,219 --> 01:56:56,460
particularly regrets is that some of

2504
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:58,639
this criticism has led to

2505
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:02,100
disengaged or polemic pluralism where

2506
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:04,380
it's a kind of rejection certain agendas

2507
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:07,020
to do something else without taking

2508
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,060
stock about of the knowledge that is

2509
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:12,239
produced there so what we try to then

2510
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:13,980
propose is some kind of a middle ground

2511
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:17,280
is a more engaged form of urban studies

2512
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,900
debate which also means that you can say

2513
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:21,139
yes

2514
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:23,580
like analysis analysis or relatively

2515
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:25,619
research in general

2516
01:57:25,619 --> 01:57:27,719
we need to put it in its place but it

2517
01:57:27,719 --> 01:57:29,219
doesn't mean that we can try to work

2518
01:57:29,219 --> 01:57:31,260
with this Concepts to make sense of

2519
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:32,599
places

2520
01:57:32,599 --> 01:57:35,760
beyond the short list of world cities

2521
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,500
could be that I'm babbling and I'm

2522
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,780
defending on explaining myself in

2523
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:41,520
different kind of ways in unnecessary

2524
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,860
ways but let me try to make it more

2525
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:49,139
clear uh you can say ah Beirut Manila we

2526
01:57:49,139 --> 01:57:52,260
don't need a world city Concepts it's uh

2527
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:54,420
well the world city is a euro-american

2528
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:58,080
invention can't do anything with that

2529
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:59,940
uh it could be something that you could

2530
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:02,820
say uh they say yeah we need the concept

2531
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:04,679
of the middle eastern city of the Asian

2532
01:58:04,679 --> 01:58:06,420
City because everything is particular

2533
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:09,840
and then we need to build that theory uh

2534
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,699
and then it's so unique and particular

2535
01:58:11,699 --> 01:58:13,619
that you you can't do anything

2536
01:58:13,619 --> 01:58:15,119
so

2537
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:18,599
people disagree and say look

2538
01:58:18,599 --> 01:58:21,480
there's no one-on-one projection of

2539
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:24,780
world city formation as a process on a

2540
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:27,800
city like Beirut for instance or Manila

2541
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:30,360
uh but we'll have to work with the

2542
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:32,340
concept to see to an extent it does

2543
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:34,020
explain something of what we find and

2544
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:36,360
what extent it doesn't and perhaps we

2545
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:41,659
need to enhance or tailor uh diversify

2546
01:58:41,659 --> 01:58:43,739
the concepts

2547
01:58:43,739 --> 01:58:46,080
and in the process we potentially may

2548
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,880
even learn something about the place

2549
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:50,880
that we we study but at least we still

2550
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,040
remain in a position that we can speak

2551
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,739
back to the original debate which is I

2552
01:58:55,739 --> 01:58:57,540
think the point of urban studies that

2553
01:58:57,540 --> 01:58:59,340
were not Lost in Translation but try to

2554
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:03,060
connect to some kind of organized or

2555
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:05,159
overarching debate even if you're

2556
01:59:05,159 --> 01:59:08,520
studying in very diverse places

2557
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,619
now yeah I won't say too much about

2558
01:59:10,619 --> 01:59:12,480
these two cases because it's also part

2559
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,639
of our discussion seminar but just to

2560
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:16,920
point down the kind of contrasting cases

2561
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:20,280
uh so in one paper we looked at Beirut

2562
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:22,440
um which is kind of an interesting place

2563
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:26,280
I mean we call it a city more by X path

2564
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:29,040
uh we're also the formation processes so

2565
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:32,340
what you see is a built environment uh

2566
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:34,380
with skyscrapers

2567
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:36,420
um they obviously took a hit and are

2568
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:40,020
taking a serious hit uh currently uh

2569
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:41,940
with the the entire term of the country

2570
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:43,860
isn't

2571
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:45,840
um but on the first side you would say

2572
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:47,760
okay there's actually when you start

2573
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:50,040
looking at APS activities it's actually

2574
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,320
very little going on there there's a lot

2575
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,719
of very little Regional headquarters

2576
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:56,820
there's very little International firms

2577
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:59,340
but when you then start looking into yes

2578
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:02,699
remittance flows or and and the diaspora

2579
02:00:02,699 --> 02:00:04,560
you find that almost one-fifth of

2580
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:07,199
Lebanese economy is made of out of these

2581
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:09,360
remittances and a lot of it braces back

2582
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:12,060
to ABS professionals that are located in

2583
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:15,440
the Gulf so it's our it's our McKinsey

2584
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:18,900
trained pedigree Consultants McKinsey

2585
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:21,480
Liberty that is then advising the Saudis

2586
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:23,760
or people in Dubai the Elites in Dubai

2587
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,699
that earn their money there uh send back

2588
02:00:26,699 --> 02:00:30,780
their money and buy a hugely overpriced

2589
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:34,460
apartment in the city center of Beirut

2590
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:36,840
at the real estate market which is then

2591
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:40,500
kept artificially booming by almost free

2592
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:42,480
credits from the Central Bank of Lebanon

2593
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:45,060
which is also the personal property of

2594
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:47,400
the living families of

2595
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:51,599
um of Lebanon so it's kind of connected

2596
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:54,060
um now in any case uh it shows you that

2597
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:57,420
if you follow your nose in a sense there

2598
02:00:57,420 --> 02:00:59,880
still are some characteristics of world

2599
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:02,699
city formation especially in the role of

2600
02:01:02,699 --> 02:01:05,580
high skilled labor but it's a kind of

2601
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:07,920
it's it's an impressive Regional

2602
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,360
capacity building

2603
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:12,900
Regional uh circuits of value that are

2604
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:15,420
kind of connected back to the city

2605
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:17,580
yeah

2606
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:19,080
um so it's function as a kind of a

2607
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,420
capital city to the region rather than

2608
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:24,360
as a kind of server service deliveries

2609
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:26,760
if you look at Manila it's kind of the

2610
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:28,860
opposite you'd say wow a lot of

2611
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:30,900
activities there a lot of APs firms

2612
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:33,599
they're all there but then you when you

2613
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:35,340
start looking into these activities and

2614
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:36,840
there's something that Rihanna gleibert

2615
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,040
has done

2616
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,980
it's basically part of the largest one

2617
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:42,900
of the largest Outsourcing sectors of

2618
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:45,840
Tendencies uh that you find so a lot of

2619
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,719
back office activities for Global Banks

2620
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:51,360
and other kind of service providers but

2621
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:54,360
it's not really command and control or

2622
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:57,020
not at least not what we think of it

2623
02:01:57,020 --> 02:02:00,840
and it may also work through and what it

2624
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:02,580
can explain in terms of the segmentation

2625
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:04,380
of the labor market but because it would

2626
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:07,380
not be high-end managers that are then

2627
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:10,020
gentrifying neighborhoods

2628
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:11,760
but it may give rise through a middle

2629
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:14,040
class or something so it may result in

2630
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:16,920
other kinds of Labor Market structures

2631
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:19,320
but at least we can still refer back to

2632
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:21,179
world cities and start comparing to what

2633
02:02:21,179 --> 02:02:22,139
is going on

2634
02:02:22,139 --> 02:02:24,179
so this is an example of an income

2635
02:02:24,179 --> 02:02:27,500
passing approach to try to encompass

2636
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:29,880
diversity in your research design and

2637
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:32,040
try to make sense of it okay so that's

2638
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,179
how we solve it I won't say anything

2639
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:34,860
more because I want to leave something

2640
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:38,699
for the debating session

2641
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:42,900
second uh point of criticism is uh

2642
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:45,360
social constructivist critique

2643
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,639
um again a bit the same in the sense

2644
02:02:47,639 --> 02:02:51,840
that representation matters and this is

2645
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:56,400
the great work by Dory Massey uh who was

2646
02:02:56,400 --> 02:03:00,659
a uh trying to say nice economic

2647
02:03:00,659 --> 02:03:04,040
geographer from the UK

2648
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,280
um

2649
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:07,320
thought about spatial divisions of labor

2650
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:09,599
was one of the leading voices and and a

2651
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:11,820
lot of progressive debates uh in

2652
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:13,920
geography

2653
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:16,199
um and she also wrote a book

2654
02:03:16,199 --> 02:03:19,619
world city in 2007 uh where she kind of

2655
02:03:19,619 --> 02:03:23,580
engaged with with this agenda

2656
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:24,780
and

2657
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:26,880
um what she basically says in this book

2658
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,560
is

2659
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,360
um yeah

2660
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:31,139
um

2661
02:03:31,139 --> 02:03:35,280
world cities are not just a given an

2662
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:38,460
economic geographical reality based on

2663
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:41,340
as we set the clustering of these abs

2664
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:44,040
firms their labor markets Etc

2665
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:46,739
but they are but they're also a product

2666
02:03:46,739 --> 02:03:51,840
of uh discourses representation

2667
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:55,560
etc etc so they're mediated by political

2668
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:57,599
interests

2669
02:03:57,599 --> 02:04:01,500
um Elites others and other actors that

2670
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:04,679
project certain discourses about world

2671
02:04:04,679 --> 02:04:07,080
and Global cities and these also have

2672
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:10,679
ultimately uh performative effects so

2673
02:04:10,679 --> 02:04:13,199
they they produce or co-produce certain

2674
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:15,659
realities okay so that's kind of

2675
02:04:15,659 --> 02:04:18,440
knowledge Theory so the world

2676
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:21,719
is also to some extent shaped by how you

2677
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:24,599
represent this and then you can can be

2678
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:27,060
an Ardent very strong believer of that

2679
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:29,000
and say okay the world is almost

2680
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,139
exclusively reducible to how we

2681
02:04:31,139 --> 02:04:33,119
represented whereas others would work

2682
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:35,280
more in the kind of materials fragrance

2683
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,199
okay not everything is shaped by words

2684
02:04:37,199 --> 02:04:39,920
right so

2685
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:44,159
something to think about at what extent

2686
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:47,040
Rapid Station actually matters now

2687
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:50,820
during uh explains this for London

2688
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:52,679
and she says yes it's a globalized

2689
02:04:52,679 --> 02:04:54,900
financial center but the way we perceive

2690
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:56,460
it and the way the city reproduces

2691
02:04:56,460 --> 02:04:59,699
itself is the outcome of a decade-long

2692
02:04:59,699 --> 02:05:02,159
battle of representation which was led

2693
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:04,800
by dominant Financial Elites politicians

2694
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:08,460
not often uh not seldomly connected to

2695
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:10,800
all boys networks that have been

2696
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:13,020
projecting the world city status of

2697
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:15,420
London and this has become some kind of

2698
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:17,659
a hegemonic

2699
02:05:17,659 --> 02:05:20,940
unquestioned uh neoliberal growth

2700
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:23,520
strategy okay it has been part of that

2701
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:26,520
neoliberal strategy since uh the 80s and

2702
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:28,980
the kind of ideas that what is good for

2703
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:31,619
the financial industry is good for the

2704
02:05:31,619 --> 02:05:33,179
city what's good for the city is good

2705
02:05:33,179 --> 02:05:34,920
for London not good for London it's good

2706
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:37,199
for the southeast of England

2707
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:38,880
what is good for the Saudis is good for

2708
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:42,060
the UK and uh dear Europeans with good

2709
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:44,940
what is good for the UK is also good for

2710
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:48,300
Europe so please deregulate Finance

2711
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:52,139
so it's a rhetorical strategy she calls

2712
02:05:52,139 --> 02:05:56,280
uh the passport Toto where the park is

2713
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,679
there to represent the whole so it's the

2714
02:05:58,679 --> 02:06:00,780
interests of the city of London which

2715
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:03,239
are projected to be the interests of the

2716
02:06:03,239 --> 02:06:06,900
UK citizen and again as brexit has shown

2717
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:10,560
this has been quite uh radically uh

2718
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,080
rejected again

2719
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,040
um

2720
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:18,020
whether legitimately or not

2721
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:20,760
um so yeah there's this neoliberal

2722
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:22,619
growth strategy and it also was

2723
02:06:22,619 --> 02:06:24,900
connected to a legitimate legitimized

2724
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:27,239
certain material decisions in the sense

2725
02:06:27,239 --> 02:06:28,020
that

2726
02:06:28,020 --> 02:06:30,960
if you look at this course is about does

2727
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:34,440
hydro need a new uh Runway because of

2728
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:38,340
capacity issues yes London cannot uh

2729
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:40,739
keep up with its Global City status or

2730
02:06:40,739 --> 02:06:42,840
it cannot grow it its connection to new

2731
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:45,599
Emerging Markets if it doesn't have an

2732
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:48,980
extra Runway so please neighbors

2733
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:51,800
go away or

2734
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:54,900
needle your ears

2735
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:57,239
um but we absolutely need this and

2736
02:06:57,239 --> 02:06:59,400
Global City discourse is there to

2737
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:01,679
justify that but also when you look at

2738
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:03,719
the Restriction of the UK economy and

2739
02:07:03,719 --> 02:07:07,380
70s and 80s I mean closing the mines etc

2740
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:10,139
etc and this has produced very uneven

2741
02:07:10,139 --> 02:07:12,480
outcomes in the UK a lot of cities in

2742
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,280
the north and hope mining areas

2743
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:17,580
industrial areas saw a decline and at

2744
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:19,020
that point what would have been

2745
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:22,440
interesting is low interest rates or

2746
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:24,480
that could boost investment to

2747
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:26,820
restructure these peripheral economies

2748
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:29,580
that didn't happen at that point there

2749
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:31,619
was an inflation there was high interest

2750
02:07:31,619 --> 02:07:33,540
rates which made

2751
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:36,920
but simply money very expensive

2752
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:39,840
and which made that it was very hard to

2753
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,699
seek investment in these areas and

2754
02:07:41,699 --> 02:07:43,199
obviously this was in the interest of

2755
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:45,900
the southeast which generated an influx

2756
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:48,780
into Financial Services Etc which then

2757
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:52,739
further grew a global City London so

2758
02:07:52,739 --> 02:07:55,080
it's a particular political agenda that

2759
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:58,139
is behind there that has produced there

2760
02:07:58,139 --> 02:08:01,500
another final point that we us as

2761
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:04,440
academics or academics to be are not

2762
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:07,739
neutral bystanders and her claim is that

2763
02:08:07,739 --> 02:08:09,060
especially when you start looking at

2764
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:11,400
these world city rankings

2765
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:15,000
um that Gog is claimed to produce this

2766
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,520
is part of the problem it's kind of

2767
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:19,860
fueling the self-fulfilling prophecy is

2768
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:23,460
giving people in the city of London

2769
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:25,560
the instruments and the exhibits to say

2770
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:28,860
look uh we're still the leading City but

2771
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:31,860
Dubai is closing please come on we need

2772
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:34,500
further investment uh in the city or we

2773
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,000
need the regulation or something like

2774
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,679
that

2775
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:39,599
um so that's kind of for also attention

2776
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:41,940
critique and sense that yes

2777
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:44,340
um world cities research is performative

2778
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:46,739
in that sense

2779
02:08:46,739 --> 02:08:49,860
so yeah uh just a few uh slides there

2780
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:53,040
and I'll return to that I mean the

2781
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:55,679
pictures that we have of representations

2782
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:58,139
that we have of London

2783
02:08:58,139 --> 02:09:00,960
um are the Blitzen Glam quite often and

2784
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:04,500
it's typically the city but then how

2785
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:06,840
cities kept the city of Lomas kept

2786
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:08,460
working or the wise much important area

2787
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:10,920
remains often undiscussed but that's

2788
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:12,900
something that we'll talk about next

2789
02:09:12,900 --> 02:09:14,219
week

2790
02:09:14,219 --> 02:09:15,000
um

2791
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,699
yeah and this is kind of uh Battle of

2792
02:09:17,699 --> 02:09:19,800
representation is ongoing this is a bit

2793
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:23,159
of a dated figure it's still with uh uh

2794
02:09:23,159 --> 02:09:25,440
with Theresa May there who I was going

2795
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:28,380
for a global Britain agenda uh and again

2796
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:30,540
you see that yeah

2797
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:31,380
um

2798
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:34,500
uh this kind of City Elite is trying to

2799
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:37,139
push it in the the whole campaign in a

2800
02:09:37,139 --> 02:09:41,219
certain way uh threatening to leave

2801
02:09:41,219 --> 02:09:43,739
um rapidly in the city of London which

2802
02:09:43,739 --> 02:09:45,480
would then impact you could say the

2803
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:49,080
global City status of of that City okay

2804
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:50,940
so it's kind of still the same

2805
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:54,599
repertoire that is being used uh at

2806
02:09:54,599 --> 02:09:57,659
times when when brexit was was still uh

2807
02:09:57,659 --> 02:09:59,820
unfinished business

2808
02:09:59,820 --> 02:10:01,800
it's probably not still not unfinished

2809
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:05,880
business but voila now I think uh and

2810
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:07,400
then I really almost had to close

2811
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:09,540
performativity is a very important

2812
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:11,219
criticism that's something that we

2813
02:10:11,219 --> 02:10:12,960
should be very reflexive about it

2814
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,000
basically means

2815
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,699
the insights that you produce kind of

2816
02:10:17,699 --> 02:10:19,260
figures that you produce the maps that

2817
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:21,239
you produce to what extent do they shape

2818
02:10:21,239 --> 02:10:24,119
and impact reality to an extent are they

2819
02:10:24,119 --> 02:10:26,340
picked up what is the responsibility of

2820
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:30,300
a researcher to keep ownership over his

2821
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:33,300
or her results

2822
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:35,580
do we have an impact of that and it's

2823
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:37,080
something that that is also very

2824
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:38,940
important to reflect on in relation to

2825
02:10:38,940 --> 02:10:41,340
world cities and Global cities

2826
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:44,040
and there I think my personal stance is

2827
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:47,040
that we should probably not exaggerate

2828
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:49,739
the influence of world and Global cities

2829
02:10:49,739 --> 02:10:52,139
research in the sense that it's only

2830
02:10:52,139 --> 02:10:56,099
part of a much wider phenomenon of of

2831
02:10:56,099 --> 02:10:59,340
City rankings etc etc and actually when

2832
02:10:59,340 --> 02:11:01,199
you start looking at it it's often the

2833
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:03,719
ABS firms themselves that come up with

2834
02:11:03,719 --> 02:11:06,000
all kinds of rankings another much more

2835
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,239
picked up in popular debates by

2836
02:11:09,239 --> 02:11:12,599
politicians that want to gain uh

2837
02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:16,139
a world in global City status rather

2838
02:11:16,139 --> 02:11:19,980
than referring to go in and of itself I

2839
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:21,420
mean it would be a pleasure to actually

2840
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:23,580
know that people read academic papers

2841
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:26,159
but I think it's actually quite quite

2842
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:28,199
limited so yes we need to be reflexive

2843
02:11:28,199 --> 02:11:30,239
about that but at the same time it could

2844
02:11:30,239 --> 02:11:32,580
maybe a little bit overblown and

2845
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:35,219
rankings are produced uh probably by

2846
02:11:35,219 --> 02:11:37,820
other facts

2847
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:41,580
um I'm sorry to run through this another

2848
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:42,870
point is

2849
02:11:42,870 --> 02:11:43,380
[Music]

2850
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:44,460
um

2851
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:48,540
and a criticism a criticism that deals

2852
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:50,940
with uh to what extent

2853
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:52,980
uh world and Global cities takes into

2854
02:11:52,980 --> 02:11:56,040
account you could say political economy

2855
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:59,639
um processes or the politics of global

2856
02:11:59,639 --> 02:12:01,440
City formation and I think that connects

2857
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:03,599
uh to the work of

2858
02:12:03,599 --> 02:12:06,060
um of Doreen Massey

2859
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:08,340
um and it's a kind of an agenda that was

2860
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:10,080
pushed by new Brenner especially at the

2861
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:12,360
high at the end of the 1990s

2862
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:14,520
and he says well it's not just economic

2863
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,260
geographies it's not just agglomerations

2864
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:19,320
cluster etc etc uh what we need to

2865
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:21,300
account for is the restructuring of the

2866
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:22,280
economy

2867
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:25,860
and what he says a rescaling of the

2868
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:27,300
nation state

2869
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:30,360
so the way uh capitalism is being

2870
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:33,360
governed is not exclusively at the

2871
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:35,099
national scale but something is

2872
02:12:35,099 --> 02:12:36,540
happening with that at the same time

2873
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:38,760
it's becoming supranational so you get

2874
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:40,320
all kinds of international organizations

2875
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:43,980
IMF oecd etc etc in Europe we have

2876
02:12:43,980 --> 02:12:45,560
European Union that starts to

2877
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:49,619
increasingly govern uh the economy and

2878
02:12:49,619 --> 02:12:51,260
at the same time there's a kind of

2879
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:54,659
devolution growth and the importance of

2880
02:12:54,659 --> 02:12:57,480
regions of cities as governance layers

2881
02:12:57,480 --> 02:12:59,940
and some kind of kind of a hollowing out

2882
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:02,880
of the national level so in the words of

2883
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:04,500
of you know Brenner it talks about

2884
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:06,960
globalization as the undoing of the

2885
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:09,480
state whether as the re-specialization

2886
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:12,000
or re-territorialization of the state

2887
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,460
where it attaches itself to new spatial

2888
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:16,739
layers and it calls these new state

2889
02:13:16,739 --> 02:13:19,739
spaces uh to which you have new kinds of

2890
02:13:19,739 --> 02:13:22,800
all kinds of new state projects growth

2891
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,900
projects so

2892
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:27,060
to summarize that seems a bit complex

2893
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:30,179
but there's a shift in in how National

2894
02:13:30,179 --> 02:13:32,940
economies are being managed in terms of

2895
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:35,219
spatial scales it's also happening in a

2896
02:13:35,219 --> 02:13:37,079
much more entrepreneurial way and I'll

2897
02:13:37,079 --> 02:13:40,440
say more that about that next week

2898
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:42,540
but the point is that this these are

2899
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:45,420
politically negotiated processes

2900
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:47,579
and you can have a look at at this

2901
02:13:47,579 --> 02:13:49,619
overview slide uh to the kind of

2902
02:13:49,619 --> 02:13:52,020
detailed uh process that are going on

2903
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:55,020
there but just to give one example they

2904
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:57,840
also kind of gave last week Brussels is

2905
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,360
kind of in this

2906
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:01,920
straight jacket of the Brussels Capital

2907
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:04,800
Region whereas it doesn't

2908
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:05,579
um

2909
02:14:05,579 --> 02:14:08,639
refer to the spatial scale of the actual

2910
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:10,800
metropolitan area or the economic weight

2911
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:11,880
of

2912
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:13,679
of the city

2913
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:15,960
whereas in other context you see the

2914
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:18,000
formation of

2915
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,340
um of the larger metropolitan areas as

2916
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:23,579
governance structures where Global City

2917
02:14:23,579 --> 02:14:25,860
from the foot is now trying to put a

2918
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:27,500
high in life

2919
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:31,639
it's a kind of more Global City region

2920
02:14:31,639 --> 02:14:34,139
organization which has its own

2921
02:14:34,139 --> 02:14:36,780
governance structure etc etc so there is

2922
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:40,619
easier to appreciated than that emerges

2923
02:14:40,619 --> 02:14:42,900
when you compare that to Brussels so

2924
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:45,420
it's it's a rescaling process and you

2925
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:48,179
see that in a lot of European contexts

2926
02:14:48,179 --> 02:14:51,719
not seldomly also kind of pushed for by

2927
02:14:51,719 --> 02:14:54,060
the European Union who likes to see

2928
02:14:54,060 --> 02:14:57,480
the Europe of regions it's kind of this

2929
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:00,540
idea that you need larger entities

2930
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:01,260
um

2931
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:05,520
city regions or regions to to kind of uh

2932
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,159
take control over upscale economic

2933
02:15:08,159 --> 02:15:09,599
processes

2934
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:12,540
so yeah a sensitivity to how the states

2935
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:15,060
spatially reorganized itself to an

2936
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:17,460
extent there's new governance layers to

2937
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:19,500
manage also these economic processes

2938
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:21,900
that was kind of also added to the

2939
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:24,360
debate and then finally very final

2940
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:27,840
slides is and it's kind of a critique or

2941
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:29,159
a criticism

2942
02:15:29,159 --> 02:15:30,719
buy

2943
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:32,760
um where people working in the realm of

2944
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:34,820
financialization

2945
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:38,040
I'll say much more about that if you

2946
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:39,060
take the economic and financial

2947
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:40,980
geography course it's

2948
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:43,679
it's all about financialization but just

2949
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:45,780
the point of the fact that

2950
02:15:45,780 --> 02:15:46,880
um

2951
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:50,520
criticism deals with what it is that is

2952
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:53,579
going on in world cities so it doesn't

2953
02:15:53,579 --> 02:15:57,420
really uh criticize the relevance of

2954
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:00,300
command and control practices in world

2955
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:02,219
and Global cities but it says that

2956
02:16:02,219 --> 02:16:04,320
perhaps the nature of these activities

2957
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:07,199
has transformed over the past 20 or 30

2958
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:09,060
years

2959
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:12,540
so financialization what does it mean it

2960
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:15,960
means that an increasing part of uh

2961
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:19,199
economic processes or value-based

2962
02:16:19,199 --> 02:16:21,360
processes or profits generating process

2963
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,099
not occurring you could say in

2964
02:16:23,099 --> 02:16:24,900
productive activities but is somehow

2965
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:27,119
connected to financial circuits so

2966
02:16:27,119 --> 02:16:30,659
financial investments is by owning

2967
02:16:30,659 --> 02:16:32,519
Financial assets rather than actually

2968
02:16:32,519 --> 02:16:36,120
producing something uh that uh that

2969
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:38,459
people get rich and it also explains a

2970
02:16:38,459 --> 02:16:41,280
runaway inequalities between those who

2971
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:44,218
have large uh huge amounts of wealth and

2972
02:16:44,218 --> 02:16:47,879
others who who rely on their labor but

2973
02:16:47,879 --> 02:16:49,558
we'll say something about that next week

2974
02:16:49,558 --> 02:16:52,620
so financialization also means that

2975
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:54,599
there's a lot of pressure on

2976
02:16:54,599 --> 02:16:56,099
corporations

2977
02:16:56,099 --> 02:16:59,519
two generate returns for financial

2978
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:01,799
investors so it's not just about

2979
02:17:01,799 --> 02:17:04,138
competing with other capitalists too to

2980
02:17:04,138 --> 02:17:06,718
be the most efficient car producer of

2981
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:09,780
cookie manufacturers it's also to do so

2982
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:12,359
to generate as much shareholder value

2983
02:17:12,359 --> 02:17:14,519
compared to your to your competitors

2984
02:17:14,519 --> 02:17:17,519
it's one I mean this kind of called

2985
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:19,260
corporate financialization it's the

2986
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:21,478
restructuring of Corporations so that

2987
02:17:21,478 --> 02:17:23,160
the shareholder value is actually being

2988
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:24,660
created

2989
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:25,978
so

2990
02:17:25,978 --> 02:17:29,218
perhaps world cities are still about

2991
02:17:29,218 --> 02:17:33,058
seamless service for globalization so

2992
02:17:33,058 --> 02:17:34,558
the management of Global Production

2993
02:17:34,558 --> 02:17:37,379
processes networks but this other side

2994
02:17:37,379 --> 02:17:39,359
financial markets perhaps needs to be

2995
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:42,000
taken much more seriously and these abs

2996
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,099
firms may be more and borrowed and

2997
02:17:44,099 --> 02:17:47,218
Loyals and process of financialization

2998
02:17:47,218 --> 02:17:51,478
rather than productivist logics

2999
02:17:51,478 --> 02:17:52,620
um

3000
02:17:52,620 --> 02:17:55,740
so yeah just uh wait

3001
02:17:55,740 --> 02:17:58,439
um so yeah and I think

3002
02:17:58,439 --> 02:18:00,478
um this is what I say here World Series

3003
02:18:00,478 --> 02:18:02,760
may become like obligatory passage

3004
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:05,099
points for other reasons than the ones

3005
02:18:05,099 --> 02:18:07,500
that have been assumed uh already and

3006
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:10,138
that's why uh in one paper we talk about

3007
02:18:10,138 --> 02:18:13,320
an augmented world city uh hypothesis

3008
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:16,340
it's not just about generating value

3009
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:19,080
from productive activities but it's also

3010
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:21,780
about extracting value to rent

3011
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:24,420
extraction practices from those global

3012
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:27,058
production networks and you can see that

3013
02:18:27,058 --> 02:18:28,920
for instance when when you see how

3014
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:31,920
corporations attract funding uh you need

3015
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:36,179
a whole uh amalgamation of of connected

3016
02:18:36,179 --> 02:18:39,718
ABS firms to issue in this case a Euro

3017
02:18:39,718 --> 02:18:42,299
law which is some kind of an offshore uh

3018
02:18:42,299 --> 02:18:46,920
investment instrument and this is a um a

3019
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:49,398
firm a real estate Corporation

3020
02:18:49,398 --> 02:18:52,260
Northern Germany and it's kind of face

3021
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:56,398
all these people to issue debt on a

3022
02:18:56,398 --> 02:18:58,500
global scale so to finance Its Real

3023
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:01,920
Estate projects in Germany so world

3024
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:04,859
cities are mobilized to attract funding

3025
02:19:04,859 --> 02:19:07,679
and to optimize that in a particular way

3026
02:19:07,679 --> 02:19:10,019
the same thing happens when you look at

3027
02:19:10,019 --> 02:19:12,420
the other side of the equation when

3028
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:15,000
value has been produced the point is

3029
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,620
that you

3030
02:19:16,620 --> 02:19:19,740
limit the taxes that you have to pay on

3031
02:19:19,740 --> 02:19:23,120
your Surplus value otherwise

3032
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:25,260
shareholders won't be pleased and you're

3033
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:27,540
competing with other firms to pay as

3034
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:30,179
much shareholder value as possible and

3035
02:19:30,179 --> 02:19:32,700
this is a classic example by Google who

3036
02:19:32,700 --> 02:19:36,120
is using a double dutch Irish sandwich

3037
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:38,459
to um

3038
02:19:38,459 --> 02:19:40,500
yeah to make sure that it's it's

3039
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:43,978
minimizes its its uh its its taxes right

3040
02:19:43,978 --> 02:19:44,820
so

3041
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:46,859
it puts I mean I studied the details and

3042
02:19:46,859 --> 02:19:48,599
I actually don't know them by heart but

3043
02:19:48,599 --> 02:19:51,479
places some intellectual property in

3044
02:19:51,479 --> 02:19:53,939
Ireland and that fermented through the

3045
02:19:53,939 --> 02:19:56,040
Netherlands goes back to Ireland and

3046
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:58,979
then it passes through the Caribbean

3047
02:19:58,979 --> 02:20:01,439
um uh to optimize that circuit and this

3048
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:03,020
is also something that firms like

3049
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:06,120
Deloitte and law firms are also engaged

3050
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:09,120
so it's the optimization of these kind

3051
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:11,399
of financial structures uh amidst

3052
02:20:11,399 --> 02:20:13,500
financialization is also a very

3053
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:16,740
important function of world cities so in

3054
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:17,880
the end

3055
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:20,399
I think to summarize the picture it's

3056
02:20:20,399 --> 02:20:21,960
about

3057
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:24,180
um you could say representation you

3058
02:20:24,180 --> 02:20:25,740
could think about

3059
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:30,140
um world cities as kind of Mount Everest

3060
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:33,479
agglomerations of wealth that is being

3061
02:20:33,479 --> 02:20:35,760
generated and then will then spill over

3062
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:38,340
across the territory but you can also

3063
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:41,100
think about uh how's it called in

3064
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:44,520
English the Marian deaths 11 kilometers

3065
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:48,359
deep uh where a value that is being

3066
02:20:48,359 --> 02:20:51,180
produced elsewhere is being extracted to

3067
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:56,399
and is basically uh putting a drain on

3068
02:20:56,399 --> 02:20:59,160
the global economy and if you look at

3069
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:00,600
what happened during the financial

3070
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,220
crisis

3071
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:04,740
each of the financial sector created a

3072
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:07,080
lot of surplus if you will generate a

3073
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:09,780
lot of profits then came the crisis and

3074
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:12,899
it I mean I think in Europe it was the

3075
02:21:12,899 --> 02:21:15,720
figure of 700 billion uh that the

3076
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:17,460
financial sector was kind of bailed out

3077
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:19,859
and it was even more in the U.S

3078
02:21:19,859 --> 02:21:23,939
it's huge figures of saving these kind

3079
02:21:23,939 --> 02:21:26,100
of activities where in general they're

3080
02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:28,380
actually putting a next drain on the

3081
02:21:28,380 --> 02:21:29,880
global economy

3082
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:32,340
so we really have to think about world

3083
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:34,859
cities in a critical way

3084
02:21:34,859 --> 02:21:36,960
what do they contribute or what are the

3085
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:38,340
actors in world cities what do they

3086
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:40,560
contribute and what what kind of things

3087
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,479
effects are or more

3088
02:21:42,479 --> 02:21:45,180
problematic I'm very sorry to take a

3089
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:47,280
little bit more of your time but that

3090
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:49,800
was kind of four ways of being critical

3091
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:53,280
about world and Global cities

3092
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,979
there's no time for Q a now but next

3093
02:21:55,979 --> 02:21:58,560
week we'll continue and maybe we can

3094
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:01,200
start with uh with some questions next

3095
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:03,540
week week if you would have them

3096
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:07,380
and uh we'll talk with the flip side of

3097
02:22:07,380 --> 02:22:08,580
the coin

3098
02:22:08,580 --> 02:22:10,020
about the flip side of the Chrome is

3099
02:22:10,020 --> 02:22:12,180
just polarization so what does it mean

3100
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:14,580
world and Global City formation for

3101
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:16,620
these very places

3102
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:19,040
and these are the two texts that you're

3103
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:23,060
warmly invited to read

3104
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:25,020
thank you

# 3 Polarization in world/global cities

1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:11,439
[Music]

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,639
um

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,319
[Music]

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,820
okay welcome everybody to the third

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,740
session Urban social geography

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,620
this week's topic is polarization growth

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,380
in global cities uh now at just a few

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,660
housekeeping announcements I think in

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,219
the meantime everybody has seen

10
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,500
schedules regarding discussion seminars

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,960
I think there's still some minor issues

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,539
here and there trying to get that sorted

13
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,300
as soon as possible but make sure next

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,520
week there will be a discussion similar

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,039
for each and every one of you so please

16
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,440
attend and if you're there to present

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,899
um stick to the guidelines which just

18
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,640
try to stick in 10 minutes of

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,519
presentation because it will be a tight

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,020
exercise in any case

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,900
try to practice a little bit at home so

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,720
that you stay within those 10 minutes as

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,820
much as possible

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,920
um and then we'll have a nice discussion

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,020
also be advised that we start with

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,840
excursions this Friday and we start in

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,020
Brussels for those uh Urban and urban

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,000
studies who are joining the global City

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,600
Brussels Excursion and as a reminder we

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,520
meet at 10

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,180
at the North Station Brussels North

32
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,799
and we meet at plus Simon Bolivar which

33
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,340
is the main square at the site of the

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,159
World Trade Center looking towards the

35
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,759
canal so Simon Bolivar and you'll see if

36
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,460
you're early either me wearing a very

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,119
special hat uh perhaps and some roses

38
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,340
and then if you're later you'll see a

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,560
whole bunch of people so you can't

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,960
really miss us in any case we'll be down

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,000
the stairs and somewhere on the Square

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,880
there's a few benches there we will

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,720
probably end around five at latest in

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,239
European quarter

45
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,540
uh and yeah uh you can bring lunch uh

46
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,220
but you can also buy lunch somewhere

47
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,220
there will be time over uh at lunch time

48
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,099
to actually uh buy things wherever you

49
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,620
want okay so that's not necessary I have

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,840
no idea what whether it will be this the

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,599
police check the weather forecast and

52
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,420
just accordingly and as I've learned a

53
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,720
pencil works better than a pen it's kind

54
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,120
of weatherproof although I hope it's not

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,980
a tornado that it's going to hit

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,160
Brussels okay

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,860
um right

58
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,739
so last week we've been talking about

59
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,019
you could say uh how to understand the

60
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,660
role of cities in the global economy the

61
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,819
whole discussion about command and

62
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,640
control functions to what extent uh

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,220
Power in This Global Urban system

64
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,459
relates to either headquarters and the

65
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,800
more classic world cities definition or

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,019
rather it refers to you could say this

67
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,720
amalgamation or complex of advanced

68
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,540
producer Services

69
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,739
um who collectively produce control

70
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,120
capabilities over global production

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,220
networks Global Financial markets we

72
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,800
also discussed plenty of uh critiques

73
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,280
different forms of critique on those

74
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,540
paradigms

75
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,239
what we'll try to do today is turn The

76
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
Coin around and

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,860
kind of in the spirit of uh John

78
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,500
Friedman's work back to the 80s if you

79
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,220
will

80
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,799
is also try to reflect on what extent

81
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,420
the insertion in these Global Urban

82
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,780
systems these powerful roles in the

83
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,019
global economy also affects the internal

84
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,299
structure of City so it's kind of this

85
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,819
macro micro link

86
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,459
last week we went from oh my gosh the

87
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,400
economy is globalizing uh what does this

88
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,340
tell us about uh the changing role of

89
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,280
cities in that global economy now having

90
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,920
established that centrality in the

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,019
global economy now we wonder to an

92
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,139
extent there are effects or implications

93
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,238
of that insertion on the social

94
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,360
structure of cities okay so it's kind of

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,520
the the flip side of last week's talk

96
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,919
so just to get started a little bit some

97
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,940
maps

98
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,080
uh was there a question

99
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
yes

100
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,880
I understand yes it was a bit packed so

101
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,979
let's try to have a break somewhere at

102
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,840
the um yeah at six something or five

103
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,440
past six yeah sure no problem

104
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,580
um yeah so Maps uh I I will yes

105
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,940
Apartments

106
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,800
the live stream isn't working

107
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,180
okay

108
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,040
or rather not okay

109
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,199
it is recording

110
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,069
[Music]

111
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,400
yeah

112
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,660
as you can see there's a red button

113
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,419
there and I think

114
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:34,400
the audio is supposed to work

115
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,080
zero viewers okay that gives us a hint

116
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,560
um let's see

117
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,479
the wrong link okay let's see

118
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,600
um

119
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,300
yeah

120
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,280
all right let me just put this online

121
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,240
ah

122
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,040
um

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,379
[Music]

124
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,260
um

125
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,880
[Music]

126
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,080
it looks awfully the same

127
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,220
doesn't it

128
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,490
[Music]

129
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:18,259
thank you

130
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,039
there's already one viewer

131
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,979
so that means it works three yeah I

132
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,460
think we're there

133
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,460
is it okay

134
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,660
yeah

135
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,800
all right then

136
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,520
okay let me just try to start again I

137
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,860
start with some Maps always nice as

138
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,759
Urban geographers here's a maps from

139
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,020
Australia that I will talk a little bit

140
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,180
more about in a second from the

141
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,720
opportunity Atlas in the US basically

142
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,400
shows you

143
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,800
um the median household income of

144
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,319
residents over a certain period so this

145
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,080
is Chicago the darker I mean the the

146
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,900
Bluer the Richer if you will the higher

147
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,380
the income and the more the US is read

148
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,220
it's it's lowering so kind of see is

149
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,340
very much kind of concentrated wealth in

150
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,879
the city center apparently of Chicago

151
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,919
and then you can say the peripheries and

152
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,740
this kind of other Rings uh of Chicago

153
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,319
with lower incomes and then going back

154
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,039
further from the from the center

155
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,958
Richter neighborhoods

156
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,839
um kind of the opposite picture here in

157
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,179
uh Detroit I'll show some examples from

158
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,919
the US because there's this great

159
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,140
material on that

160
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,580
um here we see a very large

161
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,980
concentration of say poverty or low

162
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,640
lower incomes in the city center or if

163
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,399
it's actually the city of Detroit which

164
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,120
interestingly ends at this kind of Road

165
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,560
here which is 80 mile roads which you

166
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,500
may know if you still know who Eminem is

167
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,800
he's been talking about this

168
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,399
um

169
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,380
I think he was born and raised somewhere

170
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,360
over there it acts as a kind of a city

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,940
limit uh you could say the inner city

172
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,700
neighborhood and also uh it's also kind

173
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,380
of a fiscal limit

174
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,980
um

175
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,279
uh at this at this point and we see that

176
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,080
actually it's it's a quite strong social

177
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,300
spatial divide between poorer

178
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,860
neighborhoods in the city center and

179
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,459
then richer suburbs you may know that

180
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,640
Detroit has gone into default a few

181
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,300
years ago so it's kind of uh a weird

182
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,820
situation because it it is a rich

183
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,600
agglomeration if you will but uh the

184
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,640
city itself which kind of ends at the

185
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,399
Eight Mile Road uh is quite poor so

186
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,959
there's a lot of people commuting into

187
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,180
the city that are quite rich but the

188
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,820
fiscal base of the city itself is kind

189
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,060
of it's kind of limited okay so quite a

190
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,600
a large rupture there in space

191
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,240
other examples are

192
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,560
Los Angeles a lot of inner city uh

193
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,000
poverty and very rich uh suburbs if you

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,480
will we all know Beverly Hills uh and

195
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,040
and those kind of

196
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,740
um areas

197
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,920
um this is Miami just another example

198
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,200
where we start contrasts at the

199
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,980
neighborhood level uh between say north

200
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,220
um Miami and South Miami and also quite

201
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,860
a start difference between

202
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,399
um let's say Miami Beach and the kind of

203
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,820
where the tourist areas are

204
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,760
and the continent if you will or what is

205
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,700
kind of interesting in the case of Miami

206
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,980
is that actually uh from a

207
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,140
climatological environmental perspective

208
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,860
it's actually quite safe to live onshore

209
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,019
and these are kind of the poorer

210
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,800
neighborhoods with kind of uh increased

211
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,540
strength of floods and those kind of

212
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,760
things we see some kind of a movement

213
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,180
back onshore also by richer people some

214
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,060
people call this climate related

215
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,620
gentrification we start seeing an

216
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,200
appreciation of real estate values on

217
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,620
Shore so it kind of shows that that

218
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,180
environmental impacts all so

219
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,519
kind of start impacting social spatial

220
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,640
divisions another example

221
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,140
um

222
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,160
of New Orleans as you may know

223
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,579
from more than a decade ago it was hit

224
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:46,380
by a a large hurricane and also had a

225
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,560
very differentiated effect in racialized

226
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,019
and ethnic terms a lot of people were

227
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,959
were hit were left without help a lot of

228
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,640
people residing in these poor

229
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,860
neighborhoods often also had a different

230
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,940
kind of ethnic background

231
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,600
um

232
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,200
so again quite a bit of Divisions there

233
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,660
um San Francisco

234
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,320
um

235
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,100
looks pretty well gentrified uh also

236
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,500
kind of very common sensical I mean you

237
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,720
look at at real estate prices in The

238
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,600
Wider San Francisco Bay area and it's

239
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,019
obviously also related to this kind of

240
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,620
happiness or Global city regeness

241
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,800
regionalism that is that is uh going on

242
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,800
there but just still a few pockets of of

243
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,860
urban property for instance uh Chinatown

244
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,500
there to the north perhaps also the

245
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,300
mission which is a kind of a another

246
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,920
neighborhood yes

247
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,740
always the classification numbers

248
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,180
because it seems to know that the

249
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,040
distribution like that we had income

250
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,800
levels isn't kind of doesn't typically

251
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,980
normalized for the specific uh if you

252
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,660
know anything about that uh no I think

253
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,880
it's uh if you look at the scale it's

254
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,220
the same everywhere right so uh so you

255
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,000
can compare across cities as well and

256
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,040
it's a good point it could mean that we

257
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,620
kind of lose some of the Nuance in

258
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,000
certain places

259
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,180
but what you gain is comparability

260
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,279
across across cities but I can say a bit

261
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,779
more about that in a second

262
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,779
New York uh a city that will be talking

263
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,680
more about uh very kind of Rich Lower

264
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,500
Manhattan if you go to the north I feel

265
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,660
a bit like a weatherman here I'm going

266
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,880
to the north it's uh

267
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,160
it's as we know

268
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,220
um a bit more cloudy no I mean it's a

269
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,579
it's a an area with with lower incomes

270
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,000
uh the Bronx an interesting areas also

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,899
here

272
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,420
um Brooklyn

273
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,980
which we'll be talking about a bit later

274
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,839
uh which kind of follows the income uh

275
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,120
characteristics of of Manhattan there's

276
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,120
kind of still Lower East and we have

277
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,680
like a Little Italy and those kind of

278
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,420
places who are still you could say uh

279
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,860
giving some shelter to people that are

280
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,779
not crazy Rich

281
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,120
um but you could say a lot of

282
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,000
concentrated 12 in the center then or

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,160
what kind of area with with the poorer

284
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,380
population and then you could say uh the

285
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,440
rich kind of suburbs Begin Again

286
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,899
now the point is not necessarily today

287
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,320
to talk about spatial structures uh

288
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,220
you'll talk way more uh about that with

289
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,959
uh with Nick

290
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,660
and she'll discuss segregation patterns

291
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,639
and those kind of things what I want to

292
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,279
focus on is mostly you could say the

293
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,880
reality of it's a division uh income

294
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,120
divisions class divisions in cities so

295
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,699
where do you do these uh examples come

296
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,920
from this is a I think you'll find at

297
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,139
the great website uh it's it's called

298
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,480
the opportunity Atlas

299
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,540
and what I've actually it intends to do

300
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,240
and it also connects to the work uh that

301
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,160
of Nick or that the things that Nick

302
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,220
will talk about it tries to trace you

303
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,079
could say neighborhood effects and the

304
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,880
idea is that the neighborhood that you

305
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,079
raise them

306
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,320
we'll have a substantial role in your

307
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,120
future life chances

308
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,060
and they're they basically uh but you

309
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,639
can read more about about it on this

310
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,459
webpage they basically tracked uh the

311
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,399
evolution of people with a kind of Life

312
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,160
development or careers of people uh

313
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,660
linking it back to their original

314
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,459
neighborhood so to the places they were

315
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,260
born in so they could say okay people

316
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,420
that were born in the Bronx

317
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,699
16 years later

318
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,220
what is the kind of chance they become

319
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,660
incarcerated

320
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,880
what is their income level

321
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,000
etc etc so it's kind of in a way

322
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,279
uh trying to measure some form of

323
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,079
spatial privilege

324
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,440
by having a result or being born in

325
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,600
certain neighborhoods that will have

326
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,480
actually an effect uh which is in some

327
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,360
way you could say reducible to the uh to

328
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,800
the amenities that you have to the

329
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,660
social context that you have but perhaps

330
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,100
there's also even more than that maybe

331
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,139
it's some kind of an isolated spatial

332
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,120
effect beyond that so that's kind of The

333
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Wider context of uh this Atlas And I

334
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,540
think yeah it's I would have hoped that

335
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,820
we had this for Europe it's a great

336
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,160
resource and you can you can browse a

337
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,019
bit do that but what I just want to

338
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,360
focus on today is the fact or use as

339
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,880
exhibits are these

340
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,639
um uh these income maps to illustrate

341
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,920
that

342
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,899
polarization in terms of income is a

343
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,779
day-to-day reality in a lot of U.S

344
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,720
metropolises had we had the data and

345
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,360
Europe we would also find uh quite star

346
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,820
contracts perhaps a little bit less but

347
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,880
still uh it would also be there so what

348
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,519
we can discuss then today I think is to

349
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,220
what extent class divisions

350
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,000
are reproduced in and through space and

351
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,660
actually try to understand why such

352
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,880
divisions occur in cities in the first

353
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,619
place now that's a very big debate

354
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,199
obviously what we'll try to do is try to

355
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,520
link that

356
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,459
to the debate we had last week and try

357
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,919
to link to what extents Global and world

358
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,740
city functions add to

359
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,439
existing polarization because

360
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,679
we cannot reduce it to an effect of

361
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,780
having headquarters or something

362
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,740
but perhaps entering uh the discussion

363
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,380
through globalized urbanization we could

364
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,059
actually start unpacking some of these

365
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,760
things so class divisions are about

366
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,919
the fact that we see social spatial

367
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,200
structures on the basis of social

368
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,880
groupings of

369
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,480
uh income profession occupational

370
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,419
structure and those facts so looking

371
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,660
through income levels and occupation we

372
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,960
find a social especially diverse

373
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
structure

374
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,299
now I use class here in a very let's say

375
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,900
uh analytical naive way because if you

376
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,160
use class

377
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,440
in many cases authors would also refer

378
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,660
to some form of identity formation

379
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,340
linked to that

380
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,280
that's not what I do here

381
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,740
it's more of uh much more mundane

382
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,340
looking at income levels

383
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,960
to look at the changing structure of the

384
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,660
city there's big debates to what extent

385
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,000
there is still such thing as class

386
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,580
identity

387
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,559
has something to do with existence of

388
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,440
subcultures depolitization etc etc

389
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,720
that's not really the point here it

390
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
would be an interesting debate it's more

391
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,340
about can we see objective objectifiable

392
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,340
divisions there in in society based upon

393
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,520
income and occupation okay just to clear

394
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,100
that a little bit

395
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,059
all right

396
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:57,900
um

397
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,120
so polarization

398
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,160
um it has been on the agenda has been

399
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,000
one of the main uh source of impetus or

400
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,799
or starting point for the world and

401
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,020
Global cities debate and again going

402
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,840
back to John Friedman and sort of wolf

403
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,000
in 1982

404
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,940
it's it's what kind of initiated their

405
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,179
interests there so just allow me to

406
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,980
recite with its towers of Steel and

407
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,620
glass with sensible shopping malls The

408
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,980
Citadel is the city's most vulnerable

409
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,260
symbol it's smooth surfaces suggest a

410
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,780
sleek and personality of money power

411
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,299
its interior spaces are ample elegant

412
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,559
and plush

413
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,900
and a properly secluded space is the

414
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,520
transnational Elites have built their

415
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,679
residences and playgrounds

416
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,200
country clubs and Bridal paths and

417
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,840
private beaches the overcrowded ghettos

418
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,179
exist in the far Shadows of the Citadel

419
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,400
where it is further divided into racial

420
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,100
and ethnic enclaves

421
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,500
some areas are Shanty towns none are

422
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,840
well provided with public services

423
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,400
garbages that does not get collected

424
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,559
only the police in the squad cars are

425
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,200
visible in evidence in many places

426
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,660
ghetto residents are allowed outside

427
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,520
their zones only during working hours

428
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,740
their appearance in the Citadel after

429
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,000
dark creates a small panic so it's kind

430
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,940
of a very dystopian image

431
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,120
you could say it's exaggerated it's kind

432
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,260
of

433
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,380
um not exactly empowering it's also very

434
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,660
black white but it's there's something

435
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,000
with this opposition that they that they

436
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,299
try to work with there's some kind of uh

437
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:39,299
growing divide in cities that is going

438
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,419
to become a social problem and that's

439
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,039
also what you also read in the world

440
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,860
city hypothesis of John Friedman

441
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,820
um

442
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,700
it's at some point it will become

443
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,020
everybody's problem and probably

444
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,240
probably also the problem of the elite

445
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,500
now again this kind of description tries

446
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,780
to capture a particular reality last

447
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,940
week I think I mentioned uh Robert De

448
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,760
Niro and Taxi Driver

449
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,900
uh perhaps

450
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,880
um uh John Friedman thought more talking

451
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,720
about contemporary La uh which is kind

452
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,140
of marked by The Citadel form uh to your

453
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,840
left uh if you've ever been to La I mean

454
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,120
a lot of Elites or people that are

455
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,419
walking around here never touch ground

456
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:26,340
they hover around they never go on

457
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,159
ground floor but it's kind of probably

458
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,380
dropped by a taxi in one of the hotels

459
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,900
and then they go at the first floor

460
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,559
level uh or second floor level in the US

461
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,539
from one building to another so it's not

462
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,940
only kind of uh horizontally segregated

463
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,380
there's also some kind of vertical

464
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,480
segregation there so that's kind of this

465
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,720
flow of people is not mixed with

466
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,299
um with bosses by

467
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,539
um then a bit further just kind of two

468
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,880
three four hundred meters is Bull Street

469
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,940
La uh not to be confused with Wall

470
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,340
Street in New York and this is kind of

471
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,020
where a completely different kind of

472
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,820
neighborhoods start so as you remember

473
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,400
this map from La

474
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,520
um in general you could say a very poor

475
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,900
uh in the city uh neighborhood

476
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,960
but kind of imprinted but by a number of

477
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,059
hotels

478
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,900
uh which kind of breathe post-modern uh

479
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,020
feelings and sentiments uh but then very

480
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,820
close to that immediately you're kind of

481
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,600
struck with with rapid kind of decline

482
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,640
um some people would call this a zone of

483
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,320
transition and we'll be talking with

484
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,740
Nick about the burgers uh model of of

485
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,080
cities there's a kind of a place that is

486
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,760
in change it's kind of changing

487
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,400
functions uh it's also a place where a

488
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,240
lot of uh migrants arrive

489
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,159
there's a lot of informal economy etc

490
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,080
etc and there's also kind of an idea

491
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,620
even in contemporary La that these

492
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,080
places The Citadel if you will these

493
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,179
hotels are also places that should not

494
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,980
be frequented by people that have

495
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,260
nothing to do there and just yeah as I

496
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,039
walk by I I think it was at the doorstep

497
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,580
of some of a plaza of Bank of America

498
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,000
something that I that I I took it um

499
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,960
yeah Bank Tower at Fifth Street

500
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,120
and it's kind of regulating social space

501
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,700
there and yeah you can't really read it

502
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,620
now but maybe you should read it at home

503
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,200
there's kind of very ambiguous language

504
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,220
being used so any activities that are uh

505
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,280
how's it phrase again that makes

506
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,059
annoyance or Muses that are

507
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:43,919
already annoying people or could annoy

508
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,559
people are actually not allowed there so

509
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,760
it's a very you could say uh ambiguous

510
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,880
fake description which gives for

511
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,100
instance social security guards the

512
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,559
Liberty to actually yeah remove people

513
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,840
from public space people that are

514
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,720
homeless and there's a there's a huge

515
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,640
homelessness

516
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,740
issue in L.A people are being displaced

517
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,799
even if they put offense in in downtown

518
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:12,480
uh there's a lot of panhandling selling

519
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,340
stuff and those kind of things and that

520
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,100
is kind of policed away so it's not it's

521
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,340
to be removed from from that public

522
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,980
space is because it doesn't fit the kind

523
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,140
of perhaps expectations of people that

524
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,480
that frequent these um

525
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,780
more like Citadel structures okay so we

526
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,059
could say it's still uh it could be an

527
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,919
extreme example but still very much

528
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,880
relevant today 30 or 40 years after uh

529
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,679
John Friedman was I was talking about

530
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,200
and this this is let's say one of the

531
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,299
the leading metropolis and economic

532
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,419
terms uh of the world

533
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,320
um so if it's happening here we could

534
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,299
imagine it's also happening elsewhere

535
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,320
okay

536
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,380
now what I would try to do now is look a

537
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,760
little bit into

538
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,940
exhibits about this archetypical case if

539
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,580
you will New York City

540
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,299
um

541
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,840
to show you a bit more how polarization

542
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,799
patterns have evolved over uh the past

543
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,960
decades

544
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,880
and I mean it's a Greek drama you know

545
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,679
already what is happening and the the

546
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,940
answer is polarization has increased so

547
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,880
income this disparities between

548
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,159
different kind of income groups in

549
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,460
society has increased and why New York

550
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,820
well I mean it's wonderful to say it's

551
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,860
has been one of the of the city's world

552
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,080
cities that have has received a lot of

553
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
attention uh it's still one of the main

554
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,360
uh Financial Centers of the world uh

555
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
it's kind of an extreme case if you will

556
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,059
if you try to research the impact of of

557
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,460
uh these kind of activities on the urban

558
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,799
fabric so

559
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:59,279
um I'm referring here to a very nice uh

560
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,799
study by the fiscal policy Institute

561
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,900
it's a bit dated

562
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,940
um but I still love it

563
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,039
um I'm actually hoping that it will do

564
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,900
the exercise again quite soon the

565
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,900
previous one uh report was just before

566
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,080
the crisis this one is kind of

567
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,299
diagnosing what went on just after the

568
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,580
crisis and I hope they have some kind of

569
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,400
I don't know uh mid-covets kind of

570
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,400
reports sometime soon but I mostly look

571
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,360
in these studies at the evolution of

572
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,340
income distribution and they use all

573
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,580
kind of weird terms such as desiles

574
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,260
quintiles quartiles which refers to the

575
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,020
place of an income group in the entire

576
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,500
population so a quintile is actually a

577
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,320
fifth of the entire distribution so top

578
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,100
quintile would be the top uh 20 of

579
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,860
earners and their average income the

580
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,200
bottom quintile would be

581
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,380
um the average of of the lowest 20 of

582
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,679
incomes right so these are relative

583
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,779
terms that show the position

584
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,880
with a certain income

585
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,740
what you would they position you would

586
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,779
take in this distribution okay and it's

587
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:16,380
usually focusing on income uh which is

588
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,500
income out of Labor

589
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,279
um in one way or another okay so this is

590
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,659
just one

591
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,100
um comparison and what they also do is

592
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,460
and they try to compare New York City

593
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,679
quite often uh sometimes they don't have

594
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,380
data on on New York City itself and then

595
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,080
they use New York state but try to be as

596
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,419
specific as possible

597
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,340
um and then they also try to compare to

598
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,779
the United States that's a question

599
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,200
yeah

600
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,419
uh I think I mean large really

601
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,520
polarization but the point is indeed and

602
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,840
that's kind of something that we get to

603
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,860
later

604
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,919
is that uh the question is if you

605
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,500
obviously more most easily start looking

606
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,159
at income because this kind of data are

607
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,779
easiest to find the next question is

608
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,400
what's the underlying occupational

609
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,340
structure so what produces that reality

610
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,260
uh and that's something that will pick

611
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,240
up uh on later and it's obviously

612
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,240
connected uh quite often kind of if you

613
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,340
think about the shift towards high-end

614
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,200
service jobs

615
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,860
would generate higher incomes

616
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,880
um

617
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,220
but the connection is not always there

618
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,320
is always highly contextual the same

619
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,760
kind of

620
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,600
um

621
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,059
occupations in different contexts may

622
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,480
give a very different income level and

623
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,559
that can be for a lot of reasons

624
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,580
so yeah but here we're talking about

625
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,980
income polarization uh to be sure

626
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,260
because it's it's it's the most obvious

627
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,760
Here and Now

628
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,940
so yeah as I said they try to compare

629
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,039
um city of New York but sometimes they

630
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,080
use New York State Etc so what you see

631
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,679
is here the median family income so this

632
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:17,760
kind of

633
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,980
people that are just in the middle of

634
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,020
this distribution this has been

635
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,260
declining over the past I think

636
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,100
um

637
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,799
uh 10 I mean in this case it's kind of

638
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,440
three to four years uh after uh the

639
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,480
creative session right so you see that

640
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,320
2008 2009 2010 2011.

641
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,500
um you find a steep Decline and it's

642
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,200
actually more more pronounced in uh the

643
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,419
city of New York so the city of New York

644
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:48,179
on average the median income was already

645
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,279
much lower than compared to New York

646
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,960
state which is kind of more refers to

647
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,360
the broader agglomeration mostly but

648
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,700
then also the rest of the state and it

649
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,580
was also significantly lower at the

650
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,860
United States so in general there's a

651
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,640
decline in median income uh in the city

652
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,140
of New York

653
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,539
at the same time what we see at the

654
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,360
other kind of sides of the picture is

655
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,200
the share of uh income total income

656
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,260
going to the top one percent and here is

657
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,360
again a comparison between

658
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,159
us and uh red then the state of New York

659
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,100
in green and then New York City kind of

660
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,700
smallest scale in uh blue which is on

661
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,500
top line so it's kind of interesting to

662
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,279
see and this data goes back to the 1980s

663
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,799
um they all share very similar patterns

664
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,200
here at the beginning the share of

665
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,940
income going to the top one percent

666
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,039
that's just reminds yourself one percent

667
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,380
of the entire distribution the top one

668
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,440
percent against the 99 remember

669
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,179
um was about 12 to 30 in the 1980s this

670
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,600
has exploded right so it has grown uh

671
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,760
across all scales

672
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,059
to something modest off you could say uh

673
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:13,020
22 in the US so one percent owns 22 of

674
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,340
all income just reflect on that

675
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,740
um and then in New York we see that

676
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,940
almost 45 most almost half of all income

677
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,399
is owned by the top one percent okay so

678
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,940
we all know Jeff Bezos and others uh but

679
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,159
this is kind of way more systematic yes

680
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,380
yeah

681
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,440
but the previous one yeah that's true I

682
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,899
mean this is just a figure

683
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:55,620
and it's one of these progress of liquid

684
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,159
possessions

685
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,539
yeah that's true that's right I mean

686
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,640
this is kind of you could say

687
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,760
uh the median income has decreased

688
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,360
everywhere uh it does seem to you do

689
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,000
seem to find here I would say that it it

690
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,179
decreases more in New York City compared

691
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,360
to others uh it's it's less you would

692
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,039
have to look at percentages there for

693
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,320
New York state or us but I think it's

694
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,460
it's kind of um going from 59 to 54.

695
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,620
yeah that's a very significant decline

696
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,200
but it's not one-on-one uh comparable no

697
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,320
you're right so this goes back way more

698
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,700
in time

699
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,799
um but the main point being here is that

700
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,260
a very small percentage is actually

701
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,220
running away with a lot of the income

702
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,919
and again indeed you see that here's

703
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,840
connection to what you were asking there

704
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,020
was a decline in general also for these

705
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,620
top one percent uh uh with the global

706
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,200
financial crisis but you also see that

707
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,720
it's kind of very quick rebound of these

708
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,600
highest incomes right so they they kind

709
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,820
of take a hit and that has something to

710
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,460
do probably with their fact that they're

711
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,760
exposed to so much parts of the economy

712
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,799
but then they rebounds uh quite soon

713
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,179
okay uh another kind of graph uh here

714
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,940
comparing New York state to the US so

715
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,519
unfortunately not at the at the city

716
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,000
level but yeah you get an idea here it's

717
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,919
comparing the top five percent in terms

718
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,460
of income and total income with

719
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,059
um

720
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,159
which you could say the bottom green

721
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,360
time so the the 20 uh lowest incomes and

722
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,880
then the middle group right so from 40

723
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,419
to 60 in the distribution so what you

724
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,039
find is that

725
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:47,820
um

726
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,039
over the years

727
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,220
um and this is comparing the late 70s so

728
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,980
you could say the mid 2000s so I mean

729
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,039
it's a dated analysis but that's uh the

730
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,720
furthest that they that they could go in

731
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,120
this analysis in uh the 1970s the ratio

732
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,239
between the top five percent and the

733
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,560
lowest incomes was 7.4 so people in the

734
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,800
top five earned 7.4 times more than

735
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,659
people with the lowest incomes in the

736
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,760
lowest quintile

737
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,239
um by the mid-2000s it had become 17.3

738
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,899
times right so take the income of the

739
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,918
lowest

740
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,179
um uh income households times 17.3 right

741
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,940
so tremendous tremendously growing

742
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,560
difference and it's also when you

743
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,480
compare it to the right growing much

744
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,500
faster uh than what you see in U.S in

745
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,639
general

746
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,280
and it still also pertains to the

747
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,719
relation between the top five percent

748
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,719
and but you could say the middle income

749
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,659
group or the middle class even there is

750
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,760
kind of these disparities have doubled

751
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,760
and they have have increased more uh

752
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,380
when you compare it to the US so it went

753
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:07,080
from 2.9 to 5.3 compared to uh 4.7

754
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,700
um when compared to yes okay so

755
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,500
massively increasing that difference so

756
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,780
it means that there's a growing

757
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,820
concentration of income and a very small

758
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,320
group

759
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,560
another exhibit showing this is uh

760
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,960
comparing the growth in income between

761
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,820
different groups so the bottom quintile

762
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,180
again lowest incomes actually lost a

763
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,880
share in total income

764
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,160
um when you compare the late 90s to the

765
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,020
mid-2000s

766
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,500
there was some growth for middle-income

767
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,960
groups and it was a very large group

768
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,400
that growth 18 to 19 in the income of

769
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,040
the life is good okay so the trends are

770
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,400
kind of clear it was a slow hiccup uh

771
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,800
with the global financial crisis but as

772
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,140
a kind of a secular Trend where a very

773
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,780
small percentage of the population yet

774
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,020
one percent or five percent is gaining

775
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,560
more and more uh share in the total uh

776
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,700
distribution I think

777
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,640
one way of of looking at that is why

778
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,440
that could be and we'll talk about

779
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,720
General patterns also more towards the

780
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,920
end of uh of today's uh session

781
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,619
is looking at what happens

782
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,800
um in evolutions of productivity so with

783
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,020
kind of with one hour of work what kind

784
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,200
of value do you produce how much cookies

785
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,400
do you cut or how much cards do you make

786
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,839
or how much

787
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,460
um you could say transactions Financial

788
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,200
transactions can you uh can you conclude

789
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,940
um versus the income from those

790
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,740
activities so what you see is that from

791
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,180
2001 until uh 2011 here there's actually

792
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,619
a 14 increase in productivity so for the

793
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,520
same hour of work you produce 14 more

794
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,500
wealth if you will

795
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,619
but when you look at the income levels

796
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,980
um from labor annual average real wage

797
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,320
so these are the the salaries that

798
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,579
people get

799
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,700
it has increased a little bit but it has

800
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,440
by no means kept base wet the Rises and

801
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,359
productivity left okay so it's kind of

802
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,859
it's running away

803
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,740
so there's an increase of about what is

804
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,220
it here two three four percent

805
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,460
um as we go across those uh 10 years

806
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,980
okay so that means that something else

807
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,320
is probably happening with the Weld and

808
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,240
value that's being created

809
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,680
and we talked a little bit about

810
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,099
financialization last week it means that

811
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,619
it's if it's not going to labor it's

812
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,599
probably going to the factor of capital

813
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,800
which means shareholders or uh you could

814
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,740
say well remunerated employees such as

815
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,640
CEOs managers who actually take uh a

816
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,619
growing piece off the cake

817
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,940
yeah this is New York

818
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,660
um

819
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,200
we'll get to more global patterns more

820
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,480
towards the end as a kind of an Outlook

821
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,700
exercise

822
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,960
but it's a trend that is that is

823
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,320
occurring across uh across countries

824
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,240
right and there's you probably know the

825
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,700
work of Thomas picketing it may have

826
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,240
rung a bell already uh he and his group

827
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,480
of we could say economic historians

828
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,960
have looked at systematically at income

829
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,520
data and income distribution data uh and

830
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,619
a more long-term perspective and they

831
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,540
yeah they can't compare all countries

832
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,460
because their data sources are limited

833
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,040
but they compare a number of key

834
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,720
European countries uh us UK Australia

835
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,920
etc etc so yeah these are unfortunately

836
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,640
um

837
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,520
patterns we see everywhere but in some

838
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,079
contexts they're more extreme than

839
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,680
elsewhere and US UK and we'll get to

840
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,859
that at some point are the most extreme

841
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,260
cases here

842
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,780
so yeah run away

843
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,599
um productivity but not necessarily more

844
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,460
remuneration

845
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,400
on the other side is and this is I think

846
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,700
a very telling graph is

847
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,640
to what extent uh can you make a living

848
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,599
a decent living if you work full time

849
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,520
on the minimum wage

850
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,980
right this was the analysis and I go

851
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,760
back again to the 1980s is it right

852
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,540
um

853
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,240
yeah or even earlier and you see that

854
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,300
during a substantial period of time if

855
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,460
you worked at the minimum wage

856
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,440
you were well above the poverty line

857
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,579
right so you had like 120 percent uh so

858
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,460
you could live if you will decently and

859
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,680
you wouldn't live in poverty

860
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,079
and this has completely melted away so

861
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,380
uh became uh very bad in the kind of

862
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,260
1990s but even well into today you see

863
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,079
that even if you work uh full time at

864
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,960
this wage you still fall below uh the

865
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,579
poverty line okay so it's kind of

866
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,820
something institutionally is wrong there

867
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,560
and the fiscal policy Institute has been

868
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,020
one of the main I would say Advocates

869
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,599
also for an increase in minimum wages

870
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,820
uh and yeah and a lot of metropolitan

871
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,119
areas also for instance in in London

872
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,640
there's also kind of uh demand for

873
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,119
London living wage uh which sometimes

874
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,420
should be higher uh than in the rest of

875
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,680
the country because the standard of

876
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,500
living it's just more expensive in these

877
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,140
large metropolitan areas okay so a very

878
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,780
dire picture a lot of people at the very

879
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,480
bottom are not only you could you could

880
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,940
say losing out in terms of income levels

881
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,640
it's also still it's not sufficient to

882
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,460
actually make a living uh when you're at

883
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,820
that site of the income distribution

884
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,040
so just to give you a bit of a picture

885
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,619
from this arguably extreme case of the

886
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,260
the sincerity of the situation

887
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,720
uh and yeah you can find this report

888
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,380
online pulling apart uh New York

889
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,420
um and I would recommend that you have a

890
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,579
look at that but I think the conclusion

891
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:36,060
is that we see uh in growing income

892
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,339
polarization in the state of New York

893
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:40,619
more narrowly in New York City

894
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,800
and it's becoming more dramatic than the

895
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,720
US average

896
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,960
okay over to you for another one to two

897
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,540
minutes group thing and I would like to

898
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,119
ask you why it is according to you that

899
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,280
specifically world and Global cities are

900
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,800
becoming so polarized okay and then

901
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,300
we'll take the question straight after

902
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,070
that go ahead

903
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:16,920
[Music]

904
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,820
thank you

905
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,970
again

906
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,820
[Music]

907
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,300
today

908
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,859
okay

909
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:01,099
thank you

910
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,780
I miss you too

911
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,339
[Music]

912
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:51,439
[Music]

913
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:59,599
thank you

914
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,300
okay let's hear it this is what you came

915
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,440
up with

916
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,800
you

917
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,460
[Music]

918
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,540
what did you come up with

919
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,420
yeah

920
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,260
a little areas

921
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,819
so let's speak for four people

922
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,980
so there's a comment about the cost of

923
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,720
living

924
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,760
okay but it's more you could say more a

925
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,220
symptom if you will I mean it's kind of

926
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,000
the price of real estate housing

927
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,640
um daily consumption etc etc

928
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,220
you could say it affects everybody

929
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,740
to a similar degree unless we

930
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,060
acknowledge that there's even more

931
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,040
differences I mean that's that the cost

932
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,079
of living for the rich would be also

933
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:51,780
very high but maybe they can afford it

934
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,060
it's not really an explanation of why we

935
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,720
see polarization I think yep I think a

936
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,520
lot of governments buy into the tripod

937
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,800
and so we see large companies which

938
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,260
already have a lot of capital getting

939
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,240
more subsidies from the government

940
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,859
getting

941
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:11,700
um

942
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,920
place in say special economic zones

943
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,700
where electricity land live around a lot

944
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,520
of things are subsidized uh

945
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,220
they're they're drinking well providing

946
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,180
um

947
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,060
employment however that said employment

948
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,000
the salary is not distributed so you

949
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,260
have the larger companies getting larger

950
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,839
what do you mean with trickle-down

951
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,800
Logics yes so I mean the the rhetoric of

952
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,740
that is of course that if you have a

953
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,440
large company

954
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,060
it provides employment and the ideal

955
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,400
scenario is to be more people with more

956
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,460
money except what often happens is that

957
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,160
the top one percent offset company will

958
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,460
probably get larger income and the

959
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,060
income distribution is quite skewed

960
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,040
so yeah this this important critique I

961
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,720
think that's also what for instance

962
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,180
Doreen Massey was talking about I mean

963
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,000
and throughout her career fighting this

964
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,980
kind of trickle-down Economics principle

965
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,540
and she talks about

966
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,420
because of global cityization

967
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,060
which is actually producing inequalities

968
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,700
which are not it's not just let's wait

969
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,280
for a bit more Global City formation and

970
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,079
it will be eased away

971
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,660
what he actually says no uh this

972
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,060
polarization is an outcome of global

973
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,119
City formation uh it's because you have

974
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,980
certain activities that we will have

975
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,180
this is not something it's something

976
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,940
permanent and not something that will go

977
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,980
away a bit more trickle-down economics

978
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,800
so because economics something with

979
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,780
the fact that you create multipliers

980
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,240
that money circulates to the territory

981
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,540
we can create jobs will then fuel growth

982
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,640
etc etc but little is said about the

983
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,220
income levels of these people uh what

984
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,079
kind of jobs are created what kind of

985
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,480
working circumstance Etc right

986
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,859
okay other ideas

987
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,300
um

988
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,079
capitalism just how do I make the most

989
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:33,000
money as fast as possible and the more

990
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,319
you try to do that and practically

991
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,599
intuition as possible the more exciting

992
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,359
social problems but you know it just it

993
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,420
like self-destructure the same sounds

994
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,980
so there's deliberate corporate

995
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,460
strategies but perhaps they can also be

996
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,859
more viable and some live touch

997
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:51,800
regulations compared to other places

998
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,339
yeah yeah

999
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,680
the

1000
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,780
formulations

1001
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,220
so yeah that's true there's a lot of

1002
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,220
local policy that works towards creating

1003
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,380
some kind of a business climate

1004
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,780
of national policies that are

1005
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,900
restructuring the detection of Labor etc

1006
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,339
etc yeah

1007
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:42,060
I mean I also think that the cities are

1008
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,160
trying to struggle to attract global

1009
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,800
companies and that at the end global

1010
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,020
companies They Don't Really enrich City

1011
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,880
budgets with the taxes because they

1012
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,240
either evade it either the city trying

1013
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,460
to once again attract those local

1014
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,099
companies trying to subsidize them in

1015
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,400
terms of substitute but then

1016
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,680
like taxes is something to support the

1017
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,079
lower weight of the more like insecure

1018
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:09,720
parts of the population and then like

1019
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,480
they uh like a low-income workers they

1020
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,040
don't get the support of the city

1021
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:17,940
okay let's

1022
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,800
there was a lot of answers from there so

1023
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,359
spatial redistribution yeah

1024
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,839
Taxation and also creating social

1025
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:34,079
policies so this is something in one of

1026
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,839
the tasks he just mentions it's very

1027
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:39,020
briefly about the uh develop

1028
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,160
developmental State something like this

1029
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,859
like this uh this process has changed in

1030
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,560
things that have a more active role and

1031
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,640
I think it's going to be something that

1032
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,400
also shapes this polarization absolutely

1033
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,599
yeah foreign

1034
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,839
but you know there's a maybe a

1035
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,300
concentration of people who derived a

1036
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,680
larger portion of their income from

1037
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,079
financialization

1038
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,079
foreign

1039
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,180
because I mean we also have to

1040
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,280
distinguish between uh say processes

1041
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,020
that work across the entire territory

1042
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,020
they say okay what holds for countries

1043
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,060
and what is so specific about some

1044
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,619
places that they seem to be more

1045
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,540
polarized than the rest of the country

1046
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,619
okay yeah

1047
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:01,819
minimum

1048
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,200
thank you

1049
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:12,119
easily removed

1050
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,760
[Music]

1051
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,300
awesome yeah uh at the end at the back

1052
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,280
sorry sorry

1053
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,119
um

1054
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,940
yeah I was thinking about following the

1055
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,000
responsibility for social reproduction

1056
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,160
has been privatized and put on to the

1057
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,440
individuals so especially in places like

1058
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,359
the US where there's continual crises

1059
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,339
it's extremely hard for the working

1060
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,619
classes

1061
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:39,380
of course with responsibilities

1062
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,839
and then also like a privatization of

1063
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:45,420
of column is going to do

1064
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,339
and different quality

1065
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:49,079
can you say a bit more about social

1066
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,300
reproduction because it's a very

1067
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,400
analytical term or kind of almost

1068
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,440
theoretical term what do you mean with

1069
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,880
that

1070
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,400
um just like things like

1071
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,099
um everything from Healthcare to taking

1072
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,660
care of children

1073
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,680
um yeah you know feeding your family

1074
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,119
having them enough money for utilities

1075
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,859
and things like that

1076
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,140
right so and when it comes to the system

1077
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,780
the worker itself needs to be produced

1078
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,480
in a social way uh it's not a good time

1079
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,119
making the worker I mean physically but

1080
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,720
also educating the worker feeding uh I

1081
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,700
mean kind of educating and socializing

1082
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,740
them into a particular uh working

1083
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,960
culture yeah

1084
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,960
um

1085
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:48,440
I guess ideas Rich the richest

1086
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,660
before I feel like places where that is

1087
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,819
more accepted like in the UK there's

1088
00:52:53,819 --> 00:52:56,700
like hot dogs like reality TV for

1089
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,020
example like

1090
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,599
um big brother like benefit the street

1091
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:03,300
it like kind of created the idea that

1092
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,220
the poor are just like messy people who

1093
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,880
kind of think about their property

1094
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,680
oh yeah

1095
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,319
I I would agree but I think then the

1096
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:14,700
question is to what extent would it play

1097
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,420
out more in an urban context than say in

1098
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,180
I don't know rural Britain maybe because

1099
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,180
it's poverty is is less present there

1100
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,520
although I would like to see a map of

1101
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,819
that but yeah I think the power of new

1102
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:32,040
liberal ideas is clearly going to but

1103
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,660
okay one final idea

1104
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,139
[Music]

1105
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,400
um

1106
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,760
so it has something to do with them

1107
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,220
perhaps with um existing solidarity

1108
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,160
networks it would extends there's still

1109
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,040
solidarity between people uh and what

1110
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,720
extent the urban environment still

1111
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,520
supports that

1112
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,400
you've covered quite a bit of ground I I

1113
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,859
don't have it in my slides all of that

1114
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:31,079
but I think it shows what you can do

1115
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,359
collectively in trying to um try to pick

1116
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,520
up this puzzle so so thank you for that

1117
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,160
what I just want to do is is take you to

1118
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,260
a number of slides because I think try

1119
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,240
to gather a number of elements and then

1120
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,540
work towards this polarization thesis

1121
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,839
however fullable it is uh we'll try to

1122
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:51,059
try to get there and then we'll take a

1123
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:52,920
short break

1124
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,079
so yeah uh conceptualization

1125
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,960
uh have been written about this uh I

1126
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,700
I've been mostly referring to the global

1127
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,160
City but there's plenty of other kind of

1128
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,980
scholarship on that uh as you can see in

1129
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,140
this picture it has been one of the main

1130
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,280
kind of

1131
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,180
um

1132
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,960
um you could say theorized conceptualize

1133
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,300
uh problems of contemporary cities and

1134
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,640
something with yeah what you do with

1135
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,520
this uh with these dualities

1136
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,339
um John monkov and Manuel constells

1137
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:28,680
talked about dual City Susan Feinstein

1138
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,680
wrote by divided cities Peter Marcus

1139
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,960
another great scholar talk about quarter

1140
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,800
cities

1141
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,200
uh Buddhists talked about fragmented

1142
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,319
cities Etc so it's kind of has been one

1143
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,300
of the main debates in urban social

1144
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,079
geography but it seems that uh all these

1145
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,079
kind of uh things necessarily or or most

1146
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,660
emblematically start to connect

1147
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,900
um to cities rather than wider uh wider

1148
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,119
territories and

1149
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,400
um and and a lot of people start to look

1150
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,480
for

1151
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,339
um particular answers as I said last

1152
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:04,140
week I tend to go back to the 80s

1153
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,020
because it's kind of my my natural

1154
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,760
cohort

1155
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,760
um but quite often people go back to the

1156
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,339
60s the 70s and this kind of wider

1157
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:17,880
restructuration of of cities and wider

1158
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,599
economies and we could say uh the North

1159
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,460
Atlantic sphere so it's

1160
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,440
I mean there's a lot of things have been

1161
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,420
written there's a rich scholarship but

1162
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,660
arguments it's kind of biased if you

1163
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,020
will to say the crisis of cities or the

1164
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,660
the crisis cities have underwent

1165
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,059
in Western Europe Northern America okay

1166
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:41,099
so there's plenty of stuff that needs to

1167
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:44,339
be written uh on on the histories and

1168
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:47,339
these historical trajectories uh of say

1169
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:51,780
Chinese cities uh African cities etc etc

1170
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,800
um

1171
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,559
but it's not something that uh that I

1172
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:59,220
can now cover uh today okay but

1173
00:56:59,220 --> 00:56:59,960
um

1174
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,180
it's yeah kind of the general narrative

1175
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,400
that you find in these different uh kind

1176
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,740
of analysis is that the economic

1177
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,020
restructuring kind of started uh in the

1178
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,119
1960s 70s when

1179
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,579
there's a culmination of the crisis of

1180
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:16,619
what they call North Atlantic fortism

1181
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:19,619
and as I I think explained last week or

1182
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:21,599
two weeks ago

1183
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,420
um there was this system of regulating

1184
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,940
capitalism where there was a deal say

1185
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,000
between the workers and capital that

1186
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,140
increased productivity would uh

1187
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,700
um that the fruits of that and the

1188
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,319
surface of that would be shared with

1189
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:40,440
workers okay this is kind of Ford going

1190
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,980
back to to Henry Ford uh he he paid his

1191
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,440
workers a little bit more

1192
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,119
um so they would be more productive but

1193
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:50,520
they could actually in fact also buy the

1194
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,160
cars that they were producing uh at the

1195
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,140
at the hellish speed okay so that was

1196
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,839
kind of the Wilder model uh we saw the

1197
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,579
emergence of the middle classes in the

1198
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:02,640
immediate post-war era everybody could

1199
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,000
could buy uh consumer goods because of

1200
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
rising productivity levels uh it was the

1201
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,280
invention of free time to actually spend

1202
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,680
your money and consume it and so I can

1203
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,500
actually go to shop Shops and and buy

1204
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,099
stuff at some point this model kind of

1205
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:22,619
started to crumble there were problems

1206
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:24,059
with

1207
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:26,579
um with productivity it couldn't keep up

1208
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:29,940
with Rising uh wages

1209
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,460
and kind of them at the macro level the

1210
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,960
solution was

1211
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,319
a relocation of production uh and you

1212
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:38,819
could say the start point of

1213
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:41,280
globalization the new international

1214
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,880
division of labor the effect was that

1215
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,980
there was de-industrialization and you

1216
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,079
could say the core of the world economy

1217
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:53,099
is high income industrialized places so

1218
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:54,960
again we're talking about Northern

1219
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,540
America Western Europe mostly

1220
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,660
and it's set in motion the process of uh

1221
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,819
structural and employment

1222
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:04,380
which was

1223
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,720
felt throughout countries and

1224
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,020
territories but was very very Urban uh

1225
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,880
in many contexts there was a lot of

1226
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,220
productive activities within cities

1227
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,680
um and as these active moved away became

1228
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,940
obsolete what happened is that you could

1229
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,619
say Urban poverty and unemployment

1230
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:28,559
became very much Urban phenomena so

1231
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,720
cities lost their functions productive

1232
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,859
functions

1233
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,420
but they had to deal with a lot of

1234
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:36,540
things say the costs of unemployment etc

1235
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,079
etc so we have a decline in tax base and

1236
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,500
in many contexts what you see is a shift

1237
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,700
towards

1238
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,640
austerity so there's less income

1239
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,119
so this budget cuts etc etc so the whole

1240
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,480
idea and the immediate post-war era was

1241
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,660
a strong Indian state so you had mass

1242
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,880
production Mass consumption but also

1243
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,680
with states that was inspired by John

1244
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,079
men and he said okay if there's an issue

1245
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,559
with uh with consumption

1246
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:10,680
well the the government itself will be

1247
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,099
the first investor will make sure that

1248
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:16,980
um that the economy keeps on going that

1249
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,660
kind of changed in the spirit as well

1250
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,640
the state was seen as something that had

1251
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,059
to roll back its activities stop

1252
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:27,240
interfering uh with all kinds of uh

1253
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,299
market-based processes and so this kind

1254
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:32,940
of the starting point of uh the

1255
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,760
neoliberal ideology

1256
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,680
uh whereas the state was still kind of

1257
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,040
setting the rules of Market uh Market

1258
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,480
systems

1259
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,540
it stopped indeed providing for instance

1260
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,880
a whole range of public goods that that

1261
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,280
were mentioned in many countries okay so

1262
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,040
most of I mean accentuated this took

1263
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,440
place in the US and the UK you could say

1264
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,480
the new liberal heartlands or the

1265
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,000
leading examples of that with uh that

1266
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,700
Margaret Thatcher Ronald Reagan

1267
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,400
but it started to creep in an effect it

1268
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,099
became some kind of a mobile policy that

1269
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:10,319
was also in practice being implemented

1270
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,420
in other contexts

1271
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,180
sometimes to a lesser extent in a more

1272
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,579
variegated way etc etc and the whole

1273
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:21,059
research agenda by Francis Jamie pack a

1274
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:23,640
very nice uh and one of the leading

1275
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,400
scorers in in urban geography

1276
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,339
is about that so what is neoliberalism

1277
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:32,520
what is neoliberalization is it the same

1278
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,160
everywhere how variegated is it how does

1279
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,720
it connect itself to different kind of

1280
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,700
contexts that's that's the whole thing

1281
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,700
so we see those ideas spreading a lot

1282
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,859
across a lot of these say Western

1283
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:46,799
European North American states

1284
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,559
um and in in one way or another it leads

1285
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:52,260
to some kind of to a self-fulfilling

1286
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:55,200
prophecy because as the state Retreats

1287
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,140
from certain areas

1288
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,200
it deregulates very often

1289
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,140
um a lot of these uh these markets which

1290
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,260
hands more power to large corporations

1291
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,720
and we already talked about uh

1292
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,079
multinational corporations uh last week

1293
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:16,020
and we see a rising concentration of

1294
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,599
power of industrial and financial

1295
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:22,380
conglomerations etc etc and indeed in

1296
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,720
the process where also the state is kind

1297
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,160
of rescaled where a lot of

1298
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,680
responsibilities are kind of pushed to

1299
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,440
the local level you get some kind of a

1300
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,900
self-fulfilling Mantra of competing

1301
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,799
cities to attract Global capital okay so

1302
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,819
that's kind of the situation where a lot

1303
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:44,220
of policy makers you could say in the

1304
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,980
80s end of the

1305
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,059
1980s were kind of facing uh a kind of

1306
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:53,880
zero-sum game where there's only so much

1307
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,700
production for instance to take place so

1308
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,460
Amazon will uh will have its Center

1309
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,920
either here or it will go across the

1310
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,180
border and what can we do about that

1311
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,619
well

1312
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:10,559
David Harvey is one of the the the main

1313
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,619
uh scholars in this area he says well

1314
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:16,079
what we see that a lot of our policy

1315
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,599
makers are trying to do is they try to

1316
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:22,559
become entrepreneurial right so whereas

1317
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,180
they were managing

1318
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,760
the territories and trying to think

1319
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,319
about

1320
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,740
um the spatial structures of welfare uh

1321
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,780
amenities and to distribute growth

1322
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,880
across the territory you kind of get the

1323
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,059
flip side a much more competitive idea

1324
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:41,880
about growth and a new kind of role for

1325
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,220
people that were previously managing

1326
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,079
territories to become some kind of

1327
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,240
entrepreneurs right

1328
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,000
and David Harvey talks about this in his

1329
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,579
famous piece and I think uh people and

1330
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,500
miss and four cities also discussed this

1331
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:00,660
with um with Matthew uh from uh he

1332
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,160
describes the shift from Urban

1333
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,839
managerialism to Urban

1334
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,640
entrepreneurialism where you get a

1335
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,680
different kind of mindset with policy

1336
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,880
now

1337
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,640
okay so this is kind of the Mantra is a

1338
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,200
bit structuralist but it's kind of the

1339
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,960
reasoning of how you could say macro

1340
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,900
phenomena at some point lead to a very

1341
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,599
particular Urban reality

1342
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:26,760
um and what David Harvey then does and

1343
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,280
this is a kind of a short excurse that I

1344
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,619
want to take you through what it does it

1345
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:33,180
says okay in this competitive

1346
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,280
circumstances

1347
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,780
we see that policy makers start to adopt

1348
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,599
a number of strategies and a number of

1349
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:44,339
entrepreneurial strategies and I'll take

1350
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:45,960
you through them

1351
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,900
be advised and sometimes it kind of

1352
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,400
interesting to see that people think

1353
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,280
there's kind of some kind of a recipe by

1354
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,319
David Harvey say if your cities in

1355
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:58,740
trouble please consider applying this

1356
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,020
strategy this is not what David Harvey

1357
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,540
does he kind of observes and analyzes

1358
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,900
this phenomena he's not prescribing some

1359
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,760
kind of entrepreneurial strategies that

1360
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,680
then should be implemented by policy

1361
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,160
makers just to be clear which reminds me

1362
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,859
of an anecdote David Harvey I think once

1363
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:20,280
gave a lecture in New York and he I

1364
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,819
think he's famous for his analysis or

1365
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,240
reading of of thus Capital

1366
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,540
by Michael Marx volume one has very nice

1367
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,819
videos on that he has a companion to

1368
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:33,619
Capital

1369
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:35,880
uh and also gave a lecture about that

1370
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,040
somewhere in New York and apparently

1371
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,260
there were also some investment bankers

1372
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,859
in the room and after the lecture his

1373
01:05:43,859 --> 01:05:45,599
investment bank has walked up to him and

1374
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,940
said well Mr Harvey I think you have a

1375
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,619
very good understanding of how Finance

1376
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:51,720
Capital Works would it be possible

1377
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,850
possible to hire you as a consultant

1378
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,559
[Music]

1379
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:58,920
um I think he declined but yeah just to

1380
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,200
be very clear I mean it's

1381
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,119
um it's an analysis that he provides

1382
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,819
it's not a recipe that it thinks that

1383
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:08,579
should be installed okay all right

1384
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:09,299
um

1385
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,980
so yeah I mean the first kind of thing

1386
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,660
that is under pressure if you will is

1387
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,940
these productive activities or what it

1388
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,559
sees is that

1389
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,079
um some policy makers still manage to

1390
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:21,839
kind of keep productive activities in

1391
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,480
their territories and I mean that still

1392
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,220
there will be some public and private

1393
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,380
Investments and you could say the

1394
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,660
physical and social base

1395
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,000
um uh of course physical and social

1396
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,039
infrastructure so think about knowledge

1397
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,700
networks educational facilities uh try

1398
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,520
to build Venture Capital sometimes the

1399
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,020
state becomes some kind of venture

1400
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,200
capitalist itself uh but indeed as has

1401
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,720
been described also try to work on all

1402
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,780
the things that are too costly uh

1403
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,780
um reduce excessive labor costs for

1404
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,520
instance

1405
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,480
um tax breaks etc etc and that quite

1406
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,819
often kind of leading the idea is that

1407
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:04,740
the city regions should become yeah

1408
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:07,500
silicon valleys uh that that should be

1409
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,780
the ambition that they should seek to

1410
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:12,000
attract Capital people

1411
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,280
um sometimes this kind of set to attract

1412
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,920
the creative class to refer to Richard

1413
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,579
Florida but it's kind of this idea that

1414
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:23,819
yes a high-tech productive city is still

1415
01:07:23,819 --> 01:07:27,599
mad imaginable and we have to create the

1416
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,579
right business environment to get there

1417
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:33,180
okay so images of clusters and there's a

1418
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,940
lot of cluster policy but it used to be

1419
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,980
I think in a lot of cities

1420
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,359
it's also the reason why you had

1421
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,780
dedicated districts Edge cities uh

1422
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,839
linked to healthcare or biotech

1423
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:49,319
etc etc so that's kind of one strategy

1424
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:52,140
that is still imaginable for cities

1425
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,660
the second element entrepreneurial

1426
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,000
strategy is to compete for consumption

1427
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,599
yeah so people have money to spend

1428
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,859
there's a spatial division of

1429
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:03,720
consumption what you want is that people

1430
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,140
spend their dollars Euros uh rupees in

1431
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:10,500
your country and your city and not in

1432
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,539
the neighboring City okay

1433
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:14,700
and obviously with globalization this

1434
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,259
this kind of changes you see the

1435
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,540
emergence of global tourism flows etc

1436
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,759
etc so there's a kind of battle if you

1437
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:23,339
will to attract tourists retirees

1438
01:08:23,339 --> 01:08:26,939
there's a whole economy behind Elderly

1439
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:29,759
Homes uh because well these are people

1440
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,120
who have pensions still and they provide

1441
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,219
a safe stream of income

1442
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:36,000
um

1443
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,339
and you could say local consumption

1444
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:39,540
activities

1445
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,520
now there's a contradiction in

1446
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,738
capitalism there because with the crisis

1447
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:47,698
of fordism uh we see a decline in

1448
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:51,000
purchasing power the factor labor is

1449
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,880
typically less powerful

1450
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,920
um so yeah there's there's less less

1451
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,620
money to spend people don't really see

1452
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:02,279
uh an increase in their in their uh real

1453
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:05,880
wages as we've seen in the picture uh on

1454
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,520
New York but this goes back to the 1970s

1455
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,080
for instance when you see pictures of

1456
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,160
the US

1457
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,560
there has been hardly any increase in

1458
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,140
real wages despite huge productivity

1459
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,060
growth okay

1460
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,759
um so this conundrum in many cases being

1461
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:23,120
resolved by

1462
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,960
reverting to uh to credit basically

1463
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,859
um

1464
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:31,500
so instead of kind of buying it from the

1465
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,238
salary that you have

1466
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:34,679
there's an increase to say

1467
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:36,899
financialization of the economy in the

1468
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:39,020
sense that a lot of households become

1469
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,179
dependent on credits mostly through

1470
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:46,859
banks to obtain housing but increasingly

1471
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:49,198
also all other kinds of consumption

1472
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:52,500
Goods Goods washing machines cars etc

1473
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,540
etc

1474
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:56,520
so this is kind of one way of solving

1475
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,340
that that contradiction

1476
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:02,160
um it's also uh trying to attract High

1477
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,460
income jobs uh because yeah they have a

1478
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,040
lot of money to spend uh and what form

1479
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,400
does it take well in many cases uh it

1480
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,080
will have some impact on the social

1481
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,719
spatial structure uh it could be either

1482
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:18,420
state-led gentrification it could be

1483
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,000
market-based gentrification

1484
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,560
um in many cases what you will see is

1485
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,440
that cities will try to uh become more

1486
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,540
attractive one way or another by using

1487
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:31,380
Heritage uh architecture and these are

1488
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,120
things that that you will also talk with

1489
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,640
with boss about cities are kind of

1490
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,260
transformed into these kind of urban

1491
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,280
spectacles that are

1492
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,860
collectively adding more value to the

1493
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,020
goods that are consumed there so if you

1494
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,280
walk around from the spectacular

1495
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,800
neighborhood you might be inclined to

1496
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,000
spend a bit more yes

1497
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,040
yes

1498
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,739
very also really increase the work of

1499
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:07,760
the city like the one in

1500
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:16,739
library and before that the seat was

1501
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:17,520
very

1502
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,860
popular and everyone was not really an

1503
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,719
attraction and part of it

1504
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:24,179
was very interesting yeah yeah yeah no

1505
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:25,860
but it's it's kind of these these

1506
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,620
examples of of landmark buildings uh

1507
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,659
they're they're quite often they're used

1508
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:32,340
in large scale reconversion number one

1509
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,980
is is I think maybe you refer to Bilbao

1510
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,800
all right that's Northern Spain yeah so

1511
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,280
there was an old Industrial Area uh and

1512
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,340
I think it's in the 1990s already

1513
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,840
spectacular urbanism in the sense that

1514
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,060
spectacular architecture usually there's

1515
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,640
some kind of a mobile class of what they

1516
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,340
call start attacks uh who are kind of

1517
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,699
foreign

1518
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:02,219
who connect to these Global circuits and

1519
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:03,960
starts producing these kind of

1520
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,080
spectacular architectural forms that

1521
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,179
then send the message to the world which

1522
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:11,640
can be then uh kind of linked to City

1523
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,460
branding or city marketing strategies

1524
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,800
Etc so the city in and of itself can be

1525
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,920
consumed but also plays a role in

1526
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,699
fueling consumption practices within

1527
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:25,800
okay so that's kind of if you're

1528
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,500
interested uh to hire David Hardy for

1529
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,719
that he can advise you how to do that

1530
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,440
and then the third third one is what he

1531
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,420
says he said there's still

1532
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,760
an element of the previous system there

1533
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,460
but it's kind of transformed so and you

1534
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,300
could say foreign

1535
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,580
to kind of stimulate growth it was still

1536
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,860
capitalist growth for sure across the

1537
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,159
territory somewhat evenly

1538
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:55,620
um so yeah there's you could say General

1539
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,140
taxation there's a fund and it can be

1540
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:01,080
invested across the territory and lower

1541
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,900
level governments can still try to

1542
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,840
attract some of that funding but it

1543
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,060
becomes increasingly you could say

1544
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,360
marketized as well quite often you'll be

1545
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,400
competing with other cities and other

1546
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,100
regions to start to attract these kinds

1547
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,100
of redistributed funds

1548
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,739
um just a number of examples in the U.S

1549
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:25,440
it's it's about where our military and

1550
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,199
defense Investments being made that's

1551
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,480
the story of Silicon Valley in Europe

1552
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,860
there's a lot of competition between

1553
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,420
regions

1554
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,140
um

1555
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,679
for for instance a regional development

1556
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,760
funds which work on both competitiveness

1557
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,659
of of regions but also cohesion so it's

1558
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:47,460
not kind of

1559
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,880
100 evil or something like that but it's

1560
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,620
a mechanism uh to yeah to redistribute

1561
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,719
um these kind of Investments across the

1562
01:13:57,719 --> 01:13:59,820
territory but increase you could say the

1563
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:02,040
capacity of these places for growth and

1564
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,140
at the same time also work towards

1565
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,179
providing amenities

1566
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:08,460
uh Child Care etc etc people that are

1567
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,860
joining me on Friday I'll say a little

1568
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,659
bit more about that in relation to

1569
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:14,940
Brussels the canalso for instance is one

1570
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,460
of these zones of actions uh for the

1571
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:20,580
European uh Regional development effect

1572
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,140
when you look for instance people that

1573
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,420
know Flanders a little bit

1574
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,699
um you have stops feeling spray actin

1575
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:28,739
urban renewal projects

1576
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:31,739
it's kind of led by Flanders

1577
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:32,580
um

1578
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:36,239
and it's it's basically giving money to

1579
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:41,340
uh to cities to reconvert Inner City

1580
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:44,340
neighborhoods okay and quite often you

1581
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:47,280
have to apply uh either you say okay I'm

1582
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,280
going to hand in a concept note so you

1583
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,620
get some some funding to develop your

1584
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,780
idea and then perhaps if you're

1585
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,300
successful later on you can attract uh

1586
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,179
funding by uh by the Flemish government

1587
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,179
but thus far you see that it's mostly uh

1588
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:05,880
the Central City Central stadium so the

1589
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,100
main agglomerations that have the main

1590
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,040
capacity also to apply uh for these

1591
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,179
funds so

1592
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:14,400
it's not that all small cities can

1593
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,219
actually uh benefit from that okay there

1594
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:18,840
was a question

1595
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,840
um

1596
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,600
specifically is redistration Surplus

1597
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,719
like looking at both electric economies

1598
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:31,560
like governments are just financing that

1599
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,800
they're all running down so they're all

1600
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,380
running

1601
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:39,000
deficits yeah deficits so I mean it is

1602
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,260
that's an interesting like just looking

1603
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:43,739
at it like Surplus but really it's like

1604
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,800
making choices about where we're going

1605
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,340
yeah yeah who's going to pay for the

1606
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,860
future yeah but that's yeah okay so

1607
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,780
there's a question okay uh governments

1608
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,280
don't have money how can you be talking

1609
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,780
about Surplus I think what I'm talking

1610
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,340
about is the service that is being

1611
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:02,219
created uh in the economy which is not

1612
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:04,679
necessarily the same as the government

1613
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:06,020
budget

1614
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,420
uh which is under conditions of what I

1615
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:12,540
would call permanent austerity is is

1616
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,580
kept small and then the only thing that

1617
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,739
you can do is is yeah say okay we're

1618
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,560
going to become more efficient and

1619
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,040
that's a a mantra that you hear often or

1620
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,860
basically have very small cuts across

1621
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:29,400
the board so I think uh it used to be

1622
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,260
you could say more

1623
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,320
um in the previous especially to for the

1624
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,540
70s or something like that it's the

1625
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:40,260
allocation problem was smaller because

1626
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:43,440
the fiscal base was was larger there was

1627
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,960
more economic growth which could be more

1628
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,020
easily taxed without you could say

1629
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,600
hurting corporations or people or

1630
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,040
workers it's only at the point uh where

1631
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,980
um you could say and yeah there was a

1632
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:01,800
kind of stagnation of profits that it

1633
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,800
became very hard for governments

1634
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,120
um

1635
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,719
yeah to how would I put this to um to

1636
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:11,880
maintain fiscal levels

1637
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,520
without eating into the profits of of

1638
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,960
the corporations that were still there

1639
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,640
so it's kind of a

1640
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,159
yeah it became a very awkward situation

1641
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:23,100
uh so they they rather kind of cut back

1642
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:27,060
on on expenditures running to increase

1643
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,880
um for instance corporate tax rates so

1644
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,520
that could have been one way of dealing

1645
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,820
with that thinking about uh

1646
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,739
um raising productivity levels in

1647
01:17:37,739 --> 01:17:39,960
another way by investing in technology

1648
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,360
etc etc and that has happened to some

1649
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,179
extent but it hasn't been the answer uh

1650
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:47,280
across the board I think the main

1651
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,520
I would say Trend was to

1652
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,219
keep a check on on the on the wages of

1653
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:55,620
people so yeah that's when I when I talk

1654
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,960
about Surplus is kind of more what kind

1655
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,640
of wealth is created within the

1656
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,500
capitalist system

1657
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,199
rather than more in accountancy terms

1658
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:07,020
what's the does the government run a

1659
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:10,380
surplus or a benefit or or a deficit

1660
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,219
um yeah just to be be clear there

1661
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:17,280
um but yeah despite the fact that even

1662
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,380
if there's the smaller budgets available

1663
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,900
and so the allocation mechanism has

1664
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,800
changed it has become less kind of

1665
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,020
an element of how would I put this

1666
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,880
managing

1667
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,159
kind of growth across the territory it

1668
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,980
has become more of a of a competition

1669
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,080
really and you see for instance these

1670
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,760
urban renewal projects as long as

1671
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,520
there's a competition

1672
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:44,219
to attract These funds to your city

1673
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:47,400
um and that's yeah then you see that it

1674
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,620
leads to some kind of uh Winner Takes a

1675
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:51,900
doll phenomenon I mean Flemish

1676
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,640
government is reflexive about that so

1677
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,440
it's not extreme that it's all to one

1678
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,300
city but still there's a tendency that

1679
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,760
some cities benefit a bit more from that

1680
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,800
than others that's

1681
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,239
that's always dependence

1682
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,600
um yeah

1683
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,900
um I'm taking a lot of time then the the

1684
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,900
next uh kind of final one and then we

1685
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,900
kind of end the excurs and go back

1686
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,600
um to the discussion about command and

1687
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,699
control and world cities the kind of

1688
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:24,360
final strategy is to make sure that in

1689
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,100
the international division of labor in

1690
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,540
these Global production networks and

1691
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,580
Global Financial networks that you hold

1692
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,100
these functions of command and control

1693
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,620
and you can say there's a specific kind

1694
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,960
of entrepreneurialism well you're invest

1695
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,239
in physical connectivity digital

1696
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:43,560
connectivity uh nowadays uh that you

1697
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,659
invest in you could say supply side

1698
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:48,480
economics I heard that a little bit uh

1699
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:53,000
so state of the Arts uh districts

1700
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:55,679
that are there to attract International

1701
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,840
corporations and

1702
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,940
development Central Business districts

1703
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,640
that what I mean with that

1704
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,400
also invest in educating the labor force

1705
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,500
uh thinking about installing business

1706
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,659
schools for instance in Frankfurt one of

1707
01:20:09,659 --> 01:20:13,380
the uh the leading Financial Center in

1708
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,600
um in Germany

1709
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,300
um due to University it has its business

1710
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,760
school financed by Deutsche Bank right

1711
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,280
so and there's lectures uh by people

1712
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,100
working at Deutsche Bank

1713
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:29,100
educating the new generation of critical

1714
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,640
uh social scientists okay

1715
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,620
um so this kind of a dynamic that's

1716
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,480
particularly attaching itself to world

1717
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,120
cities and the kind of idea is that if

1718
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,699
you attract these Global functions it

1719
01:20:41,699 --> 01:20:44,460
will indeed set in motion some kind of a

1720
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,080
trickle-down effect

1721
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,380
it will inflate property prices because

1722
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,659
they will as we have learned with Brad

1723
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:54,420
Christophers they will become a part of

1724
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,280
international portfolios

1725
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:00,060
etc etc so that's kind of the strategy

1726
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,360
that is set there

1727
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,780
okay let's have a quick break uh five

1728
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,520
minutes and then we actually get to the

1729
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,340
polarization thesis which is taking a

1730
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,120
lot of time today

1731
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:20,719
a little bit yeah

1732
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:28,880

an email

1738
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:43,140
or maybe what I can do is just but I

1739
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:46,940
want to avoid that kind of um

1740
01:21:53,179 --> 01:21:56,100
or you can just shout and say who is

1741
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,330
bueno no no no no

1743
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,420
okay yeah I think they have that same

1744
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,340
problem as far because I don't know who

1745
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:07,440
is presenting with me this weekend I

1746
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,719
don't have any ways

1747
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:12,540
thank you ma'am yeah yeah yeah but

1748
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:16,520
normally you can see it uh on canvas

yeah

1750
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,360
okay and it's probably because

1751
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,800
the people in the other group

1752
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,420

01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,320
let's get started again

1777
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:02,480
okay

1778
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,179
so we have this brief excurs learning

1779
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:08,040
about different entrepreneurial

1780
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,080
strategies and I think what I wanted to

1781
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,340
show is that

1782
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:14,219
thank you there's there's a wide

1783
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:16,560
restructuring of the economy and we can

1784
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,560
place growing Global City formation

1785
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,540
within that as one particular strategy

1786
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,920
okay

1787
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,440
or one particular process that is

1788
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,920
explicitly relevant for world cities

1789
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,560
now going back a little bit more to the

1790
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,060
discussion about how does this connect

1791
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,780
to polarization

1792
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:39,239
well as we found there's this and it's

1793
01:29:39,239 --> 01:29:41,159
mostly Friedman and wolf Friedman and

1794
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:42,860
system

1795
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:45,659
uh the starting point was this

1796
01:29:45,659 --> 01:29:48,239
observation of a change in the economic

1797
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:51,540
base generally a decline and well-paid

1798
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:54,000
manufacturing jobs which is some kind of

1799
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,580
an exodus because of globalization of

1800
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:57,480
production

1801
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,900
and at the same time a restructuring of

1802
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:05,159
the economy uh towards services

1803
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:08,219
as we've seen 80 percent of cities is

1804
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:11,159
service based but it's both at the high

1805
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:13,620
end and at the low end both formal

1806
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:16,020
Services service markets and informal

1807
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:18,199
service

1808
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:22,620
so what kind of polarization thesis says

1809
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,120
well there's something particular about

1810
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,719
these commands and control functions

1811
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:28,860
uh

1812
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:31,800
fuels this polarization process please

1813
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,460
take a seat

1814
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,400
okay

1815
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:48,440
[Music]

1816
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:52,340
please do a refill

1817
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,679
so there's something particular about

1818
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,500
these APS and headquarters economies

1819
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,560
that will set a motion polarization

1820
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,420
process okay

1821
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,520
so at one point there's you could say

1822
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,340
competition within the APN APS complex

1823
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:11,460
itself which will lead to

1824
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,800
an idea of Outsourcing getting rid of

1825
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,380
some kind of non-core activities

1826
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:20,940
quite often this leads to low-key kind

1827
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:24,060
of activities that are all and a lot of

1828
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,880
contexts also linked to some form of

1829
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,639
informal economy

1830
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:31,440
and a lot of kind of Migrant labor that

1831
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,040
takes care of routine service charts

1832
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,020
think about cleaning functions think

1833
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,400
about

1834
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,639
um well the Xerox machine and those kind

1835
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:45,600
of things clerical work etc etc

1836
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,300
next to that what you also see is that

1837
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,239
with these high-end functions or these

1838
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:53,040
command and control functions

1839
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,760
it comes with uh the influx of

1840
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,639
wealth salaries people that have a lot

1841
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,120
of spending power that have their own

1842
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:05,699
desire for certain forms of of housing

1843
01:32:05,699 --> 01:32:08,820
quite often the sets in motion bursts of

1844
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:11,040
gentrification so the displacement of

1845
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,100
initial populations

1846
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,719
um and it's also at the level of

1847
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:18,540
consumption Goods of of leisure

1848
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,280
activities that this leads to a

1849
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,560
transformation okay so if you host these

1850
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,960
activities well basically the managers

1851
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,600
the CEOs people in Business Services

1852
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,179
Advanced producer Services well they

1853
01:32:30,179 --> 01:32:31,980
have the whole Ecology of cultural

1854
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:35,400
amenities and hurricane Etc uh so

1855
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,199
there's this also creates some kind of

1856
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,420
demand for

1857
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,139
um low-income jobs to cater quite

1858
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:46,500
literally to these uh Elites there is

1859
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,020
something particular about world cities

1860
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:52,320
which makes that there will be a even

1861
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,159
more augmented process of polarization

1862
01:32:55,159 --> 01:32:59,760
compared to non-world cities or

1863
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:00,300
um

1864
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:03,239
or wider territories okay and the end

1865
01:33:03,239 --> 01:33:06,000
result the ideas is that you get with

1866
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,360
you get a a different structure or

1867
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,340
income distribution in the sense that

1868
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,040
there's a lot of growth of jobs at the

1869
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:17,159
very top there's a growth of jobs at the

1870
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:19,320
at the bottom of the income distribution

1871
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:23,040
and in general because of a decline in

1872
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,880
well-paid well remunerated stable

1873
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,199
manufacturing jobs there's a kind of a

1874
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:30,659
decrease of middle income groups and you

1875
01:33:30,659 --> 01:33:33,179
end up with an hour class okay so

1876
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:36,780
something like that okay

1877
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:39,300
um that when this kind of figure shows

1878
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,980
how that works

1879
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:44,699
it's a bit hard to decipher here but

1880
01:33:44,699 --> 01:33:47,340
there's the growth of M which is kind of

1881
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:51,420
uh managerial class so CEOs of

1882
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:54,000
international corporations link to that

1883
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,239
is p these are kind of the producer

1884
01:33:57,239 --> 01:33:58,800
services or the advanced business

1885
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,360
services that we've been talking about

1886
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,820
and then below that see these are all

1887
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:05,960
kinds of clarable tasks okay

1888
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:09,239
menu tasks and kind of taking care of

1889
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:11,159
administrations

1890
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:14,219
Etc in the current day and age these

1891
01:34:14,219 --> 01:34:15,900
activities are also kind of being

1892
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,000
globalized and offshores and of

1893
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,460
themselves the 1980s there these back

1894
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:23,580
office Works still took place in global

1895
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,840
cities okay

1896
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:28,739
so at the same time you see a growth you

1897
01:34:28,739 --> 01:34:30,780
could say an informal markets or

1898
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:34,139
informal parts of the economy

1899
01:34:34,139 --> 01:34:34,860
um

1900
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:38,760
and these are often also based on

1901
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,940
um on migrantly okay

1902
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:42,840
um

1903
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,060
for instance what we have here I mean

1904
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,520
all these kind of amenities that we were

1905
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,520
talking about hurricane

1906
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,139
letter activities is kind of supported

1907
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:55,280
by that uh there's in informal

1908
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,780
production facilities that are

1909
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:01,440
re-emerging in cities and then yeah

1910
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,480
consumption rules and other kinds of

1911
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,179
things that are also kind of emerging

1912
01:35:06,179 --> 01:35:09,060
there in connection to

1913
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,400
um the rise of this APS complex and

1914
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,040
Global Corporation so in general what

1915
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,620
you need to remember is you have an

1916
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:20,040
exodus of these high-wage manufacturing

1917
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,560
jobs that's what kind of is the main the

1918
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,199
restructuring and the kind of influx of

1919
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:27,600
workers

1920
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,659
um often from uh from a global scale of

1921
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:33,360
foreign migrant workers that quite often

1922
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,840
end up in uh in informal labor markets

1923
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:39,239
and note that I still have this one if

1924
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:41,040
you don't mind how

1925
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,800
big okay so a general restructure of

1926
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,260
this labor market and importantly and

1927
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:47,820
what sets

1928
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:50,280
um women Global cities apart from you

1929
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,260
could say the rest of the territory or

1930
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:54,659
small cities is that this labor market

1931
01:35:54,659 --> 01:35:56,699
becomes globalized

1932
01:35:56,699 --> 01:35:59,340
and it speaks because I have both sides

1933
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:02,580
of uh this hourglass it works at the at

1934
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:05,400
the top level we have the uh the high

1935
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,540
paid

1936
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,659
um migrants and it works also at the

1937
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:12,420
lower end of the income distribution

1938
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:15,300
and quite interestingly

1939
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:18,659
uh sometimes quite cynically there's

1940
01:36:18,659 --> 01:36:20,520
um also different terminologies for that

1941
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:23,400
so people at the high end uh it doesn't

1942
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:26,040
really matter uh or they're kind of not

1943
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,620
seen as immigrants but these are expats

1944
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:31,139
quite often for instance in Belgium they

1945
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:33,840
enjoy quite interesting text regimes

1946
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,600
with the discussion as to whether it

1947
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,300
would be a nice idea to actually tax

1948
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:41,100
expats in Belgium

1949
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,560
um so these are kind of seen as people

1950
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,179
that

1951
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:45,900
um

1952
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,060
that bring in a lot of expertise a lot

1953
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,820
of value that make a city very

1954
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:54,360
competitive uh in this global war for

1955
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:58,020
talent whereas uh people that are more

1956
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:01,920
at in the lower paid jobs are seen as as

1957
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,760
immigrants right uh or foreigners etc

1958
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,320
etc Okay so

1959
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,060
there's a lot of terms of being used

1960
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:10,380
there that are

1961
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,920
take part of a very performative and

1962
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,560
normalizing

1963
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,600
um and normalizing the situation so the

1964
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,719
way we talk about these divisions

1965
01:37:21,719 --> 01:37:24,060
matters I think

1966
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:24,659
um

1967
01:37:24,659 --> 01:37:26,520
so what we see is

1968
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,159
um uh also

1969
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:32,360
growth of of low-skilled

1970
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:37,380
or these skilled uh migrant workers

1971
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:40,560
um so are the people that have little

1972
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,800
qualification in a country of origin and

1973
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:47,159
and come to a world of global City

1974
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:49,920
or people that have qualifications

1975
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,300
but

1976
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,639
for some reason because they cross the

1977
01:37:53,639 --> 01:37:57,239
border have lost proof of that okay so a

1978
01:37:57,239 --> 01:37:59,239
lot of contacts even if you eradicated

1979
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:02,760
in one or one in the other direction

1980
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,340
uh you have to kind of be accredited for

1981
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,739
that right so you have to uh your

1982
01:38:07,739 --> 01:38:10,139
diploma needs to be certified to be able

1983
01:38:10,139 --> 01:38:12,239
to access the labor market in one way or

1984
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:13,980
another

1985
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,900
this in and of itself is quite an

1986
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:18,600
interesting process uh but it means that

1987
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,820
a lot of people especially in informal

1988
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:24,060
uh relative informal migration

1989
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,560
may not be in the position to actually

1990
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,659
do that so they may have all kinds of

1991
01:38:27,659 --> 01:38:29,880
skills but they can't formally use them

1992
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,639
okay so this is a kind of process of

1993
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:34,860
descaling that is that is going on now

1994
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,600
what it creates especially in a place

1995
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,480
where you have a lot of immigration and

1996
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,340
that's that's typically World in global

1997
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:44,639
cities it just creates a very large pool

1998
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:48,719
of people that have a very poor

1999
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:49,440
um

2000
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,540
uh you could say that are that are not

2001
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:54,300
really empowered that that don't have a

2002
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:56,159
bargain power to negotiate a better

2003
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,900
wages

2004
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:00,600
um and if they don't do it well somebody

2005
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,219
else will and that's kind of the the

2006
01:39:02,219 --> 01:39:04,920
notion of a reserve Army of Labor

2007
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,920
a lot of people that are in flux debt

2008
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,100
will basically take any job

2009
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:13,080
and you see in that case you see the

2010
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,139
emergence of what people call 3D jobs

2011
01:39:16,139 --> 01:39:19,080
dirty demanding and dangerous or dirty

2012
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,780
dangerous and difficult uh a lot of

2013
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:24,000
Migrant labor in Roman Global cities

2014
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,159
ends up in uh these kind of segments

2015
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:32,580
and these are typically jobs that people

2016
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:35,820
um that kind of the natives if you will

2017
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:39,060
are unwilling to do

2018
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:41,400
and I mean for instance if you look at

2019
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,400
the whole debate about the fella Fallout

2020
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,139
of brexit

2021
01:39:46,139 --> 01:39:49,880
and it had been driven tremendously by

2022
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,739
anti-immigrant they are stealing our

2023
01:39:52,739 --> 01:39:56,340
jobs sentiment uh and now they're the

2024
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,800
economy is kind of crippled

2025
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,100
by uh not having access to fuel because

2026
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:05,159
there's no truck drivers to actually uh

2027
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:07,380
or migrant truck drives to actually

2028
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:10,080
bring the fuel to to pump stations gas

2029
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,080
stations so you can refill your car so

2030
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,219
it's kind of

2031
01:40:14,219 --> 01:40:18,659
uh history with the Vengeance there

2032
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:20,520
um and it kind of shows The crucial

2033
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,920
dependence of our economy a lot of

2034
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:23,940
cities

2035
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:26,520
in that migrant labor and a lot of

2036
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,000
essential services that is absolutely

2037
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,420
undervalued in societal terms

2038
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:34,860
um

2039
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,840
yeah and then

2040
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,360
what what is actually uh quite

2041
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,400
interesting to see and that's also work

2042
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,739
by Sasuke assassin when she was still

2043
01:40:43,739 --> 01:40:46,920
married hence group

2044
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:49,739
um that yeah

2045
01:40:49,739 --> 01:40:52,020
a lot of these activities are informal

2046
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,659
are connected to floating populations

2047
01:40:54,659 --> 01:40:58,739
people that are residing temporarily in

2048
01:40:58,739 --> 01:41:00,000
cities

2049
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,300
um that may be transmigrants uh move on

2050
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:05,179
one way or another

2051
01:41:05,179 --> 01:41:10,020
and yeah they they form the context of

2052
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,179
you could say potential exploitation

2053
01:41:12,179 --> 01:41:13,920
it's not necessarily happening but it's

2054
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,500
kind of a context where people that want

2055
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,900
to take advantage

2056
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:22,020
um Can more easily do that okay

2057
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:24,199
um it can be

2058
01:41:24,199 --> 01:41:26,520
sometimes for very good reasons to say

2059
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,940
Okay I want to help somebody

2060
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:33,300
and I'll let you clean my house or take

2061
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,580
care of the children and I'll pay you

2062
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,620
the minimum wage or something like that

2063
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:38,940
[Music]

2064
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:41,600
right that could be the position of a

2065
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,820
middle-class family uh in in a global

2066
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:46,920
City but at the same time there's this

2067
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:49,619
structural discrimination of these

2068
01:41:49,619 --> 01:41:52,260
groups in society they may be well

2069
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:55,380
suited to take other jobs at Society but

2070
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:57,719
yeah they're kind of forced into them so

2071
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:00,239
it's kind of in combination with a large

2072
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,980
group of people that are looking for

2073
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:03,719
jobs

2074
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:06,239
um the informal character allows a lot

2075
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:07,199
of

2076
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:10,860
um informal uh potential forms of of

2077
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:12,780
exploitation and this is what substance

2078
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:15,659
calls the peripheralization at the core

2079
01:42:15,659 --> 01:42:18,060
so what she says is that typically we

2080
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,100
think about exploitation as a relation

2081
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,800
between say the global North or the

2082
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,780
global South well actually it's taking

2083
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:27,780
place it re-enters the global North so

2084
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:30,179
in world and Global cities you can also

2085
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:32,280
find this

2086
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:35,880
um these exploitative relations because

2087
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:38,239
the global South is actually

2088
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:39,860
living

2089
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:43,560
in world and Global cities whereas the

2090
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:44,780
relation

2091
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:47,659
remains exported okay so

2092
01:42:47,659 --> 01:42:49,920
peripheralization of the Court just in

2093
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:53,040
figures to to illustrate this is to

2094
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,900
referred a little bit to the research on

2095
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:57,659
this so there's a whole strand of

2096
01:42:57,659 --> 01:43:00,060
research looking into urban belief

2097
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:02,280
Networks

2098
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:04,500
some kind of interesting work by uh

2099
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,659
William Carroll looking at Interlocking

2100
01:43:06,659 --> 01:43:09,840
directorates it's it's one way of

2101
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,460
measuring

2102
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:13,320
um you could say the connections between

2103
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,360
cities

2104
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:15,900
um

2105
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:19,560
by looking at the the overlaps between

2106
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:23,900
the board of directors of Corporation so

2107
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:28,739
one one member of the board sitting on

2108
01:43:28,739 --> 01:43:31,380
different boards so for instance

2109
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:36,480
uh 40 spunk Belgium and BNB buddy bar uh

2110
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:39,300
Paris or something like that and we see

2111
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,219
actually in this picture there's quite a

2112
01:43:41,219 --> 01:43:43,560
strong connection between Brussels and

2113
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,360
Paris but it shows that

2114
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:48,239
yeah uh as we we live in a kind of

2115
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:51,480
global economy as for the corporate

2116
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:54,179
world has globalized there's also you

2117
01:43:54,179 --> 01:43:55,800
could say the social structure there

2118
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:58,860
behind that of a traveling Global Elite

2119
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:00,960
with a lot of power decision making

2120
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,540
power that is connecting this kind of

2121
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:06,000
place okay so if you're board of

2122
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,400
directors of uh and the board of

2123
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,340
directors of 10 or 15 corporations well

2124
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:12,960
you will be

2125
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,460
you say traveling around in first class

2126
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:19,500
uh between these places

2127
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:23,280
uh and and go from Citadel to Citadel if

2128
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,080
you will okay

2129
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:26,639
um I also did a little bit of research

2130
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:29,699
into how this looks and Islamic markets

2131
01:44:29,699 --> 01:44:31,080
and I found actually quite similar

2132
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:34,020
things the geographies look different

2133
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:37,800
um but um what out of that is how

2134
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,739
governance structures work in Islamic

2135
01:44:40,739 --> 01:44:43,560
Banks and there you find that next to

2136
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,719
the typical board of directors you also

2137
01:44:45,719 --> 01:44:48,000
have a Sharia board and these these

2138
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,179
boards basically review to what extent

2139
01:44:51,179 --> 01:44:53,820
the activities of banks are

2140
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:57,840
in line with the Sharia okay so are they

2141
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,139
um hello or are they not considered uh

2142
01:45:01,139 --> 01:45:03,619
Allah

2143
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:06,600
uh yeah it's it's very similar to what I

2144
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,300
found in uh on the previous figure in

2145
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,739
the sense that it's also very

2146
01:45:10,739 --> 01:45:14,100
concentrated uh uh social geography so

2147
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,080
it's very concentrated in a very limited

2148
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:19,199
set of Scholars

2149
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:21,360
um some of them sit on the board 50

2150
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:24,420
different corporations

2151
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:26,100
um which creates all kinds of

2152
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:28,500
interesting things as to to what extent

2153
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:31,260
is this so credible that they will

2154
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:34,080
review uh the Sharia compliant character

2155
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,000
or other things going on

2156
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,219
uh you see there's a connection with New

2157
01:45:38,219 --> 01:45:39,840
York

2158
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,020
um well at some point golden Sachs uh

2159
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:46,199
also was planning to to go into Islamic

2160
01:45:46,199 --> 01:45:47,340
markets and there was a whole

2161
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:51,179
controversy uh as to what extents

2162
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:53,580
um their financial products

2163
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,739
was actually

2164
01:45:55,739 --> 01:45:59,340
um reviewed by by Sharia scholas or

2165
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:01,020
whether this was some kind of reviews

2166
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:04,920
etc etc there was a huge Flashback by

2167
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,800
um

2168
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,860
scores by this entire community and uh

2169
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:12,719
in the end it didn't materialize but

2170
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:15,000
just to show you that there's different

2171
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,739
ways of approaching these Urban lead

2172
01:46:16,739 --> 01:46:19,619
networks but it's it's the existence of

2173
01:46:19,619 --> 01:46:21,420
those kind of structures that allows us

2174
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:23,639
to understand yeah what kind of

2175
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:26,580
activities take place at that level and

2176
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,219
how do you can affect uh say income

2177
01:46:29,219 --> 01:46:30,360
structures because they they're

2178
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:33,199
extremely well remunerated and will

2179
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:36,900
reside in different kind of places

2180
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,119
now at the other end what I was talking

2181
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:41,159
about is this these new forms of

2182
01:46:41,159 --> 01:46:43,080
industrial

2183
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:43,820
um

2184
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:48,659
exploitation uh in these sweatshops

2185
01:46:48,659 --> 01:46:49,500
um

2186
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,179
so yeah what are these kind of

2187
01:46:51,179 --> 01:46:52,679
sweatshops you may have heard of that

2188
01:46:52,679 --> 01:46:55,199
it's kind of the Renaissance of very old

2189
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:58,320
forms of exploitation or industrial

2190
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,960
organization you may have heard about in

2191
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,239
the middle age Middle Ages you had to

2192
01:47:03,239 --> 01:47:05,699
put it out system where people in the

2193
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:07,500
household and were in the countryside

2194
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:11,219
were actually producing uh at the piece

2195
01:47:11,219 --> 01:47:16,080
by piece salary uh textiles for uh for

2196
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,480
capitalists and cities

2197
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:21,300
um it's kind of reinvented in the 20th

2198
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,060
and 21st century and so flat shops are

2199
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:27,540
these small units usually underground uh

2200
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:30,119
or in secluded spaces often in the

2201
01:47:30,119 --> 01:47:31,980
textile industry

2202
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:34,139
uh that works through all these kind of

2203
01:47:34,139 --> 01:47:37,320
sub subcontracting uh deals so you never

2204
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:40,139
quite know who is really hiring people

2205
01:47:40,139 --> 01:47:42,840
so there's different kind of layers of

2206
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:45,480
of governance there uh a lot of people

2207
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:48,840
yeah are indeed paid by the piece or

2208
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:52,800
have daily or weekly contracts uh which

2209
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,440
yeah it's extremely precarious as you

2210
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,659
may understand

2211
01:47:57,659 --> 01:48:00,239
um and yeah we see that it's kind of

2212
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:03,420
re-emerging and it was say the 19th

2213
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:04,380
century

2214
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:07,040
um it took place in a lot of

2215
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,119
industrializing cities

2216
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:12,420
it's went away and for instance in the

2217
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:16,260
U.S you see that because there was all

2218
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:19,020
kind of yeah the trade unions

2219
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:20,820
um initiatives

2220
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:24,840
uh regulations were adapted for instance

2221
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,600
in relation to the to the New Deal

2222
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,800
um just before uh the Second World War

2223
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:34,080
which made this practically impossible

2224
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:37,320
so it was in a context where you had far

2225
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:39,659
less migrant labor but actually possible

2226
01:48:39,659 --> 01:48:42,300
to regulate those markets

2227
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:45,420
but that's kind of returned to the 1990s

2228
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:48,719
this kind of all of a sudden is back at

2229
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:51,360
these are very old data but in the 1990s

2230
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,060
uh calculated I think between four

2231
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:55,860
thousand five hundred and four thousand

2232
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:58,080
five hundred of seven thousand textile

2233
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,239
companies there and then in New York

2234
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:03,300
were actually sweatshops okay so when

2235
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:04,920
you think about world city formation

2236
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,560
it's not just

2237
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,080
um these Glitz and Glam offices with

2238
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:13,020
bankers at the same time it's very old

2239
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:15,000
forms of exploitation that are made

2240
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,960
possible by a complete

2241
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:21,719
absence of any labor rights uh

2242
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:23,639
protection

2243
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:27,600
so yeah uh the places in Chinatown of

2244
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,840
the lower lower east and yeah is this

2245
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:33,840
kind of situations are still occurring

2246
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,320
there okay

2247
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:40,020
now then to turn a little bit to

2248
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:42,900
um I would say criticism or critiques of

2249
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,420
the polarization pieces because it seems

2250
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:47,880
to be a very kind of elegant thesis

2251
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:50,219
right as the the restructuring of the

2252
01:49:50,219 --> 01:49:52,560
economy at the same time there's a

2253
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,080
globalization it leads to attraction of

2254
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,960
headquarters and APS functions and this

2255
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:00,360
kind of adds to a wider process of

2256
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,940
income and rational polarization which

2257
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:05,040
then may also lead to social spatial

2258
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,900
polarization okay because people with

2259
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,940
different kind of income groups may not

2260
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:11,460
necessarily live in the same place quite

2261
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:13,260
on the contrary if they have very

2262
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:14,760
different Lifestyles they may want to

2263
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:16,800
live something else

2264
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,139
same time also the empirical base is

2265
01:50:19,139 --> 01:50:22,739
mostly linked to a limited set of of

2266
01:50:22,739 --> 01:50:25,980
cases New York London Tokyo so

2267
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:28,500
especially in the 1990s when

2268
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:31,260
this became a major debate the question

2269
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:36,060
is is Susan right uh or is something

2270
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:38,520
wrong to put it in the words of Chris

2271
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:41,400
Hamlet who is also one of one of you say

2272
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,800
the main counter voices in this debate

2273
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:46,080
so for instance according to to hamnet

2274
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,239
yeah he's very critical of this term

2275
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:50,760
polarization as we also briefly

2276
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:52,199
discussed before

2277
01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:54,480
he says well it's an all-purpose General

2278
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,360
signifier

2279
01:50:56,360 --> 01:51:00,179
and in the end yeah it doesn't really

2280
01:51:00,179 --> 01:51:02,719
explain much and we don't

2281
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,920
necessarily neatly describe what is

2282
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,440
going on in particular world cities

2283
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:10,139
so what it says is that next to

2284
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:11,880
polarization

2285
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,520
this other process is thinking thinkable

2286
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,280
right we can think about

2287
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:18,960
proletarianization so that's the

2288
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,900
emergence of say

2289
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:24,540
an exploited underclass if you will to

2290
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:27,420
use that term in society as the main

2291
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:28,619
Trend or it could also be

2292
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:31,080
professionalization which somehow refers

2293
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:34,139
to social Mobility

2294
01:51:34,139 --> 01:51:37,080
um the rise of middle income jobs etc

2295
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:39,900
etc so instead of assuming that world

2296
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,360
and Global City formation necessarily

2297
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:45,600
produces polarization it's actually a

2298
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,219
research question empirical question

2299
01:51:47,219 --> 01:51:51,540
what is going on uh in cities Okay so

2300
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:54,840
rather than just saying okay uh this is

2301
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:59,040
a piece or or a given fact it may be a

2302
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:02,100
hypothesis to see to what extent we see

2303
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,619
evidence of polarization or where do we

2304
01:52:04,619 --> 01:52:06,480
see other things happening and one way

2305
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,820
of doing that is also taking more into

2306
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:11,760
account the occupational structure and

2307
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,060
the spatial structure of cities

2308
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:17,580
so to tell a bit more about this

2309
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:21,000
occupational structure uh what it talks

2310
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,100
about Chris hamnet and this is kind of

2311
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:27,060
an interesting evolution in the 1990s uh

2312
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:30,179
he mostly looked at the case of London

2313
01:52:30,179 --> 01:52:33,300
uh and he says well

2314
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:35,639
what we find in New York

2315
01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:37,980
are not necessarily necessarily find

2316
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:40,500
that in the case of London there's

2317
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,020
actually very little polarization what I

2318
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:45,900
find is professionalization okay

2319
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:48,719
so yes there's a growth of high income

2320
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:49,860
jobs

2321
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:52,980
but it's not necessarily linked to an

2322
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:56,400
explosion of jobs at the bottom so it's

2323
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:59,159
it's not really an hourglass at the same

2324
01:52:59,159 --> 01:53:02,100
time we also see evidence of a growth in

2325
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:04,280
Middle income jobs

2326
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,920
and a lot of people

2327
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:10,920
can make can move up you could say the

2328
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:14,880
occupational structure can be trained uh

2329
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,060
it can get a training

2330
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:22,080
um and are professionalizing

2331
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,960
um so yeah he doesn't find the pattern

2332
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,920
of of what what was assumed to be the

2333
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:32,460
the two expected pattern of New York at

2334
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:33,900
the same time he says well it could be

2335
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:38,460
related to the fact that migration is

2336
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:41,400
there and then far less the case

2337
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:45,480
um it's also uncomparable to uh what you

2338
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,239
find in New York so you had migration

2339
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:51,659
obviously uh to London but it was less

2340
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:54,239
globalized it was mostly linked you

2341
01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:55,679
could say too

2342
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:59,699
the remnants of Empire but it wasn't of

2343
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:02,580
the scale of what you found in New York

2344
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:05,159
and so he says yeah there's also a much

2345
01:54:05,159 --> 01:54:08,000
more generous welfare state

2346
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,159
when you compare it to what you had in

2347
01:54:11,159 --> 01:54:12,420
New York so

2348
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:15,300
no this is okay let's not exaggerate we

2349
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,280
don't really fight polarization other

2350
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:21,600
pathways are actually thinkable

2351
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,060
um and then

2352
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:27,840
what we actually uh kind of find them in

2353
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,460
such context is that

2354
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:30,179
um

2355
01:54:30,179 --> 01:54:32,400
it might be something that's kind of

2356
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,619
more intersects with

2357
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:35,460
um

2358
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:39,480
you could say uh process of privilege

2359
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:43,500
that intersects with gender roles in uh

2360
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,780
and society and this benefit so it's

2361
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:49,199
it's less uh the whole discussion about

2362
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:52,199
yes does this APS complex that that

2363
01:54:52,199 --> 01:54:54,060
start to transform the entire labor

2364
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:56,520
market now it's actually wider

2365
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:00,540
dimensions of of uh gender and ethnicity

2366
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:03,000
which is in society that will explain

2367
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,639
what we find in labor markets so for

2368
01:55:05,639 --> 01:55:08,400
instance Joy by Susan uh Feinstein

2369
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:12,000
and colleagues they they look at uh the

2370
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,139
exclusion uh by female labor in high-end

2371
01:55:16,139 --> 01:55:19,980
jobs or for instance the work by uh by

2372
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:21,420
John Wills

2373
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:23,580
um no John May and colleagues I forgot

2374
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:27,800
what the first name of the co-water is

2375
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:32,040
is to say okay look we have to look much

2376
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,139
more at ethnicity to understand what is

2377
01:55:34,139 --> 01:55:36,119
going on because

2378
01:55:36,119 --> 01:55:38,820
um for instance one third of of London's

2379
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:41,820
Filipino population is actually in

2380
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:44,219
Health and Social care Brazilians are in

2381
01:55:44,219 --> 01:55:46,980
cleaning services uh

2382
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:53,119
sick are are hired as as security guards

2383
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:55,980
algerians are running

2384
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:59,400
um the Metro System etc etc okay so

2385
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:01,440
these kind of more General processes

2386
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:04,020
will tell us much more about what is

2387
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:06,119
going on

2388
01:56:06,119 --> 01:56:08,040
what we find is that when you start

2389
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,980
looking at more recent work at London

2390
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:14,820
is that yeah this whole argument that

2391
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:16,920
that longness somehow excluded or

2392
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:20,719
protected from processes of polarization

2393
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:24,179
doesn't really seem to hold yeah there's

2394
01:56:24,179 --> 01:56:25,380
a question

2395
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:28,380
uh

2396
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:43,260
yeah like a shadow economy or something

2397
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:46,260
yeah I think that's one of the reasons

2398
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:49,100
uh that's a very good point and I think

2399
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:51,360
that's one of the differences between

2400
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,940
for instance the work of John May and

2401
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:58,020
colleagues and the conclusions by Chris

2402
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:01,020
Hamner who is focusing on formal

2403
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:02,940
occupational structures

2404
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:05,340
so indeed that's the first point

2405
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:07,860
methodological question is there's

2406
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:09,900
basically a result of the data that is

2407
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:11,119
being used

2408
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:15,000
and actually what you find is that uh in

2409
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,980
the article that was in the reader which

2410
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:20,580
is a way more recent one he also admits

2411
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:23,099
that process of polarization are going

2412
01:57:23,099 --> 01:57:27,840
on in London okay so it's kind of um he

2413
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:31,500
has seen the light Chris Hamlet and

2414
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:33,119
that's kind of yeah just referring to

2415
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:35,580
this paper is kind of I find a very

2416
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:36,780
interesting paper because it really

2417
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:40,440
targets uh migrant groups here in the

2418
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:43,380
sense that they look at at remuneration

2419
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:46,699
and the kind of jobs that are being done

2420
01:57:46,699 --> 01:57:49,440
by people that typically are not part of

2421
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,659
visual statistics

2422
01:57:51,659 --> 01:57:52,380
um

2423
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:56,040
and yeah it's kind of it's kind of hard

2424
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,659
to draw conclusions from that and say

2425
01:57:57,659 --> 01:57:59,880
okay uh for instance if you look at this

2426
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:02,400
picture yeah this kind of showing the

2427
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,340
the division across different kind of uh

2428
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:10,560
rage groups so they they yeah collected

2429
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:14,159
responses by over 300

2430
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:19,800
uh uh people in informal markets

2431
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:20,760
um

2432
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,940
yeah you find that only nine percent

2433
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:26,940
actually uh earns the living wage right

2434
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:28,679
so it's it's

2435
01:58:28,679 --> 01:58:31,560
it really shows that there's an overlay

2436
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:35,340
between the migrant labor and poor

2437
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,380
working conditions but at the same time

2438
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:40,320
it doesn't give you an overview of the

2439
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,000
entire structure of the labor market so

2440
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,219
it's kind of a yeah it can't draw

2441
01:58:44,219 --> 01:58:46,139
systemic conclusions from that but if

2442
01:58:46,139 --> 01:58:47,820
you for instance compare it to this kind

2443
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:50,820
of picture which is not about income but

2444
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:52,199
there's about

2445
01:58:52,199 --> 01:58:55,199
uh job quality so it's a very rough

2446
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:59,460
marker of you could say yeah where in

2447
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:01,860
the say social hierarchy or occupational

2448
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:03,780
hierarchy are we at

2449
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:05,760
there you see that there's actually a

2450
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:08,520
growth at uh in the kind of the the

2451
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:11,219
shooting jobs if you will

2452
01:59:11,219 --> 01:59:15,000
um a stagnation will be prime of normal

2453
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,300
decent jobs and a large growth at the at

2454
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:20,880
the top okay so and these kind of

2455
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,500
indicators that that they would

2456
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,719
occupational structure it's counter

2457
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:27,960
evidence towards professionalization so

2458
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:30,980
I think what happens here is that

2459
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:34,440
when Chris Hammond was writing his his

2460
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:37,860
argument against Susan in the 1990s it

2461
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:39,840
may have still been true

2462
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,619
it may be have been biased by looking at

2463
01:59:43,619 --> 01:59:47,580
formal statistics not capturing what was

2464
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:50,099
going on at the bottom because it was

2465
01:59:50,099 --> 01:59:51,840
basically part of the informal economy

2466
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,900
but then even with that

2467
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:58,320
as time has passed the picture uh even

2468
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,060
in the formal Market would would no

2469
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:01,739
longer look as he would have described

2470
02:00:01,739 --> 02:00:04,440
it so it's kind of a process of of

2471
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:06,960
restructuring that has um that has only

2472
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,420
been initiated later I think compared to

2473
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:11,840
to report

2474
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:15,360
okay but in any case I think

2475
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,340
um it's also not necessarily the points

2476
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:22,500
uh to say okay assassin is right or uh

2477
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:25,139
or Hamlet is wrong point is that we have

2478
02:00:25,139 --> 02:00:26,280
to

2479
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:29,099
identify different process that can

2480
02:00:29,099 --> 02:00:30,840
actually take place at the same time so

2481
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:33,659
you can imagine ant polarization and

2482
02:00:33,659 --> 02:00:35,400
professionalization at the same time

2483
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:38,280
it's not because you see polarization

2484
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:40,199
that some

2485
02:00:40,199 --> 02:00:41,940
segments of the population actually

2486
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:45,239
undergo social Mobility uh in fact it

2487
02:00:45,239 --> 02:00:46,500
could actually be quite an interesting

2488
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:48,480
question in the context of

2489
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,699
polarization who is still able to

2490
02:00:50,699 --> 02:00:53,219
improve oneself on the labor market and

2491
02:00:53,219 --> 02:00:55,800
who is who is not so it's kind I think

2492
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:57,659
that for me was kind of the gist of of

2493
02:00:57,659 --> 02:01:00,960
the article uh by Chris Hamlet's uh

2494
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,340
there

2495
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:04,679
okay let me move on because uh again

2496
02:01:04,679 --> 02:01:07,380
running out of time

2497
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:09,599
um so yeah looking more closely at the

2498
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:11,659
occupational structure I I can't

2499
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,239
possibly go beyond that but it gives you

2500
02:01:15,239 --> 02:01:17,520
a hint of what to look for the second

2501
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:21,000
element is spatial structure right so a

2502
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,920
very important critique Prince by Susan

2503
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:28,320
Feinstein is uh to what extent are the

2504
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,659
result of polarization is also a

2505
02:01:30,659 --> 02:01:32,880
statistical artifact and there's a lot

2506
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,900
of focus on on cities

2507
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:39,900
but we at the same time we know that

2508
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:41,940
middle classes have been suburbanizing

2509
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:45,300
or are still suburbanizing so maybe this

2510
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:48,840
whole disappearance of middle-income

2511
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:50,940
jobs from cities and the fact that you

2512
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:52,500
end up with a very polarized labor

2513
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:54,480
market it could be some kind of an

2514
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,639
artifact

2515
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:58,920
um so yeah I think that's something to

2516
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:01,320
to take into account that's also why

2517
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:03,300
it's interesting to compare you could

2518
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:06,599
say differences between what we did in

2519
02:02:06,599 --> 02:02:09,360
New York State versus New York City I

2520
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,699
think you can't say that there's no

2521
02:02:11,699 --> 02:02:14,460
General Trend in kind of a decline of

2522
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:16,500
middle income jobs for instance in the

2523
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:19,440
case of of the US

2524
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,420
um but it's perhaps less accentuated

2525
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:24,239
than if you only look at at a very neat

2526
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:26,940
uh City Center okay so there's always an

2527
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:28,920
a possibility that wealth is

2528
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:30,840
suburbanized and would give you a

2529
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:32,159
different question so

2530
02:02:32,159 --> 02:02:34,980
scale matters space matters in the sense

2531
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:37,380
that you have to be aware that you need

2532
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:40,040
to kind of map the appropriate

2533
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:43,440
metropolitan area to to understand the

2534
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,000
entire structure of the labor market

2535
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,380
okay

2536
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:49,440
no yeah and everything can go many ways

2537
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:50,639
and sense that you also have to be

2538
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:52,739
sensitive to what extents

2539
02:02:52,739 --> 02:02:53,580
um

2540
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:56,159
uh you could say these higher incomes

2541
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:58,139
will drive gentrification there has been

2542
02:02:58,139 --> 02:03:01,280
a whole process of moving out of cities

2543
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:04,020
uh but there's also been a return to the

2544
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,780
city when you take a city like Brussels

2545
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:09,360
I think I would say it's around a few

2546
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:11,040
thousand there has been a return of

2547
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:13,340
middle incomes and a lot of places

2548
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:16,139
really leading world cities has been

2549
02:03:16,139 --> 02:03:18,119
returned of the super rich

2550
02:03:18,119 --> 02:03:21,360
uh setting in motion motion process of

2551
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,280
what Loretta Lee Schools super

2552
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:26,040
gentrification in just one example of

2553
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:28,260
that is and I refer to that on the map

2554
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:30,000
uh Brooklyn

2555
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,780
used to be you could say uh a nice uh

2556
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:38,219
suburb uh off of New York just across uh

2557
02:03:38,219 --> 02:03:41,280
the river which was still affordable and

2558
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,199
you could deliver these Brown stones but

2559
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:44,960
what she described is

2560
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:51,239
how actually the the top uh earners in

2561
02:03:51,239 --> 02:03:53,280
New York are increasing we're

2562
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,860
increasingly buying in uh in these

2563
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:57,900
property markets so we see that almost

2564
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,820
half of

2565
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:02,820
um of all Brooklyn was owned by the top

2566
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:06,360
10 okay and that in that period you see

2567
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:09,179
a tremendous growth in or inflation of

2568
02:04:09,179 --> 02:04:12,300
property values in that period so you

2569
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,219
really have to look at the detailed

2570
02:04:14,219 --> 02:04:17,760
level uh within a city how uh you can

2571
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,920
say these higher incomes

2572
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:22,199
yeah what kind of spatial process they

2573
02:04:22,199 --> 02:04:25,080
set in motion and sometimes at least a

2574
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:26,219
gentrification of inner city

2575
02:04:26,219 --> 02:04:28,260
neighborhoods it may be more peripheral

2576
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:31,739
processes etc etc so there's no Unified

2577
02:04:31,739 --> 02:04:34,800
spatial structure there it's just a

2578
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,139
question if we have a restructure of the

2579
02:04:37,139 --> 02:04:38,460
economy

2580
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:40,980
where does it spatially attaches itself

2581
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,239
okay

2582
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:45,260
another example is for instance Brussels

2583
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:49,380
where we find that let's say voltage

2584
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:52,159
information and process often

2585
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:54,659
europeanization of the economy and all

2586
02:04:54,659 --> 02:04:56,159
kind of functions that are linked to

2587
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:58,800
that how it has kind of reinforced

2588
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,679
existing social spatial divides and this

2589
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:04,739
is worked by uh now admitted to a

2590
02:05:04,739 --> 02:05:07,440
professor from KU live and discussed a

2591
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,400
lot

2592
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:11,159
uh who looked at

2593
02:05:11,159 --> 02:05:14,099
um at the evolution of you could say

2594
02:05:14,099 --> 02:05:17,099
migrants populations and expat

2595
02:05:17,099 --> 02:05:19,260
populations sorry for that divide again

2596
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:23,639
but it's it's being used in reality

2597
02:05:23,639 --> 02:05:25,860
um in in Brussels and what you see is

2598
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:26,820
that

2599
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:27,659
um

2600
02:05:27,659 --> 02:05:29,159
uh you could say typically the

2601
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:32,520
population with with a lower income

2602
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:35,820
um the Moroccan population has has grown

2603
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:38,719
in the western partner western part of

2604
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:41,840
the city

2605
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:48,540
and the poor Crescent which is kind of

2606
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:50,460
the leading imaginary there also with

2607
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:53,540
policy makers uh whereas you could say

2608
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:56,840
europeanization has attracted a lot of

2609
02:05:56,840 --> 02:06:00,420
expats uh mostly Americans and other

2610
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:02,719
kind of um

2611
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:05,880
people from the European Union mostly

2612
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:09,000
settled in the Southeastern part of

2613
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,540
um of Brussels and what Chris castellope

2614
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:16,020
explains is that in this geography it's

2615
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:18,719
kind of reproducing earlier rounds of

2616
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:22,080
division in Brussels

2617
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:25,199
um it's kind of no coincidence that

2618
02:06:25,199 --> 02:06:28,139
people with a Moroccan uh ethnicity end

2619
02:06:28,139 --> 02:06:31,380
up in the Northwest it has something to

2620
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:33,780
do with the wider process of of Migrant

2621
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:37,139
labor guest Labor uh from the 1950s and

2622
02:06:37,139 --> 02:06:38,940
60s

2623
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:40,560
I can say a lot about that but the

2624
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,480
bottom line is Belgian government

2625
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:45,840
actually uh went to Morocco but also

2626
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:49,020
Turkey Greece Italy to

2627
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:50,699
um to really

2628
02:06:50,699 --> 02:06:53,460
you could say brand Belgium as the place

2629
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:55,020
to work

2630
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:57,420
um a lot of of Migrant Services broader

2631
02:06:57,420 --> 02:07:00,000
families they were seen as temporary

2632
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,460
guest workers and the empties people

2633
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:04,860
decided yes we were going to build a

2634
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:06,000
family here

2635
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,460
uh and he actually well uh worked in all

2636
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:10,260
kinds of productive activities in

2637
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:11,880
Brussels

2638
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:15,780
who with the crisis of the 1960s 70s

2639
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:18,360
uh ended so the the you could say

2640
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:20,520
globalization of production also had a

2641
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:24,119
huge impact on these kind of jobs so a

2642
02:07:24,119 --> 02:07:26,520
lot of these migrant workers

2643
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:28,500
were faced with structural unemployment

2644
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:30,900
and were kind of locked in into these

2645
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:34,800
situations uh and yeah never really got

2646
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,199
out of there okay so there's there's

2647
02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:38,280
still

2648
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:39,119
um

2649
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:42,659
uh provides unemployment rates

2650
02:07:42,659 --> 02:07:46,320
um and what we find is that with the

2651
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:49,260
restructuring of the economy just at the

2652
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:50,940
time when new kind of jobs were being

2653
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:53,159
created there were the jobs that were

2654
02:07:53,159 --> 02:07:56,280
not really matching the the profile of

2655
02:07:56,280 --> 02:07:57,780
these guest workers so there was a lot

2656
02:07:57,780 --> 02:08:00,659
of of service work

2657
02:08:00,659 --> 02:08:03,420
um and yeah I mean it required training

2658
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:06,599
which was not necessarily offered to

2659
02:08:06,599 --> 02:08:08,219
make that transition within one

2660
02:08:08,219 --> 02:08:09,840
generation so

2661
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:12,179
that's why you kind of see this this

2662
02:08:12,179 --> 02:08:15,840
kind of pattern uh reproduce so the

2663
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,580
argument by Chris gas float is that we

2664
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:19,860
should really uh look also into

2665
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:20,580
um

2666
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:23,520
looking at the continuities uh in these

2667
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:25,739
spatial structures you for instance also

2668
02:08:25,739 --> 02:08:27,119
find that

2669
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:30,300
um in in contemporary Elite geographies

2670
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:32,699
and kind of continuing a little bit the

2671
02:08:32,699 --> 02:08:34,679
work by Chris Castle but then focusing

2672
02:08:34,679 --> 02:08:38,159
on say the the upper stratum if you will

2673
02:08:38,159 --> 02:08:40,860
uh we looked at cultural patronage

2674
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:43,880
activities which is basically

2675
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:47,040
a method to identify people with a lot

2676
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:49,860
of money or that think about themselves

2677
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:52,800
as being distinct by consuming high-end

2678
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,719
cultural activity so we basically went

2679
02:08:54,719 --> 02:08:58,199
to uh La moner

2680
02:08:58,199 --> 02:09:00,199
um

2681
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:06,320
uh what is it again uh Elizabeth

2682
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:08,820
so you have all kinds of highbrow

2683
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:11,400
cultural activities uh in Brussels

2684
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:14,040
taking place we also went to Bazaar we

2685
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:16,380
tried to identify who is actually on the

2686
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:20,219
big friend list uh who is sponsoring

2687
02:09:20,219 --> 02:09:22,800
these uh high-end cultural institutions

2688
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:25,800
I mean these fees are not kind of super

2689
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:28,380
spectacular I think sometimes we find

2690
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:30,239
it's kind of you become a big fan of

2691
02:09:30,239 --> 02:09:33,420
bizarre I think it was 12 500 euros per

2692
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:36,719
year so it's not kind of Jeff Jeff Bezos

2693
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:38,159
but at the same time it's not something

2694
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:41,460
that you could spend on a normal salary

2695
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:44,880
so you that was kind of used as a as a

2696
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:47,280
kind of Criterion to kind of find a

2697
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:49,380
group that that has both you could say

2698
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:52,280
cultural capital uh and also economic

2699
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:54,659
what we found then is that and that was

2700
02:09:54,659 --> 02:09:56,219
actually quite interesting that the two

2701
02:09:56,219 --> 02:09:58,139
these kind of methods you could actually

2702
02:09:58,139 --> 02:10:01,320
identify where these people live and we

2703
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:04,080
actually I mean boss and I uh took our

2704
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:07,739
pipes and went taken pictures uh I could

2705
02:10:07,739 --> 02:10:11,400
actually uh at the plot level identify

2706
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:13,380
where where Elites were living

2707
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:15,060
do you find kind of interesting

2708
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:16,679
clusterings there

2709
02:10:16,679 --> 02:10:19,139
and it's all very much concentrated in

2710
02:10:19,139 --> 02:10:21,540
and actually in a city neighborhood so

2711
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:24,960
most of the kind of Roads led to uh to

2712
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:27,380
this kind of area around

2713
02:10:27,380 --> 02:10:31,679
and those kind of areas so we identified

2714
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:34,020
that our Elites are very Urban if you

2715
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:36,540
will and the other place was kind of

2716
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:40,440
more uh Suburban but still within the

2717
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:42,800
Russell's Capital Region with spookular

2718
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,739
which is more like villain neighborhood

2719
02:10:46,739 --> 02:10:47,639
um

2720
02:10:47,639 --> 02:10:50,340
uh so it's kind of a distinct uh way of

2721
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:52,320
life but it's kind of interesting that

2722
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,780
the the major we could say segregation

2723
02:10:54,780 --> 02:10:57,420
process that you find in terms of gated

2724
02:10:57,420 --> 02:11:00,179
communities those kind of things this is

2725
02:11:00,179 --> 02:11:02,159
not something that you

2726
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:04,199
easily find in Brussels these things

2727
02:11:04,199 --> 02:11:06,719
exist in Brussels but it's not

2728
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:10,860
yeah it's not the Sao Paulo or Rio de

2729
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:13,139
Janeiro or this kind of thing so it's

2730
02:11:13,139 --> 02:11:14,460
really

2731
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:17,520
um Happening by micro mechanisms at the

2732
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,980
Block Level that is kind of segregation

2733
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:22,760
is is going on

2734
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:25,980
no just those were just a few examples

2735
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:29,099
to take into account uh histories of

2736
02:11:29,099 --> 02:11:32,040
spatial structure that may matter

2737
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:34,980
now drawing into a close I think what I

2738
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:39,360
want to say is that yeah how to explain

2739
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:42,239
um we could say inequality polarization

2740
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:43,800
etc etc I think we've learned that

2741
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:45,960
polarization it's just one way of one

2742
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:49,440
outcome of this process is we need some

2743
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:51,480
kind of an analytical or explanatory

2744
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:52,920
model for that

2745
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:55,440
Hannah and I want to draw on birds and

2746
02:11:55,440 --> 02:11:58,020
mustard here and I find it's still quite

2747
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:59,520
interesting because they they're working

2748
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:01,739
kind of three ways they said look

2749
02:12:01,739 --> 02:12:04,260
there's at the macro level a level of

2750
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:06,900
global change the economy in general is

2751
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:08,880
restructuring it could be financializing

2752
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:11,580
this uh new international division of

2753
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:14,040
labor etc etc so that's happening at the

2754
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:15,659
macro level there's also at the

2755
02:12:15,659 --> 02:12:17,639
individual level

2756
02:12:17,639 --> 02:12:20,340
due to personal characteristics choices

2757
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:21,199
Etc

2758
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:24,659
patterns habits cultures you may uh have

2759
02:12:24,659 --> 02:12:25,739
different kind of Labor Market

2760
02:12:25,739 --> 02:12:27,900
opportunities

2761
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:30,179
um there's a lot of noise there it's

2762
02:12:30,179 --> 02:12:31,679
hard to study

2763
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:34,080
um in a systematic way but we need to

2764
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:36,000
acknowledge that but what is kind of

2765
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,860
interesting is how the micro and the

2766
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:40,080
micro kind of connected by this medium

2767
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:42,360
level level of analysis

2768
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:44,400
because it's kind of the interface

2769
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:46,679
between Global process and local process

2770
02:12:46,679 --> 02:12:49,500
so we can think about how ethnicity

2771
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:51,840
gender and those kind of things will

2772
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,840
structure access to the labor market and

2773
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:56,940
positionality in the labor market as

2774
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:58,920
that labor market is being restructured

2775
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:00,719
we have to acknowledge National

2776
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:02,880
differences

2777
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:04,800
um we talked about yeah the rise of

2778
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:06,659
neoliberalization

2779
02:13:06,659 --> 02:13:09,300
it hasn't materialized in the same way

2780
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,760
or at the same time in different kind of

2781
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:14,159
spaces there's large differences still

2782
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:16,079
between more you could say

2783
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:18,260
Social Democratic

2784
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:20,460
or at least

2785
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:24,420
light versions of social democracy

2786
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:27,179
um Princeton Continental Europe compared

2787
02:13:27,179 --> 02:13:30,020
to the UK or the US

2788
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:31,739
so

2789
02:13:31,739 --> 02:13:34,260
in Continental Europe in many places

2790
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:37,380
there's still quite a solid social

2791
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:41,280
security system uh minimum wages etc etc

2792
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:43,920
and we kind of identify these are kind

2793
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:48,440
of crucial elements in explaining uh

2794
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:51,780
oh my God promo federalization is

2795
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:54,239
getting late so if you have these kind

2796
02:13:54,239 --> 02:13:57,900
of security measures in place it will

2797
02:13:57,900 --> 02:13:59,880
immediately kind of prevent at least

2798
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:03,179
informal markets uh that you have a an

2799
02:14:03,179 --> 02:14:04,980
explosion at the bottom

2800
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:07,739
um so yeah that's that's something to

2801
02:14:07,739 --> 02:14:09,780
take into account and also clearly even

2802
02:14:09,780 --> 02:14:12,000
within National context you need to look

2803
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,099
at the functions and that's connecting

2804
02:14:14,099 --> 02:14:17,699
back today with Harvey uh cities have

2805
02:14:17,699 --> 02:14:19,079
different kind of functions and that

2806
02:14:19,079 --> 02:14:21,420
will also shape its trajectory if you

2807
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:23,159
look at city like Detroit or Charlotte

2808
02:14:23,159 --> 02:14:27,360
War it's not so likely that these places

2809
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,219
will now become leading Global

2810
02:14:29,219 --> 02:14:32,280
commandment control centers okay

2811
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:35,280
um because they don't simply don't have

2812
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:39,060
that uh that economic trajectory so

2813
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:41,159
that's something this positionality in

2814
02:14:41,159 --> 02:14:44,119
global economic systems has also been

2815
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:47,699
taken into account concluding then I

2816
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:50,340
think yeah the future how would it look

2817
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:51,900
like

2818
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:54,599
um this kind of freewheeling here but

2819
02:14:54,599 --> 02:14:57,000
it's it's kind of lightly and you can

2820
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,440
see in the you know kind of current

2821
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:01,800
developments uh in cities also amid

2822
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:04,440
covet is that it's very likely that

2823
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:07,139
these growing inequalities are only

2824
02:15:07,139 --> 02:15:09,300
going to increase

2825
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:12,739
according to me you see that austerity

2826
02:15:12,739 --> 02:15:17,460
has been temporarily kind of uh forced

2827
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:19,380
there's a lot of intervention linked to

2828
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:21,480
covet there's again a discourse of a

2829
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:22,980
strong state

2830
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:26,340
but as you saw that you immediately send

2831
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:28,440
a lot of official documents that it had

2832
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:31,079
to be temporary and now you see a return

2833
02:15:31,079 --> 02:15:33,540
to a kind of discourse that there will

2834
02:15:33,540 --> 02:15:35,639
be again budget cuts need to be made et

2835
02:15:35,639 --> 02:15:38,940
cetera etc for instance in Flanders we

2836
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:42,060
are preparing the digi from the digi

2837
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:44,099
jump so our education needs to go

2838
02:15:44,099 --> 02:15:45,239
digital

2839
02:15:45,239 --> 02:15:48,119
but at the same time we have to have a

2840
02:15:48,119 --> 02:15:50,579
budget cut of 100 million euro

2841
02:15:50,579 --> 02:15:52,260
so

2842
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:54,840
okay how do you marry those two I mean

2843
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:57,300
for sure there's ways to become more

2844
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:59,940
efficient but at the same time it's not

2845
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:01,619
really credible okay

2846
02:16:01,619 --> 02:16:05,520
uh so nothing really has changed I think

2847
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:08,820
in this micro narrative uh of austerity

2848
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:11,480
so that's that's kind of continuing

2849
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:14,639
and uh you could say the flexibilization

2850
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:17,760
of the labor market it's still also

2851
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:20,639
progressing okay

2852
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:22,560
uh it will be different in different

2853
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:25,739
kind of contexts but it's it's it's not

2854
02:16:25,739 --> 02:16:29,099
really going away uh migration as you

2855
02:16:29,099 --> 02:16:30,780
know

2856
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:33,000
um and this is linked obviously to to

2857
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,920
wider issues such as uh uh Global change

2858
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:40,859
will simply be more people that will

2859
02:16:40,859 --> 02:16:42,959
have to rely on migration to still make

2860
02:16:42,959 --> 02:16:44,040
a living

2861
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:47,160
uh which also means in a lot of cities

2862
02:16:47,160 --> 02:16:48,840
if you don't work on Social Security

2863
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:52,080
minimum wage etc etc you will don't you

2864
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:54,420
won't do anything about the uh the whole

2865
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:56,280
discussion about the reserve Army of

2866
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:58,260
Labor so these conditions for

2867
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:00,299
exploitation

2868
02:17:00,299 --> 02:17:02,879
will remain in place

2869
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:05,218
so that's kind of working at the at the

2870
02:17:05,218 --> 02:17:06,959
bottom end if you will

2871
02:17:06,959 --> 02:17:09,840
at the same time at the top end uh and

2872
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,280
it's kind of returning a little bit to

2873
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:12,540
the whole discussion about income

2874
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:14,580
distribution at the very start

2875
02:17:14,580 --> 02:17:16,679
we see that there's some kind of Return

2876
02:17:16,679 --> 02:17:19,679
of the Gilded Age has

2877
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:22,978
um Thomas picketti calls it so a period

2878
02:17:22,978 --> 02:17:25,740
in the in the 20th century where in the

2879
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:30,058
19th century sorry uh where a lot of

2880
02:17:30,058 --> 02:17:32,459
um you could say personal protectories

2881
02:17:32,459 --> 02:17:34,799
were kind of shape there where you where

2882
02:17:34,799 --> 02:17:36,898
you already come from so it's a form of

2883
02:17:36,898 --> 02:17:39,359
patrimonial capitalism where it matters

2884
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:43,500
more uh who your parents are than what

2885
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:46,500
you do in terms of uh I choose this

2886
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:48,240
profession or that profession I work

2887
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:50,820
with choose to work hard etc etc

2888
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:52,920
and that means that

2889
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:53,478
um

2890
02:17:53,478 --> 02:17:59,040
an increasing uh part of of of wealth

2891
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:03,478
is not based on on income but it's based

2892
02:18:03,478 --> 02:18:06,718
on other sources of return on assets so

2893
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:08,519
you see that a lot of

2894
02:18:08,519 --> 02:18:10,379
a lot of groups that when you talk about

2895
02:18:10,379 --> 02:18:12,718
the one percent of the zero point one

2896
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:15,000
percent their income is not

2897
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,820
the remuneration of labor but holding

2898
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:22,260
shares uh bonds etc etc

2899
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:26,160
um so this kind of kind of explains why

2900
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:30,240
people that depends on an income from

2901
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:34,859
labor if there's no real wage increases

2902
02:18:34,859 --> 02:18:37,558
well you lose out on people that are

2903
02:18:37,558 --> 02:18:39,660
basically representing Capital that are

2904
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:41,840
shareholders and that kind of runs away

2905
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:44,398
and this kind of the research by by

2906
02:18:44,398 --> 02:18:46,799
picture looking at to the share of the

2907
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:50,040
0.1 so not the one percent but the 0.1

2908
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:51,058
percent

2909
02:18:51,058 --> 02:18:53,340
uh in the United States Britain Canada

2910
02:18:53,340 --> 02:18:54,840
and Australia

2911
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:58,260
we're back in in the U.S at

2912
02:18:58,260 --> 02:19:01,939
um the 0.1 owning seven percent of

2913
02:19:01,939 --> 02:19:06,058
income right so 0.1 owns seven percent

2914
02:19:06,058 --> 02:19:09,058
of all income in in the US

2915
02:19:09,058 --> 02:19:11,939
so it's just just try to imagine what

2916
02:19:11,939 --> 02:19:15,120
that means so and it's it's and every

2917
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:18,179
time you see uh economic growth and if

2918
02:19:18,179 --> 02:19:19,920
it's not automatic automatically

2919
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:22,200
translated into an increase in wages

2920
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:24,420
which is obviously a whole bargaining

2921
02:19:24,420 --> 02:19:27,058
process you see that the return on

2922
02:19:27,058 --> 02:19:29,760
Capital increases and but it runs away

2923
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:32,160
from real income

2924
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:34,320
um and I think that will be the main

2925
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:36,840
discussion I think in the post-war era

2926
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:39,240
what you had for instance the US is

2927
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:42,179
extremely progressive taxation the

2928
02:19:42,179 --> 02:19:44,398
higher incomes were was taxation up to

2929
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:47,519
70 it was considered normal

2930
02:19:47,519 --> 02:19:50,160
what you see now in in multiple

2931
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:52,140
presidencies for instance in the US and

2932
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:54,600
that has been relaxed there are now

2933
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:57,720
counter Tendencies I would say corporate

2934
02:19:57,720 --> 02:19:59,820
taxation there's a whole debate about

2935
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:02,580
that to what extent uh we need to kind

2936
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:05,100
of increase that or standardize that it

2937
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:07,880
is a kind of multi-level chess game

2938
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:10,740
uh which will be hard to realize but at

2939
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:12,840
least some things are going on that so I

2940
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:16,740
think yeah at the top end I think I mean

2941
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:19,560
if all goes normal there's no social

2942
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:21,899
upheaval I think the strength will just

2943
02:20:21,899 --> 02:20:23,820
continue and the question is to what

2944
02:20:23,820 --> 02:20:27,300
extent to when is this socially feasible

2945
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:29,040
to keep things together or will it

2946
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:30,899
really pull apart and political and

2947
02:20:30,899 --> 02:20:32,880
other kind of terms when you think about

2948
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:35,340
cities and then as the final point it

2949
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:37,620
means that this function of cities is

2950
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:39,840
becoming uh transformed as well and

2951
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:41,280
maybe this links a little bit to what

2952
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:43,080
Brett Christopher was talking about last

2953
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:45,899
week is that cities become

2954
02:20:45,899 --> 02:20:50,280
basically safety deposit boxes for those

2955
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:52,800
people that rely on wealth uh you can

2956
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:55,319
think about absent renterism in London

2957
02:20:55,319 --> 02:20:57,060
there's all kinds of neighborhoods that

2958
02:20:57,060 --> 02:20:59,819
are owned for instance by people from uh

2959
02:20:59,819 --> 02:21:02,640
the Arab Persian Gulf that don't live in

2960
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:05,939
London but just yeah and they don't even

2961
02:21:05,939 --> 02:21:07,979
bother to rent out parts of

2962
02:21:07,979 --> 02:21:10,319
Knightsbridge or Chelsea because they

2963
02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:12,000
don't care because they're the value of

2964
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,460
these properties just increases so much

2965
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:15,479
that

2966
02:21:15,479 --> 02:21:17,819
it's irrelevant whether you rent it out

2967
02:21:17,819 --> 02:21:21,000
another example is shell companies in

2968
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:24,319
Manhattan the Time Warner Center

2969
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:27,479
on average 30 million per Apartments I

2970
02:21:27,479 --> 02:21:29,520
think 80 percent of this case is bought

2971
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:31,740
by shell companies which is basically

2972
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:33,780
trusts within a trust within the trust

2973
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:35,939
or whatever so it's somewhere in the

2974
02:21:35,939 --> 02:21:38,160
Cayman Islands or Bermuda trust that

2975
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:40,920
boys these uh properties but you never

2976
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:43,800
really know who's behind these shell

2977
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:46,560
companies so it's a way to uh for which

2978
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:48,660
individuals and corporations to buy into

2979
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:52,380
the same profit property

2980
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:55,620
to maintain the value of those assets to

2981
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:58,979
store their wealth in places

2982
02:21:58,979 --> 02:22:03,660
and yeah to end on the final point it

2983
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:06,720
means that the function of cities is

2984
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:08,520
being transformed as

2985
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:11,280
yeah as holders of value

2986
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:14,640
uh primarily and according to Sasuke

2987
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,640
assassin and the death I conclude

2988
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:19,740
there's a real danger that a process of

2989
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:21,720
deurbanization

2990
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:24,899
is taking place in these leading world

2991
02:22:24,899 --> 02:22:27,780
and Global cities and the case of

2992
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:29,939
abstinent terrorism is a good one

2993
02:22:29,939 --> 02:22:32,580
there's absolutely no life nobody is

2994
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:34,439
living there it's a kind of pure

2995
02:22:34,439 --> 02:22:37,620
financial asset or it's an empty Tower

2996
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:40,100
block where nobody lives

2997
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:42,600
uh and it seems to be a very big

2998
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:44,100
contradiction because when you think

2999
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:44,780
about

3000
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:47,880
bustling bustling world and Global

3001
02:22:47,880 --> 02:22:51,120
cities with a lot of innovation and

3002
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:53,220
diversity etc etc

3003
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:55,380
these are empty shells

3004
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:58,140
there to store the value and the wealth

3005
02:22:58,140 --> 02:23:00,840
of a very very very very very very rich

3006
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:04,740
people and I think it's a huge issue

3007
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:06,899
that we should reflect on

3008
02:23:06,899 --> 02:23:10,370
okay thank you

3009
02:23:10,370 --> 02:23:11,540
[Music]

3010
02:23:11,540 --> 02:23:15,359
thank you uh I hope it was not too

3011
02:23:15,359 --> 02:23:17,460
depressing

3012
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:20,100
um or maybe it that it is depressing and

3013
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:23,100
that we do something about it

3014
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,220
um



# 4 Urban segregation: patterns and causes
1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,420
foreign

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,969
[Music]

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,399
I see some people with a laptop would

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,980
you mind to check whether the webcast is

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,680
working put your link on the link of the

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,940
link of the live stream

7
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,100
um I think it should be

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,850
it should be working I think

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,009
[Music]

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
um

11
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:26,280
because I think that uh some of you

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,259
might know me

13
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,740
and many others might not know me

14
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,880
I am experiments and I will teach this

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,000
class and the next one in urban

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,360
geography Urban social geography

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,579
and I consider myself to be an urban

18
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,159
social person that's a good a good kid I

19
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,820
think

20
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,759
and most of my research has dealt with

21
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,799
migration

22
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,799
newcomers in the city

23
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,500
segregation whiteness

24
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,100
and I've done a PhD with case studies in

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,740
kilometers and in South Africa about 70

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,680
years in Cape Town to study how white

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,220
middle class people moved to the city

28
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,260
and what kind of people they get to meet

29
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,020
uh in in the city

30
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,800
Etc

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,360
um so I've done some work on the

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,220
geographies of encounter the geographies

33
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,860
of migration

34
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,959
um and this year I have decided to work

35
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,720
less at the University and to spend more

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,420
time with my kids and more time on my

37
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,900
bike I like to cycle

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,640
um and so it means that I have reduced

39
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,099
my workload at the University and I

40
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,060
still have a 50 teaching assignment

41
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,640
um I teach social geography in the first

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,239
year Bachelor of geography I teach some

43
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,280
classes in urban geography I also take

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,819
the students on a field trip to Estonia

45
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,220
and this will be the geographers this

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,680
year and I've also done that for the

47
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,160
master in urban studies students and

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,200
two years ago was the last time I think

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,340
we did that

50
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,280
and I'm teaching a course on the city

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,099
and migration that's a title at the

52
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,720
University of Louisville so I have quite

53
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,760
some teaching assignments also

54
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,819
supervising some Master's thesis to PhD

55
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,620
thesis so that's what I'm what I'm doing

56
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,659
um I have written here in my presenters

57
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,540
notes who am I and I'm another white

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,640
male mid-aged middle class man

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,620
that you that you get to see here I

60
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,360
think this issue of positionality is

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,400
also an important one especially in the

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,560
kind of issues that I will discuss when

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,099
it comes to diversity when it comes to

64
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,140
migration what are my experiences in the

65
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,799
city

66
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,840
and so I think that's also something

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,299
important to point at and something that

68
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,860
we could discuss

69
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,879
um also

70
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,739
further in the semester like whether

71
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,459
this is something important or or not to

72
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,200
but there will be not so much time for

73
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,360
discussion today and there will be time

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,260
for discussion in the seminars and that

75
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,060
will come soon and there will also be

76
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,980
time for discussion on the field trips

77
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm going to run through two field trips

78
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,699
for the students this is for the four

79
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,740
cities and the master of urban studies

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,699
students so not for all the other ones

81
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,340
and but we have one Excursion to Antwerp

82
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,100
and one Excursion to Shell next week

83
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,160
that I'm going to run and so I wanted to

84
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,400
share some practicalities and I don't

85
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,139
like the fact that I am somehow bound to

86
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,600
my laptop but this is for the live

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,240
stream and so it's I hope that it's that

88
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,000
it's uh is working now

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,780
um

90
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,380
but so first of all next week Tuesday I

91
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,900
think 40 of you have signed up to go to

92
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,060
Antwerp is that correct who will join me

93
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,040
to Antwerp

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,840
yeah

95
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,419
um I will hand out some

96
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,419
Excursion guides and printed them in

97
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,060
color by accident I don't know how happy

98
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,479
the department will be about that if you

99
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,300
get these paper copies in in full colors

100
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,600
so you can take one if you join me yeah

101
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,220
don't take one if you don't join me

102
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,360
because then I will not have enough

103
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,100
copies for everyone

104
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,800
and what is important and that's

105
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,460
something else that I want to hand out

106
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,580
I'm living in Antwerp and so I will meet

107
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,240
you in uh enter a railway station

108
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,759
um

109
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,600
to be in my wallet

110
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,780
who is joining to enter and is familiar

111
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,740
with this

112
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,220
Rail Pass OR Go pass

113
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,419
no one

114
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,699
yeah some people

115
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,940
um so I will give this uh to you and I

116
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,520
would like you for all the people that

117
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,560
join we need one line okay so it says

118
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,139
um this isn't French you can also fill

119
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,539
it in in Dutch or in English the day

120
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,320
Tuesday the date in the Belgian system

121
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,100
with day month year then the place for

122
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,440
American beef that will be Brussels and

123
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,880
then enter

124
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,160
yeah and you need lines for everyone

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,000
it's a bit complicated as

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,120
um you have tickets for those under 26

127
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,419
and other tickets for those over 26 a

128
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,699
bit more expensive

129
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,960
so I will give them to you

130
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,699
thank you

131
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
so good

132
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,080
so it's important that you meet on time

133
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,860
20 to 8 next week Tuesday we are leaving

134
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,639
rather early

135
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,440
um with a train that will have as a

136
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,800
destination

137
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,780
which is a small station to the north of

138
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,120
Antwerp but it's important that you get

139
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,759
off at Antwerpen Central

140
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,440
yeah so the group will meet 740 you take

141
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,240
you make sure that you get on the train

142
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,240
752

143
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,479
Elena and Louisa will make sure together

144
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,940
with all of you that you have a line for

145
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,780
each student you get on the train and it

146
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,419
will be platform five I guess if you're

147
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,660
late you pay for your own tickets and so

148
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,819
use let's use that as an incentive I

149
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,620
will not reimburse anyone who leaves

150
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,960
late you should travel with the group

151
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,979
and then you all arrive at the same time

152
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:19,740
according to the schedule at 8 35 and I

153
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,440
will meet you on the platform

154
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,199
yeah so that's what we do we will go

155
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,780
cycling I hope that everyone was aware

156
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,979
of that

157
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,440
it will it is November it will be cold

158
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,200
it will be wet so make sure that you

159
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,599
bring some gloves and some rain gear

160
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,659
because it might um it might be called

161
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,360
bring the Excursion guides especially

162
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,760
now that it has been printed in full

163
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,620
color because you will use that quite a

164
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,459
bit

165
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,560
and we are going to discuss basically

166
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,899
the topics of the this class and next

167
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,000
class so we will discuss segregation and

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
social mix in the field in Android

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,880
we will get to cycle about 25 kilometers

170
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,940
that's quite a bit

171
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,000
um but it has worked out every year

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,580
nicely so I trust that it will be the

173
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,320
same

174
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,959
um wear a mouth mask on the train

175
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,940
yeah I don't know what the regulations

176
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,580
will say how how we need to get around

177
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,040
in Antwerp we are quite a big group I

178
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,279
might split you up a couple of times

179
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,580
um bring a lunch or buy one in

180
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,440
Enterprises also I will give you an hour

181
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,839
to to have a lunch but we will be in

182
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,640
quite a fancy part of time so it might

183
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,440
be more complicated to find a cheap

184
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,800
place there but not impossible

185
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,720
yeah so

186
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,300
you will complete these rail passes and

187
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,820
go passes and then you will when you

188
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,560
arrive in anthrope you will give these

189
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,899
two to me

190
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,820
next week Friday I will take you to um

191
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,740
or some of you who will join me to

192
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,779
Charlotte

193
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,140
okay so a similar amount of people and

194
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,779
we will meet in the Brussels railway

195
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,839
station Central so that's important 10

196
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,720
minutes later but still quite early at

197
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,440
10 to 8. in order to be on the train at

198
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,180
seven past eight

199
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,300
yeah again the same system that say I

200
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,760
will be responsible for the rail passes

201
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,160
and the go passes if you're late you

202
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,660
will need to get in touch with a fellow

203
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,459
student to know where we are I'm not

204
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,839
going to wait for you at the train

205
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,779
station in but also you need to pay your

206
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,120
own ticket yeah

207
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,700
um we're going to hike first through the

208
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,820
city but we will also climb some of

209
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,480
these uh at least one Ash Heap in French

210
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,959
so this is a small mountain of yeah

211
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,959
like leftovers from the coal mining it

212
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,940
is quite steep it can be wet so you

213
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,339
should also have some good shoes that

214
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,100
allow you to to do that

215
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,800
bring a pen and paper and I will bring

216
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,899
you a similar kind of Excursion guide

217
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,019
probably in black and white

218
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,660
um for the shadow Excursion

219
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,000
and you can again bring a lunch or buy

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
one in Charlotte

221
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,380
do we have any practical questions about

222
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,100
these trips

223
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,700
that's a good question

224
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,740
um I think in Shelby I will end around

225
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,260
five meaning you can get back to

226
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,440
Brussels around six but I have a habit

227
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,600
to anti or to give you the possibility

228
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,339
either to get on a train back to

229
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,100
Brussels but I also suggest you to walk

230
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,459
back to Charlotte train station

231
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,440
and but if you want you can be back in

232
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,120
Brussels at six

233
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,300
um from Antwerp we will end at six the

234
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,980
very latest because that's the moment

235
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,440
when I need to give back the bikes to

236
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,839
the bike rental agency and so that means

237
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,279
that you should be able to be back in

238
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,120
Brussels at seven

239
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,019
some other practical questions

240
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,339
no and I'm looking yeah

241
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,140
no you will get a helmet you will get a

242
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,260
look

243
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,180
um if you're very eager to take your own

244
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,519
bike to Anthem it's you can do that on

245
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,079
the train and it's a bit of a hassle but

246
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,060
you will get a nice rental bike you will

247
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,800
get a helmet if you want and you will

248
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
get

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,240
um a lock for the bike as well

250
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,060
foreign

251
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,980
so I will see you next week I will see

252
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,240
40 of you next week Tuesday in uh in

253
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,060
Antwerp Central Railway Station

254
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,260
um I'm looking forward to that

255
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,420
so these are the practicalities about

256
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,399
the excursions I'm glad that I was able

257
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
to share that personally rather than

258
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,339
just another message in the canvas

259
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,500
um today you're not in session one

260
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,959
you're in session four you had an

261
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,139
introductory class you had two classes

262
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,899
on road City formation and polarization

263
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,600
in world global cities and basically

264
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,959
today we will continue a bit on the

265
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,420
theme of class three and I will we will

266
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,120
discuss segregation we will discuss

267
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,820
patterns of segregation and we will just

268
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,940
discuss causes of segregation and next

269
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,160
week I will discuss effects or

270
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,920
Consequences of sick yeah so these are

271
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,800
two classes that fit very well together

272
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,860
and there is a clear theme for each of

273
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,839
them patterns causes of segregation

274
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,540
today affects consequences of

275
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,440
segregation next week

276
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,160
I assume that all of you have read these

277
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,360
two texts

278
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,940
and have you maybe we can I can also

279
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,579
have a look who who has read these two

280
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,320
texts

281
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,079
you can be proud about it who has not

282
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,839
been able to read these two texts you

283
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,540
can also be proud about that okay so I

284
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,820
see that more people have not read it

285
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,000
not read them rather than read them

286
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,100
um for the discussion seminar I think

287
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,040
it's important that we have

288
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,800
like a shared knowledge and these two

289
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,720
texts for this week and the two texts

290
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,519
for next week will be the shared

291
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,500
knowledge together with what is being

292
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,079
shared in the class so I hope that all

293
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,880
of you will be able to read these two

294
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,060
texts and the two for next week by the

295
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,740
time we have the discussions

296
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,279
um

297
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,779
okay

298
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,040
today

299
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,339
I have basically three topics I will

300
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,500
discuss first these classical models of

301
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,440
urban form in the text by pachone which

302
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,240
was a textbook chapter there was a

303
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,579
reference to Burgess I'm going to talk

304
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,199
about Hoyt I'm going to talk about

305
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,959
Harrison Allman some classical models of

306
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,240
urban form that have been generated by

307
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,519
Chicago School Scholars in the beginning

308
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,220
of the 20th century

309
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,260
then secondly I'm going to discuss

310
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,380
patterns of segregation meaning that we

311
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,000
will discuss like how to measure

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,740
segregation and

313
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,440
how you can look at segregation from

314
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,260
different angles and then at the end of

315
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,600
the class I will discuss some causes of

316
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
segregation why is it that people lit

317
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,399
that poor and rich people live in

318
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,680
different neighborhoods of the city why

319
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,019
is it that you can find white people in

320
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,660
one part of town and people of like

321
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,540
African origin in another part of town

322
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,380
Etc

323
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,820
so this is the topic list for today and

324
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm going to start with this classic

325
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,820
Land Use model by Burgess

326
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,980
so those of you who have read the

327
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,540
textbook chapter by pachome have been

328
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,600
reading about the burgers he was writing

329
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,440
from Chicago

330
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,339
1925. I think that's important I will

331
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,199
do the live stream like this I think

332
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,820
that might also still work is everyone

333
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,399
able to hear me at the back here yeah

334
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,860
okay so that's that's going around the

335
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,680
world so what was Burgers doing he was

336
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,199
trying to understand

337
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,639
how cities

338
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,560
were looking like and what kind of

339
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,899
groups groups of people you could find

340
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,899
in different parts of the city

341
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,120
they were stating that basically you had

342
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,199
five

343
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,480
concentric rings

344
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,639
in the Heart of the City there was the

345
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,500
loop

346
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,240
um the loop I will I will discuss that

347
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,519
later it's a term from Chicago basically

348
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,260
the central business district

349
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,079
yeah around that you have the zone of

350
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,899
transition that's how you found it then

351
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,120
around in the third zone of working

352
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,040
working methods the residential Zone

353
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,920
suburban and another uh residential Zone

354
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,980
with reaching out the commuters so five

355
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,019
rings around the city

356
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,600
and why was it that you have these five

357
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,639
rings well

358
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,940
because different functions in the city

359
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,000
in different groups of people were able

360
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,040
to pay different rents

361
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,980
so the theory was that in the center of

362
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,160
the city the central business district

363
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
you found

364
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,520
for example the headquarters of an

365
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,359
office

366
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,419
because they were able to pay the higher

367
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,299
rents that you had so close to the city

368
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,740
center

369
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,500
and further away from the city

370
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,620
was the theory you would find for

371
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,780
example

372
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,640
Suburban plots

373
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,980
um what's very intense because these

374
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,020
people were able to spend to pay less

375
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,480
rents

376
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,880
for their part of

377
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,380
so this is really Theory

378
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,160
um was basically underlying this model

379
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,919
of concentric things

380
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,980
yeah this term model can be a little bit

381
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,179
confusing

382
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,980
and because it could give you the

383
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,840
impression that this is an ideal type

384
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,660
like this is how it sit all through yeah

385
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,179
but Burgers was trying to do but

386
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,640
basically to

387
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,679
simplify reality and to understand how

388
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,140
cities were not necessarily how they

389
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,320
opened it how our cities and we try to

390
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,860
simplify it and that's how a simplified

391
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,700
version of Chicago of a western City

392
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,600
looks like

393
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,020
I told you already written in 1925

394
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,020
yeah that's very important why because

395
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,840
we are at a moment in time this is the

396
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,320
population of Chicago from 1840 to 2014

397
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,980
we are at a moment in time 1925 when

398
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,500
this population of Chicago has been

399
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,660
growing through an exponential growth

400
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,940
for many many years

401
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,440
yeah and that also explains why

402
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,080
Burgess was making a model of the growth

403
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,820
of the system

404
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,880
yeah it's not a model of any City it's

405
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,100
the model of a growing city and he tries

406
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,919
to understand how this growth of a City

407
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,299
Works

408
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,020
both in terms of a growing population

409
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,940
but also

410
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,520
a city that is characterized by an

411
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,080
expanding area that is built the

412
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,460
environment

413
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,640
is growing and so it's a level of the

414
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,559
growth of the city

415
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,539
and writing from Chicago in 1925 well

416
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,820
this is a very particular growing city

417
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,700
this is a city of immigration where a

418
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,020
lot of immigrants

419
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,179
are from all over the world but from

420
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,080
Europe in particularly initially arrived

421
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,000
and where they settle

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,360
and where you see that in

423
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,020
1900 you had less than 2 million people

424
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,960
and uh you need to go only 10 15 years

425
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,780
later to find another amazing into added

426
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,780
to the population and so this is a fast

427
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,020
growing City

428
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,299
um both in terms of population and in

429
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,940
terms of the area that is built up

430
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,400
that's also expanding that's also true

431
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,080
um it's also a city that is

432
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,940
characterized by heterogeneous

433
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,640
population so what you see here is the

434
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,160
result of a survey

435
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,039
going from house to house knocking on

436
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,720
people's door and then checking whether

437
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,200
there is someone English speaking in

438
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,539
White Irish in green German in purple

439
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:48,539
Dutch in dark purple Russian in red Etc

440
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,059
and so you see that the city was

441
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,760
characterized by a heterogeneous organic

442
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,220
all these people coming from different

443
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,460
countries of origin arriving in Chicago

444
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,980
at that time okay so it's a particular

445
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,460
City that Burgers is writing from and

446
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,740
I'm saying that because I want to argue

447
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,700
that this theory that Virgos made up and

448
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,039
which he thought was Universal for

449
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,760
growing cities was in in fact

450
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,880
a theory that was mostly applicable to

451
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,179
Chicago itself yeah and so here you see

452
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,220
a couple of assumptions which are also

453
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,360
mentioned

454
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,940
uh in the in the text that you've read

455
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,679
or that you're going to read

456
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,140
the assumptions and principles that were

457
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,120
underlying this theory of the model of

458
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,120
um the growing city of the growth so you

459
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,179
see that the assumption is that there is

460
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,120
this cultural and social approach

461
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,340
of the population

462
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,799
you could also think of other cities

463
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,559
yeah in countries which are less smart

464
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,360
by this kind of diversity

465
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,980
and the second assumption is that there

466
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,440
is a commercial industrial base to the

467
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,299
economy of the city

468
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,640
could you think of other

469
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,100
basis to the economy of the city

470
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,500
that kind of other places could you have

471
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,720
rather than commercial that's true

472
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,380
tourism yeah if you go to a city that is

473
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,120
marked by two resistance for example

474
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,260
each

475
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,200
distribute could be of any importance

476
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,460
please

477
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,620
yeah while in a commercial industrial

478
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,080
city it's a meteorological But Central

479
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,440
Business districts the center office

480
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,520
during the city is dominated by a

481
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,500
touristic cities well then you would get

482
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,520
different

483
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,020
I know also saw other characters

484
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,799
based yeah then you would hit the

485
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,320
Heritage I could also Imagine like

486
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,500
cities that draw a lot of pilgrims a

487
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,260
religious basis to the city of Temple or

488
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,620
a church would be Central places Etc so

489
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,320
you can think of other kinds of cities

490
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,140
yeah and then the the idea of burgers

491
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,100
would be that this model of urban growth

492
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,860
private ownership of property economic

493
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,020
competition for space you can imagine

494
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,340
other cities

495
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,740
in the Soviet Union for example plan the

496
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,520
economy different kind of systems

497
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,220
um for expanding area and population of

498
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,400
the city many cities in in Europe are

499
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,039
nowadays marked by shrinkage

500
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,280
yeah in Eastern Germany for example

501
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,980
um Genova in Italy city that has been

502
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,020
marked by shrinkage for a very long time

503
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,940
Detroit

504
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,919
a city in North America

505
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,179
that has gone through a similar

506
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,860
fifth essential transport is equally

507
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,159
easy easy rapid and key in every

508
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,020
direction within the city

509
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,480
it's hard to imagine how that would ever

510
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,520
be possible because you will always have

511
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,980
transport infrastructure that will allow

512
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,780
you to move from one end of the city

513
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,659
much more quickly to another end than to

514
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,460
another part of the city

515
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,940
okay number five the city center is the

516
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,280
main Center for employment and therefore

517
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,659
most credible

518
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,360
people also think to many other kinds of

519
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,700
city where for example the airport is an

520
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,460
important top and you have a big

521
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,760
um big development around this Airport

522
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,799
so these things are more attractive

523
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,500
because of differences in terrain I told

524
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,659
you I did my PhD on Cape Town you've got

525
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,520
the Atlantic Ocean you've got Table

526
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,799
Mountain you can imagine that these

527
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,539
differences in terrain are very

528
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,360
important to understand how this city is

529
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,039
owned

530
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,559
you have no concentrations of heavy

531
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,700
industry

532
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,340
yeah and you have no historic survival

533
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,860
of an earlier land use pattern in any

534
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,940
District

535
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,840
there is no Heritage do you have a 19th

536
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,000
century housing or a medieval argument

537
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,179
City yeah and so

538
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,580
um verbis himself already acknowledged

539
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,400
that it hardly needs to be added and I'm

540
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,820
quoting this that neither Chicago nor

541
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,299
any other City fits perfectly into this

542
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,700
ideal ski

543
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,340
complications in Chicago are introduced

544
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,520
by the lakefront the lake in Chicago

545
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,520
so there is a difference

546
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,419
the Chicago River another difference in

547
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,419
Korea railroad lines which mean that

548
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,520
which major transport is not equally

549
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,760
easy rapidly cheap in every direction

550
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,100
and historical factors in the location

551
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,860
of industry and which might mean that

552
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,200
you have concentrations of heavy

553
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,340
industry in some parts

554
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,520
um Etc

555
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,740
and so you see the acknowledgment that

556
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,600
well I'm trying to

557
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,740
formulate a universal model of urban

558
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,120
growth but well underlying my theory are

559
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,980
a lot of assumptions and principles

560
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,700
which mean that basically I'm writing

561
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,679
uh

562
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,960
I'm writing up a model of a specific

563
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,480
City in Chicago and basically my model

564
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,080
was composed for Chicago doesn't even

565
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,760
hold for Chicago itself because there

566
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,960
are many complicated factors okay

567
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,380
um I will I will discuss this further in

568
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,539
a bit like and we

569
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,820
in in urban studies we have been going

570
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,740
through a moment where we

571
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,840
um I started to realize well many of our

572
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,539
theories are provincial when we write

573
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,520
about gentrification and we make a

574
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,159
theory of gentrification then if we make

575
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,100
a case on Brussels then we write a very

576
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,039
Western kind of perspective

577
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,039
gentrification so it's necessary to

578
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,020
de-provincialize our theories I find it

579
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,000
interesting that already 100 years ago

580
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,179
there was this awareness that well me

581
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,220
burgers I'm writing from Chicago and

582
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,380
this is important to to understand

583
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,320
um

584
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,140
so how did this model look like I will

585
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,039
run through this Central Central most

586
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,400
Central concentric ring is the group you

587
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,900
have a wider group

588
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,640
and if you've ever been to Chicago

589
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,760
you've got this Metro lines that all

590
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,279
converge in the city and where basically

591
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,919
this whole Metro is making a loop and

592
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,919
then taking back the line from where

593
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,740
it's going so you have this elevated

594
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,840
metal track

595
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,659
but in a loop in the shape of a loop and

596
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,100
so that's why the essential business

597
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,840
that speak of Chicago is called

598
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,820
so this is the place where you have

599
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,020
shopping

600
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,799
uh where you have offices or you have

601
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,840
headquarters of companies where you

602
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,140
expect to find theaters

603
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,840
um Etc because these are the functions

604
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,380
that are able to pay the highest rent

605
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,779
the highest price for the central

606
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,880
voltage why do they want to be in the

607
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,919
central location well these are all

608
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,860
functions that need to draw

609
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,360
um office workers Shoppers theater goers

610
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,419
from all corners of the city and so for

611
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,940
them it is important to be in the

612
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,419
central location that is easy to reach

613
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,419
from everywhere in this and so they want

614
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:43,860
to be in

615
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,320
the loop

616
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,240
and Chicago 1925 a picture the video of

617
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,100
ID busy streets the first skyscrapers of

618
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,340
the world in the city earlier than New

619
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,980
York and so you have basically the first

620
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,440
city where you have this

621
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,460
um how to say that like this classical

622
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,960
uh Central Business districts from a

623
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,480
North American Town Syria it's all

624
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,400
skyscrapers

625
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,980
so Zone one the Central Business this

626
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,240
around this you have

627
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,919
The Zone in transition the zone of Truth

628
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,539
basically what you find there is factors

629
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,460
why do these factories want to be

630
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,120
located there they also rely on labor

631
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,539
that needs to come in by a trend by

632
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:40,740
Metro

633
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,620
Etc so they also want to be in a central

634
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,960
location that allows them to bring in

635
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,320
workers from all corners but they are

636
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,140
not able to pay these high prices for

637
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,059
lands but these functions on the

638
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,460
previous slides were able to offer them

639
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,480
and some of you find a second ring in

640
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,539
which you have these factors

641
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,679
not only factories you also find

642
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,880
neighborhoods there

643
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,760
yeah who wants to live close to these

644
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,120
factories nobody this is very polluted

645
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,700
this is very dirty these are very bad

646
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,179
living circumstances so who ends up here

647
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,899
the first generation of immigrants from

648
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,659
different countries of origin yeah and

649
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,460
as soon as these people are able to

650
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,779
perform a move to a better part of town

651
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,240
then they will do so

652
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,100
they have to do some of these names that

653
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,080
you find on these pictures

654
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,559
little hell tells quite a bit

655
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,080
but also the fact that for example here

656
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,440
we have Little Sicily so this is a part

657
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,919
of town where these Sicilians arrive but

658
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,740
that was formerly little Sweden

659
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,000
yeah so you see how one group of

660
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,880
newcomers moves out and is Then followed

661
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,820
by a new group of people from another

662
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,100
country of origin that was what Burgess

663
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,299
was noticing in 1925. and so this is the

664
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:16,320
part of the Chicago close to the central

665
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,559
business District close to the loop

666
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,320
in the middle of all these factories

667
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,860
where people who just landed off the

668
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,940
boat

669
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,279
from Europe arrived and so you have

670
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,779
subsequent

671
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,299
groups ethnicities of newcomers who

672
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,580
arrive

673
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,880
people who have been able to climb the

674
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,419
social leather they will move out of

675
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:45,299
these areas and they are able to afford

676
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,240
a better home

677
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,740
further away from these factories and

678
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,440
they are also able to afford the commute

679
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,200
between home and the world so there's

680
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,520
also a price

681
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,940
to be paid for this so the purpose is

682
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,620
writing there about the zone of

683
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,580
independent working man's hopes

684
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,700
and in his vocabulary which is the

685
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,520
respectable working class is working

686
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,520
it's living in the episode

687
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,700
and so I found it interesting that

688
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,720
um

689
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,080
like here six miles north west of the

690
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,279
loop

691
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,799
West yeah so we are moving in that

692
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,140
direction about 10 kilometers out of the

693
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,320
loop you also have an area of Chicago at

694
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,520
that time where you had quite some

695
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,580
belgians living yeah and Burgess was

696
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,220
also writing about the belgians many of

697
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,260
them were janitors so they also have

698
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,740
like a specific profession uh that many

699
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,320
of them were known

700
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,200
and they also had a clip so you see here

701
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,260
1921 all belgians are equal

702
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:58,140
oh the um to build a club for belgians

703
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,380
celebrating Belgium space and Belgian

704
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,299
Traditions you have the Saint John

705
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:06,320
bergman's Church Cynthia

706
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,179
in Chicago and so up to today you can

707
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:12,419
visit this neighborhood that was marked

708
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,519
by belgians and in the past

709
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,799
yeah but you also had neighborhoods

710
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,320
where you had many Germans or many

711
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,380
Russians or many Italians who had been

712
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,539
able to plan this social leather and who

713
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:28,080
had been able to out with further away

714
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,740
from this

715
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,580
I've also shown you this map of this

716
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,380
survey going door to door there was a

717
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,799
lot of heterogeneity even in streets but

718
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,720
some neighborhoods were also marked by

719
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,140
this ethnic groups

720
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,140
and then as you go further away from the

721
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,240
loop you get to more Suburban less dense

722
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,460
developments and here you see the

723
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,640
neighborhood of Mount prospects about 25

724
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,240
miles north west from the loop so we are

725
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,059
moving about 40 kilometers out of the

726
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:10,139
route now 30 to 60 Minutes commute to

727
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,719
the loop by train and so the moment that

728
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,179
these trains are being trained lines are

729
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,280
being built you see this kind of

730
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,040
suburban developments and then you see

731
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,359
and

732
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,659
find prospects 1917

733
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:27,899
this is a cape to commemorate the 50th

734
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,699
anniversary

735
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,980
but you also see who is living there

736
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,099
long twist Swedish families who have

737
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,379
arrived quite early and will be able to

738
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,080
find this social media that will arrived

739
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,359
a little Sweden but then we moved to the

740
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:46,020
Zone respectable working men's homes has

741
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,139
very discovered who have been able to as

742
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,179
they climbed the social level we have

743
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,440
also been able to

744
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,619
to this Suburban developments in between

745
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,399
four part

746
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
IES

747
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,220
I'm sorry further further red

748
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,060
part of it is becoming more expensive

749
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,619
yeah but you need to you need to see it

750
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:20,220
uh rent for like you need to pay dollars

751
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,900
per square meter

752
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,900
and so closer you get

753
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,119
to the city center the 10 service

754
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,859
development

755
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,320
and so for that reason it's not about

756
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,540
life what what you can afford but it's

757
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,060
how much you are willing to pay per

758
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,500
second

759
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,900
yeah and so these developments closer to

760
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,480
the sensor are much more dense

761
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,280
yeah so that explains why this picture

762
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,599
and curve is still going down

763
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,660
Burgers so the concentric zone model

764
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,540
and and a theory that has

765
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,200
is still being being being used but even

766
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,359
today if you read about newcomers and

767
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,480
cities and neighborhoods of arrival and

768
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,500
people still refer to Ferguson

769
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,540
conceptualized his arrival of newcomers

770
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,660
in Chicago and the kind of neighborhoods

771
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,960
that they were going through as they

772
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,420
climbed the social touch

773
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,520
yeah

774
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,700
um but you also have other models

775
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,880
um I'm still before the second World War

776
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,920
avoids another researcher who studied

777
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,839
142 American cities

778
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,359
and who stated in the beginning of his

779
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:45,540
paper that so far reaching are the

780
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,960
changes in our population pattern and

781
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,359
social structure that it can well be

782
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,640
asked whether theories of City growth

783
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,460
and structure formulated for the private

784
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,099
enterprise economy of the late 19th and

785
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,920
20th centuries is not referring to

786
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,079
Burgers but it could be will be

787
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,440
applicable in a future society that may

788
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,900
be of a fundamentally different nature

789
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,880
what happens between 1925 and 1939 in

790
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,180
America what kind of changes could be so

791
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,460
important that you that they have an

792
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,460
impact on the model of uh

793
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,619
yeah the depression so this is about

794
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:32,160
crisis a moment of economic crisis

795
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
yes and when you look at

796
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,660
I will go a couple of slides back

797
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,880
when you look at population growth

798
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,320
and in Chicago then you see that this

799
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,339
crisis 1929 the 1930s but this has a

800
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:57,440
clear impact also on the population of

801
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,740
as people are eager to immigrate to a

802
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,660
country in crisis the government is also

803
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,119
more strict on who can come

804
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,160
Etc and so

805
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,460
there is a big economic crisis that also

806
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,020
means that there is less migration

807
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,000
whether it's related to less migration

808
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,859
to the states

809
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,599
there are also other

810
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,220
phenomena

811
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,460
yeah so Boyd was writing himself a new

812
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,740
theory of Simply grade growth may be

813
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,500
necessary to fit the effects of a period

814
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,260
when cities grow more slowly

815
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,660
yeah that's what I told you already but

816
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,359
also when Automobiles and airplanes

817
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,480
remove dependency on fixed rails

818
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,440
the car becomes much more important if

819
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,980
you can imagine that a City built for

820
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,380
car drivers looks quite different from a

821
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,780
city that is built for people who take a

822
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,420
tram or a Metro or a train

823
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,700
and he also adds that what is also

824
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,320
different is that there's more

825
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,359
government control and Taxation for

826
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,760
fighting costs for the benefit of the

827
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,099
poor this is a graph that tells you

828
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,480
something about

829
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,260
taxation of the top internal rates in

830
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,820
the states and so you see that this has

831
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,460
been going through quite some changes

832
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,400
yeah and then as described as

833
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,619
when America was hit by crisis that

834
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,720
there was an urge to to have more

835
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,540
effects more income tax to this highest

836
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,820
now what that means is that government

837
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,119
can also intervene more in-house in

838
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,920
infrastructure

839
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,500
etc etc

840
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,540
um so a couple of changes that these

841
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,520
cities have been going through and so

842
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,760
art is saying well these models made for

843
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,240
cities of a particular kind remember

844
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,480
these assumptions of burgers do not hold

845
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,720
true in the cities that I am studying in

846
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,940
the 1930s it's 140. City speakers we see

847
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,900
a lot of different kind of processes

848
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,960
so voids came up with a sector

849
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,180
a sector theory saying that well you

850
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,440
still have this Central business

851
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,980
district in the city because around this

852
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,200
they do not have a couple of

853
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,380
drinks but you have sectors

854
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,260
yeah and the assumption is that when the

855
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,060
city grows

856
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,900
each of these sectors will grow and so

857
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,859
if you have to the now in this case to

858
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,099
the east

859
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:39,780
sector in which the richest people are

860
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,119
living and the assumption is that when

861
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,400
these group growth or the population of

862
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,040
the city grows that this sector will

863
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,220
also grow to the east

864
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,380
and so you have a couple of different

865
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,339
sectors high class medium

866
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,980
which are also organized by the

867
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,160
transportation

868
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,820
infrastructure and so you would have

869
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,339
industry factories concentrated along

870
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:12,300
rivers canals Rail lines on roads

871
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,280
immediately next to that you would have

872
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,420
low class residential areas just like

873
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,220
burgers assumed

874
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,500
but Burgers assumed that these factories

875
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
and the lowest

876
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,780
low-class areas would be located in a

877
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,780
concentric ring and boy it was saying

878
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,420
well if you look at cities in the 30s in

879
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,060
America and the sector model comes

880
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,339
closer to reality so this is a better

881
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:43,160
way to simplify how cities are looking

882
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,280
um so sectors rather than concentric

883
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,619
Rings what is also important is that

884
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:53,220
there's much more emphasis on Class A

885
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,220
medium class low class high class while

886
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,500
Burgers was often writing from these

887
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,940
ethnic groups Italians Sicilians uh

888
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,240
Germans Russians Swedish people arriving

889
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,260
in the city

890
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,800
um

891
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,079
okay a third model

892
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,260
is the one by Harris alone and this is a

893
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,099
graph

894
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:23,119
or a picture that comes from their paper

895
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,780
we moved on the 1945 and you see that in

896
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,760
their paper they make a reference

897
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,099
already which is concentric so novel by

898
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:35,359
Burgess they refer to the secret Theory

899
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,760
by Boyd and then they come up with their

900
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,980
own model which is called the multiple

901
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,839
nuclear model of a city

902
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,579
um and you see indeed that they have

903
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,400
this kind of jigsaw puzzle that

904
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,440
represents the city for them in which

905
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,480
you still find number one a central

906
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,260
business district and next to it and the

907
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,880
next with the district with wholesale

908
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,520
light manufacturing but you also see a

909
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,220
couple of other notes that are important

910
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,460
to understand the city for example seven

911
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,640
and outlying business

912
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,400
yeah so this is an important difference

913
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,740
between these two models and that one

914
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,560
there's not just one Central business

915
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,660
district which you also have important

916
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,780
business districts in other parts of the

917
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,800
city

918
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,119
for example in London even in in the

919
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,880
history

920
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,980
they have this economic heart

921
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,520
of the city of the city close to Tower

922
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,319
Bridge and you've got a political Heart

923
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,900
of the City close to Westminster epic

924
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,500
but there is a distance between while in

925
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,180
this traditional models you would expect

926
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,940
them to be concentrated and close to

927
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,500
each other in the central business

928
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,180
district

929
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,599
I also refer to Chicago I say there are

930
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,940
a couple of

931
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,060
Industries or universities which are in

932
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,579
very different parts of the city than

933
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,800
this Burgers model

934
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,040
and expected so they refer to area of

935
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,640
heavy industry and posted the

936
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,400
the river and the lake and then also

937
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,819
this University of Chicago to the South

938
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:24,420
which is then again like the hook of uh

939
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,180
like an area in which you find middle

940
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,760
class people University lecturers and

941
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,380
people working

942
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,540
in a part of time where you would not

943
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,099
expect them to and so they also look at

944
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:39,599
these kind of spikes in the big

945
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,420
difference saying that well normally

946
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,579
according to burgers this would always

947
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,280
go down

948
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,520
by the the further you get from the city

949
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,000
center the lower is bitter and curve

950
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,599
would be the lower the price per square

951
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,900
meter that people companies or other

952
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,780
functions are willing to fail but then

953
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,000
Arizona would say well you always find

954
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,280
this kind of local spikes for example

955
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,220
local shopping centers not all the

956
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,200
shopping is happening

957
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,119
the central business district and so

958
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,800
also you can find these local shopping

959
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,000
centers or a satellite City and around

960
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,579
which you find again like is a

961
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:26,760
decreasing can be transfers yeah so a

962
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,460
third model here is an omen where you

963
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,960
have multiple nuclei

964
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,720
more than one Center basically and you

965
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,240
get this kind of jigsaw puzzle to to

966
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,980
simplify an urban form

967
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,700
in this Theory they only consider those

968
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,560
10

969
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,420
or well or in that case in that City

970
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,400
yeah every city will have a different

971
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,099
kind of home but their main argument is

972
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,920
that these models are too simplistic

973
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,560
and not everything is radiating from one

974
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,119
Center but in practice you will always

975
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,440
find

976
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,140
it so that's why reality looks more

977
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,040
complex than in decimals

978
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,200
okay

979
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,319
um

980
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,280
why to go back to Chicago why to go back

981
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,020
to theories that have been written 100

982
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,960
years ago I think it's interesting to

983
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,240
make Urban geographers or people who do

984
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,300
Urban studies who made them think about

985
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,180
the form of a city and who is living

986
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,980
where

987
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,800
and so on the left you have here a map

988
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,480
of Chicago

989
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,420
nowadays and each dot basically

990
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,599
represents one person

991
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,819
lost Maps Detroit automatic Network

992
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:54,180
finds maps for other American cities

993
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,420
like this and so you you see here that

994
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,819
basically the different colors on the

995
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:03,260
map represent different people who

996
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,540
self-identified with different races

997
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,280
slash ethnicities

998
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,780
yeah so and I think you find people

999
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,940
self-identified as the white in the year

1000
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,880
2010 in blue you find people who

1001
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,300
self-identified as black in green people

1002
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,599
who self-identify as Asian and in Orange

1003
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:29,599
people who self-identify as Hispanic

1004
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,240
in the American context uh race slash

1005
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,700
ethnicity corresponds very much with

1006
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,900
clocks

1007
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,140
that's if you would have a map with

1008
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,040
socioeconomic classes then you would

1009
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,720
also find that most of these

1010
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,720
neighborhoods which turn out to be

1011
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,040
thinking

1012
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,980
and you have a majority of

1013
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,240
self-identified as why but this will

1014
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,300
also be the better of any business

1015
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,640
and that the neighborhoods with people

1016
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,280
who self-identified black could be

1017
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,240
underprivileged

1018
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,760
so now my question for you is which of

1019
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,579
these models of urban form the

1020
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:09,839
concentric

1021
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,180
remodel by Burgess

1022
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,640
a sector model by voids for this

1023
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,700
multiple nuclear model can you find on

1024
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,200
the map

1025
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,920
foreign

1026
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,540
models on the map so when you look at

1027
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,380
this

1028
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:36,200
closely what what do you see who sees

1029
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,040
you find this kind of sectors

1030
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,420
yeah

1031
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,300
and in heat I have the metro map of

1032
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,040
Chicago this will be the center of

1033
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,619
business districts you have like pieces

1034
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,000
of pie

1035
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,119
that starts from the central business so

1036
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,060
indeed much of Chicago nowadays

1037
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,220
is still looking like voids would have

1038
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,900
predicted between these different

1039
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,000
sectors

1040
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,200
corresponding with different populations

1041
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,020
groups different socio-economic classes

1042
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,140
low-class high-class medium class to use

1043
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,020
the vocabulary line at Five Points so in

1044
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,339
this you can still find that yeah

1045
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,339
Burgess

1046
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,480
okay so what is representative

1047
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,460
where it is considered to be relevant

1048
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,099
100 years ago we still make maps like

1049
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:49,560
this so for some reason we still find it

1050
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,500
important please

1051
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,920
but when you look at the pattern

1052
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,880
yeah

1053
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,880
pleasure

1054
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,200
uh

1055
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:14,460
okay so indeed it's very hard to see

1056
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,280
concentric sense the ring one because

1057
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,140
there will be very few residents of the

1058
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,640
central business district

1059
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,160
it's also hard to spot concentric Rim 2

1060
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,260
it's also a large response concentric

1061
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,079
ring three but then when you move

1062
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,960
further away from the city center it's

1063
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,079
ring number four and room number five

1064
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,119
where Burgers would have expected the

1065
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,200
better off

1066
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,119
residents who have climbed a social

1067
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,760
leather you can still see that even

1068
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,640
today these are indeed the places where

1069
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,940
you find almost exclusively white

1070
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,880
dominated neighborhoods and so this this

1071
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,260
is still the case

1072
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,240
and so this ring number four and five

1073
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,700
are still there

1074
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,380
is an omen

1075
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,260
multiple nucleus

1076
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,260
clusters

1077
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,880
yeah you can indeed find for example if

1078
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,619
you see an example

1079
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,180
like is there is

1080
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,260
okay so indeed you have a cluster of

1081
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,200
this Hispanic people who self-identify

1082
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,960
as Islamic in the South and that's

1083
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,400
around this uh calumet's River

1084
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,140
industry area

1085
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:48,420
yeah you also have a cluster of whites

1086
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,160
in a sector that is

1087
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,559
blue that is dominated by people who

1088
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,119
self-identified as black and this is

1089
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,540
this a University of Chicago premises

1090
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:04,380
so up to today you can still see

1091
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,339
uh remnants of this Harrison Omen model

1092
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:11,160
and also the reasons why they wanted to

1093
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,099
refine or give more detail to this

1094
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:17,660
concentric green model and sector

1095
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,059
so I hope that these models

1096
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:23,819
make you think about how different

1097
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:27,059
cities look like and that they also make

1098
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:29,880
you aware of well in different types of

1099
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,839
cities

1100
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,000
you have different ethnic groups

1101
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,280
different social economic classes

1102
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,220
make taking out different parts and this

1103
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,619
can be very different but Brussels for

1104
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,980
example is a city where poverty is very

1105
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,319
Central

1106
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,079
we have the medieval city but then when

1107
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:51,599
you go out of the vehicle you get to the

1108
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,420
19th century development related to

1109
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,520
industrialization this is where you find

1110
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,680
the poorest neighborhood versus cattle

1111
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,920
Beach

1112
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,540
these are poor districts

1113
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,780
very close to the medieval

1114
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,819
you have other kinds of cities for

1115
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,819
example Paris where you have much more

1116
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:17,460
wealth close to the city center and

1117
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,020
where you have much of the poverty and

1118
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,119
very peripheral locations

1119
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,819
and so it is interesting to compare

1120
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:26,400
different cities and to understand where

1121
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,520
is poverty located where do different

1122
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,400
racial ethnic groups live in in the city

1123
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,260
and so when you do that

1124
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,140
you will also be able to make a a

1125
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,839
simplified model of the city that you

1126
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:44,880
are familiar with for the city that you

1127
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,040
want to study and you will also come to

1128
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,960
an understanding that these burgers and

1129
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,839
poison Arizona bubbles are very

1130
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,960
simplistic and that in different

1131
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,059
countries in different cities you would

1132
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:59,220
have very different models

1133
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,619
and I have a couple of examples

1134
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:04,740
this is one from Piercy that is also

1135
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,800
used in the textbook where you have in

1136
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,460
the British complex is Council Estates

1137
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,940
yeah built on peripheral land and so in

1138
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,940
a concentric ring where Alice harrisman

1139
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,760
and Burgess would expect private

1140
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,339
Suburban housing we also have these

1141
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,800
Council Estates just like these born

1142
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,800
years in the French context where much

1143
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,319
of the poverty is peripheral

1144
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:37,079
yeah while that contradicts Birds

1145
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,300
the Chinese

1146
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,920
city was ever a word of the change

1147
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:48,359
my pronunciation will be very cool okay

1148
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,160
nobody cities in China also fast growing

1149
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,819
in China you basically have a new look

1150
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:03,680
for an urban citizenship

1151
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,140
foreign

1152
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,960
and you have villages

1153
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,940
which

1154
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,599
were taken up by farmers

1155
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,420
which are rural pieces of land where you

1156
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,400
have people with this brutal citizenship

1157
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,640
with the rural living when people from

1158
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,940
the countryside migrate to the city they

1159
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,180
are able to take up residence in these

1160
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,020
old villages

1161
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,359
their citizenship if I may say it like

1162
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:39,180
that allows them to stay in this area

1163
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:43,380
so you have in many Chinese cities parts

1164
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,599
of the city that look like that where

1165
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,359
you have a very formal part immediately

1166
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:51,480
next to a part of the city that looks

1167
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,420
much more informal much more dense and

1168
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,819
that's because when the city grows over

1169
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:00,180
this Countryside that these brutal

1170
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,440
villages

1171
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,800
from the past become these villages in

1172
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,119
the city where you have a lot of

1173
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:09,119
newcomers arrived and so these Chinese

1174
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,579
cities the model of the Chinese City

1175
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:14,819
would look very differently from Burgers

1176
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:18,660
because you have these areas that

1177
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,599
used to be Villages or centers of

1178
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,160
religious and where you have people with

1179
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,960
immigrating from Countryside from other

1180
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,099
parts of China who arrived there uh

1181
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:35,640
to this change I think it means

1182
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,740
something like Village in the city

1183
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,359
and these are foreign

1184
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,240
the African City

1185
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,500
at the flag of from 1962 very different

1186
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,079
again because transport is much more

1187
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,359
complicated

1188
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:57,359
and so rich people prefer to live close

1189
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,880
to the citizen and the poorest of the

1190
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,380
food who arrive from the countryside

1191
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,140
will arrive at the very ends of the city

1192
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,359
a very peripheral locations where it

1193
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:09,839
takes you two or three hours to get

1194
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:14,099
so these cities look different again

1195
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:15,900
Mike Davis

1196
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,540
Los Angeles you might have heard of The

1197
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,119
Chicago School burgers for example that

1198
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,380
you might also have heard of those

1199
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,380
angels group or of course modern

1200
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:27,540
photographers writing from Los Angeles

1201
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,240
and Mike Davis and who wrote an

1202
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,940
interesting book in 1992 and trying to

1203
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,260
make the 1998 UFC who made a model of

1204
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,500
how that Los Angeles looked like in the

1205
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,280
90s yeah and you might have heard of

1206
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,720
Skid Row

1207
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,940
it's a part of the city where you have

1208
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,099
thousands of homeless people

1209
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,619
and living on the streets just next to

1210
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:54,240
the central business district of Los

1211
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,040
Angeles say this is the zone of

1212
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,859
transition and this is where the poorest

1213
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:00,839
of the poor live

1214
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,180
immediately next to the central business

1215
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,260
district

1216
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,780
but you also end up at that time these

1217
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,720
gated to developments

1218
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,059
at the periphery of the city where you

1219
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:15,240
had the richest of the rich living in

1220
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,700
these gated suburbs so you could also

1221
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,819
see that basically this

1222
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:23,220
borders between the different Rings were

1223
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,440
being walled and fortified

1224
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,660
enclaves

1225
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,359
so he was trying to make a mobile

1226
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:35,160
of Los Angeles in the 1990s

1227
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,740
barred by this desperate poverty some

1228
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:41,339
parts of the city and then also this

1229
00:58:41,339 --> 00:58:42,000
um

1230
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,119
both in other parts

1231
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,099
and in the end there are still a lot of

1232
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:49,680
burgers in this model there's still the

1233
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,299
Central Business districts that are

1234
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:53,660
still core and there is still this

1235
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,619
poorest of the poor Living Community

1236
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,319
mixed not in the zone of transition

1237
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,020
between which the factories and then

1238
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,420
this little hell or Little Sicily that

1239
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,880
people living on the streets

1240
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,819
and then the the more you move out of

1241
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:10,440
the city center the Richer this

1242
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,339
neighborhoods get it's also very much

1243
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:18,540
so try to make a model of Los Angeles in

1244
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,540
1998

1245
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:27,059
yeah I I

1246
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:29,460
one hour ago I took out a slide with a

1247
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,280
bottle for talent and again trying to

1248
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,640
understand for the post-socialist city

1249
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,700
and look like but then also

1250
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,980
using Talon as an example but also

1251
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,480
trying to understand like what kind of

1252
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,940
developments do we see in these

1253
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,099
socialist cities and then in these

1254
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,859
post-socials and how can we try to

1255
00:59:49,859 --> 00:59:52,559
generalize that simplify

1256
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,440
and so the attempts to make a model is

1257
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,140
an attempt to simplify reality and to

1258
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,740
try and understand what is particular

1259
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:04,319
about cities and what makes Los Angeles

1260
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:08,160
different from Chicago in 1925

1261
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,400
so you also have indeed bubbles for

1262
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,940
European cities this was a British City

1263
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:17,460
kearsely in this Council Estates but you

1264
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,740
could also make a model for Stockholm

1265
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,599
and try to think like what is specific

1266
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,819
about Stockholm I'll just look forward

1267
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:27,140
compared to other cities

1268
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,540
not that I know because this this

1269
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:43,020
attempt has been like it's very much

1270
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,940
um and indeed you could think how these

1271
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,000
assumptions that Burgers Sunday

1272
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,099
or the diet stand up on the slide and

1273
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:52,559
they finally the textbook whether some

1274
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,700
of them are

1275
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,720
at typically

1276
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,059
like for example this idea that cannot

1277
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:03,059
be an early invention so European cities

1278
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,380
tend to have

1279
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,720
a long history and so for that reason

1280
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,460
there are always parts of the city

1281
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,460
equipment is already something you have

1282
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,240
a growing City

1283
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,819
there's also much more State

1284
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:25,339
intervention

1285
01:01:25,339 --> 01:01:28,619
so we could think like how the European

1286
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:31,319
city would be different from uh these

1287
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:32,940
assumptions of burgers and what that

1288
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,540
would mean then for the model works

1289
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,760
I have no bundled but it could be an

1290
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,559
interesting it could be an interesting

1291
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,920
exercise

1292
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:51,260
and is it something like it

1293
01:01:58,619 --> 01:01:59,880
so

1294
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,780
it might also

1295
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,980
um

1296
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,480
in different areas

1297
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,540
um

1298
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,359
but some was less strict and less

1299
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,119
regulated and it is nowadays yeah when

1300
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,160
you also when you have a city that's

1301
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,660
growing that fast

1302
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,819
that is having one million extra

1303
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:45,240
inhabitants in the very short period of

1304
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,819
time yeah then the city grows very

1305
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:49,740
organically I guess and it's also very

1306
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,420
hard as a planner to keep up with the

1307
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:56,119
pace but the city is scrolling it

1308
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,420
regulation

1309
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,579
when exactly it was taken

1310
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:05,119
States

1311
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,870
um

1312
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,240
[Music]

1313
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,220
okay and can you read it

1314
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,059
or not snow

1315
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,400
well I will ever ever look whether I can

1316
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,240
I can see

1317
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,660
okay I see some comments yeah

1318
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,579
in the example from China how does the

1319
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:34,559
ownership of people with State work is

1320
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,520
the city grows over these villages

1321
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,400
[Music]

1322
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,400
um

1323
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:47,400
okay I will I will I will it's it's time

1324
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,599
for a break

1325
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:50,339
um I will have a look at I will have a

1326
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:52,819
look at what I find it in public

1327
01:03:52,819 --> 01:03:56,220
that it's hard for me to check this live

1328
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,799
stream that also I also need to get out

1329
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,740
of PowerPoint to check that out I am

1330
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,420
teaching mostly for the people here and

1331
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,960
I hope that the live stream Works more

1332
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,480
I'm at let's say five minutes break

1333
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,720
um it's four past six on my clock here

1334
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,540
so let's start again uh nine past six or

1335
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:18,260
ten past six

1336
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:23,839
let's see

1337
01:04:47,299 --> 01:04:50,420
what's up

1338
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,020

foreign

1342
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,660

let's talk

1354
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,260
questions

1355
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,980
let's continue

1356
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:18,840
with the conclusion for the first uh

1357
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,800
hour of the class

1358
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:25,460
let's go through it it seems

1359
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:29,340
that Urban differentiation the fact that

1360
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,080
rich and poor little different

1361
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,580
neighborhoods the fact that you have

1362
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,620
people from different ethnicities

1363
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,860
different generations of newcomers that

1364
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,080
they live in different neighborhoods

1365
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,120
somehow that seems to be some

1366
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,780
characteristic of most if not all cities

1367
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:49,040
I've been showing you models from Africa

1368
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,739
Los Angeles Chicago

1369
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:55,140
and United Kingdom

1370
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,820
and I've been talking about this model

1371
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:00,060
of the Socialist or both socialists it

1372
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,620
seems that in each of these levels there

1373
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:04,380
is this idea that different groups of

1374
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,840
society whether you define them in

1375
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,760
socioeconomic classes or different

1376
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,060
ethnicities or

1377
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:14,460
self-identify as a racist but these

1378
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,840
different groups they have different

1379
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,120
parts of a city

1380
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,540
but it also seems the difference local

1381
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,780
features impact upon perfect forum

1382
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:28,199
for example this Lake in Chicago

1383
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:29,940
and you could see that there are

1384
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,280
references to the wind's Direction in

1385
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,280
some of these models migration patterns

1386
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,460
Etc and obviously also local policies

1387
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,100
and a transport system

1388
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,620
a snake intervention in housing this ID

1389
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:46,500
for example is canceled Estates for the

1390
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,040
following years

1391
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,300
and restrictions of mobility in a in the

1392
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,260
Chinese complex system determining where

1393
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:00,420
uh to live or where you could set your

1394
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,480
kids to school uh strategies to counter

1395
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,140
policies so that also means that most of

1396
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,360
these models of urban form even if they

1397
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,040
say this is the model of the American

1398
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,860
city that they somehow wear birthmarks

1399
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,420
that they are situated in a specific

1400
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,440
space

1401
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:21,060
in a specific type of Chicago or 1920s

1402
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:24,420
was a model of the growing city and the

1403
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:27,480
place already 10 years later

1404
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,820
and this American economy has been hit

1405
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,400
by crisis this model did not fall true

1406
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,560
anymore because the city was not growing

1407
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,960
at that fast pace and so it's always

1408
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,800
about situating these models in time and

1409
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,780
space and so that also makes it

1410
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,780
necessary to provincialize

1411
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,920
theories so much

1412
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,000
um I'd like to show you some exam

1413
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,980
questions to make you think like how how

1414
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:55,159
will I ever

1415
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:57,300
make you

1416
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,580
uh like what kind of questions could you

1417
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,500
expect from this and this is a question

1418
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,140
that I've asked in 2016.

1419
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,179
and you have the model of the South

1420
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:09,000
African post-apartheid City by a

1421
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,860
particular author and you know how

1422
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,699
familiar all of you are with this video

1423
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,920
in South Africa repeal of this Advantage

1424
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,179
loss

1425
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:20,840
ES

1426
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,140
and so you there are some references to

1427
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,880
this Legend

1428
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,880
and then I ask you which elements of

1429
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,100
burgers voids and Harrison

1430
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:37,679
do you recognize in this model boxes

1431
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,380
yeah so there could be a way to check

1432
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,020
whether you've understood what these

1433
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,880
models are about whether you're able to

1434
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,159
apply that and to another one

1435
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:01,440
I found it in a book but I don't

1436
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,620
remember

1437
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:07,380
if you would have a look I know I do it

1438
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:12,239
I can look it up now

1439
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,980
both publicly

1440
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:17,480
I can tell you also because

1441
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,620
um

1442
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:22,080
so first hour these classical models of

1443
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,000
Earth but also some more recent

1444
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,480
place with these World models

1445
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,000
but I'm going to discuss now is patterns

1446
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,380
of segregation

1447
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,300
yeah

1448
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:40,140
how can we look at segregation in cities

1449
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:44,040
and I will use the definition by two

1450
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,000
American Authors again Messi and mental

1451
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,540
Douglas Messi and Nancy dancer to

1452
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,120
American sociologists who wrote a book

1453
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,100
called American apartment

1454
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,620
so you see this reference to the South

1455
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,140
African cities but in the thinking on

1456
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,179
segregation this book has been quite

1457
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:04,380
important

1458
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,719
and so you see here what is the

1459
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:07,800
definition

1460
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,600
first of all they focus on the

1461
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,360
residential segregation I could also

1462
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,659
discuss segregation in Leisure spaces

1463
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:18,659
how many people 's Force for the places

1464
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:20,880
where people spend their Leisure Time

1465
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,120
our desegregated or I could look at work

1466
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,860
segregation to people of different

1467
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,920
socio-economic classes meet each other

1468
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,219
but most of the work on segregation

1469
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:37,980
focuses on residential section what is

1470
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:40,739
residential segregation it's a degree to

1471
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:43,800
reach two or four groups however you

1472
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,739
find it live separately from each other

1473
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:49,260
in different parts of the urban

1474
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,580
environment

1475
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:54,239
adult Solutions and what you've seen in

1476
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,040
these models that I've been showing you

1477
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,739
in the previous hours is that in most

1478
01:16:58,739 --> 01:16:59,699
cities

1479
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,000
different groups

1480
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,179
whether you define them in a

1481
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:07,920
socio-economic way

1482
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,060
for in this ethnicity race

1483
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,640
self-identifying

1484
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,040
that indeed in all of these cities

1485
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,860
different groups live in different parts

1486
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,260
of the city and so in each of these

1487
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:24,900
cities where this models are

1488
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,600
right it would make sense to look at

1489
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,000
residential circulation

1490
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,100
but what is important is that messian

1491
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,040
doesn't want to make this more complex

1492
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,900
and they say most of the research on

1493
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,239
segregation has been too simplistic

1494
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,340
because it looked at segregation in one

1495
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,020
particular way

1496
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:46,140
and so what I'm going to do with you now

1497
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,679
is to look at or discuss five dimensions

1498
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,179
of segregation

1499
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:53,159
a pharmacy and then these are called

1500
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:56,659
evenness exposure concentration

1501
01:17:56,659 --> 01:17:59,400
centralization and clustering

1502
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,699
and most of the research on segregation

1503
01:18:01,699 --> 01:18:05,460
is discussing evenness and so I will

1504
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:09,719
also look at it what is evenness

1505
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,940
evenness refers

1506
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:14,580
and I'm just reading what you see on the

1507
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:17,219
slide now refers to the differential

1508
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:20,820
distribution of two social groups

1509
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,940
among aerial units in a city

1510
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,280
and so a minority group

1511
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,800
is said to be segregated if it is

1512
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,659
unevenly distributed over aerial units

1513
01:18:32,659 --> 01:18:36,120
evenness is not measured in any absolute

1514
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,120
sense but is scaled relative to some

1515
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,380
other group

1516
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:44,340
so we are able to say and this city

1517
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,260
this is the example that you see there

1518
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:50,580
the lights are segregated from Plex

1519
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:54,719
or the low socioeconomic classes if you

1520
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,060
may call that same like this are

1521
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:00,020
segregated from

1522
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:04,199
rich is segregated from so you always

1523
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:06,480
need these two

1524
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:11,960
so you see here that you can have index

1525
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,940
I will use this here

1526
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,460
an index of this similarity can be

1527
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,860
calculated and I will give you two

1528
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,199
examples

1529
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:24,719
some years this goes rather well and

1530
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,219
sometimes

1531
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:28,620
this goes rather wrong imagine that you

1532
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:31,140
have a city that is made up of

1533
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,940
four districts

1534
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,300
and in each of these

1535
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,640
you have 75

1536
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:43,440
whites and 25 legs

1537
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,920
what would be

1538
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,840
the index

1539
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,159
of this similarity when I use

1540
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,659
the major layer

1541
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:56,520
we need to paste

1542
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:00,540
off of the sum yeah that is what this

1543
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,840
great Sigma is mean and now we need to

1544
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,060
for each of these neighborhoods we need

1545
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,940
to say what is the black population in

1546
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,640
an area

1547
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:14,100
divided by the total black population 25

1548
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:18,620
25 100 minus

1549
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:23,040
75 the white population in area one

1550
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,719
divided by the total white population

1551
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,100
what do we have here for one

1552
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,640
neighborhood

1553
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:34,400
zero

1554
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:37,560
I need to calculate the sum for of this

1555
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,960
measure for each of these neighborhoods

1556
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,780
so that will be zero plus zero plus zero

1557
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:47,040
to zero one half of 0 is 0.

1558
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,400
the index of this similarity would be

1559
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,659
zero

1560
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:54,060
or zero percent

1561
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,980
this corresponds with the effect that

1562
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,600
you need to move

1563
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,400
zero percent

1564
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,800
of the population in order to get an

1565
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,380
even distribution of white and black

1566
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:07,380
across the city because you have an even

1567
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,300
distribution in each of these four

1568
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:13,560
neighborhoods you have as many whites as

1569
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:17,239
you have in other parts of the system

1570
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,360
um you can also look at another exhaust

1571
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,699
where you would have

1572
01:21:23,699 --> 01:21:27,960
100 Plex living in one neighborhood

1573
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,199
100 whites in another

1574
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,900
100 whites in another and another 100

1575
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,360
white in another name

1576
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,300
if you would make the calculation now

1577
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:41,159
then you would get to one

1578
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:43,140
not going to do that with you but for

1579
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,880
those who

1580
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,860
are able to do this this means the

1581
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,260
absolute number of this so if you get to

1582
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,360
a negative number here then it becomes

1583
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,060
positive again when you calculate it it

1584
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,640
will be

1585
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,980
then the number will be one

1586
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,140
yeah

1587
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,179
um because you can I can still do that

1588
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:07,199
with you there's a sum of 100 the number

1589
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,000
of blacks in the first neighborhood

1590
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,679
minus 100 the total number of legs minus

1591
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:16,820
the number of whites

1592
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:20,880
and for each node each of these

1593
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,880
neighborhoods you will get uh to the

1594
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:24,980
number

1595
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:28,500
uh one and here you will get one third

1596
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:32,159
one third one third total two uh half of

1597
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,860
two so one meaning you need to move 100

1598
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:36,659
of the population

1599
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:39,600
in order to get an even distribution of

1600
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,940
these population groups across the city

1601
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,920
either you move

1602
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,380
33 Flex

1603
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,320
from this neighborhood to this

1604
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,520
neighborhoods

1605
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,920
yeah and then you can get if you move 33

1606
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,260
to each of these then you get an even

1607
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,179
distribution of blacks across the city

1608
01:22:57,179 --> 01:22:59,580
or you move all the white people through

1609
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:02,100
that black neighborhood and then you

1610
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,960
would also get to it even descriptions

1611
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,120
of people across the city according to

1612
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,380
this neighborhoods

1613
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,659
yeah and so this index of this

1614
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:11,460
singularity

1615
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:15,780
ranges from zero even distribution to

1616
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:18,480
one very uneven distinction

1617
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,520
and basically it corresponds with the

1618
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,320
percentage of people that you're with

1619
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,380
oof in order to get an even distribution

1620
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,900
of people across different neighborhoods

1621
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,780
and so this may be complicated but you

1622
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:33,719
can just look at the practice so how

1623
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:35,820
does this look like you would get to a

1624
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:36,840
number

1625
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,540
this is this percentage

1626
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:40,500
[Music]

1627
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:41,340
um

1628
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,100
and what you see here for example is

1629
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,179
that

1630
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:48,980
um so zero plus an even distribution

1631
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:51,679
that was this example

1632
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,560
150 uneven yeah so the more you move to

1633
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,460
the right on this slide more uneven the

1634
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,280
cities are so what is particular is that

1635
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,960
you see that first of all American

1636
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,480
cities tend to be much more penetrated

1637
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,420
than European ones

1638
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,360
yeah so segregation when you look at the

1639
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,239
dimensions even this

1640
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:17,699
then you find out that in American

1641
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:21,020
cities the poor for example are living

1642
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,420
much more in particular parts of the

1643
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:26,760
city and in the European context they

1644
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,040
are a bit more spread across different

1645
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,900
parts of the city

1646
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,100
yeah

1647
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:36,300
and so you see here for different cities

1648
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,000
for different population groups

1649
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,280
you see how this has been

1650
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,440
yeah and again you always need to

1651
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,239
compare it with another population group

1652
01:24:45,239 --> 01:24:47,760
so what has done is the tour of ends

1653
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,380
verb compared to it than the ones who

1654
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,020
are not considered

1655
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:55,440
okay and so it's also interesting for

1656
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,900
those who join me to enter

1657
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,820
to see that according to these

1658
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:04,980
statistics poverty enhancer in 2005. was

1659
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:08,000
also much more

1660
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,100
unevenly spread across the city and so

1661
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,600
you had particular neighborhoods where

1662
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,760
you had uh

1663
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,040
that were marked by poverty much more

1664
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,560
than in other Europeans

1665
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,540
this will also be a scale issue for

1666
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:25,080
Belgium and we have very small

1667
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,380
statistical sectors that will be part of

1668
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:29,520
the explanation

1669
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,040
scale is important when these sectors

1670
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,500
grow they will mask some of the

1671
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,960
concentrations of poverty of Health that

1672
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,600
you've been getting the statistics are

1673
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,440
defined

1674
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:47,719
so this measure of evenness

1675
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:51,120
some more numbers

1676
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,179
again you see that

1677
01:25:53,179 --> 01:25:56,900
90 and so you get close to one

1678
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:00,300
Birmingham Bangladesh I read there all

1679
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,179
time Bangladesh

1680
01:26:02,179 --> 01:26:06,239
so apparently it is Bangladeshi in UK

1681
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,199
cities

1682
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,560
are living very much in particular

1683
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,239
neighborhoods of the city and in these

1684
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,980
neighborhoods

1685
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:16,020
you would find almost exclusively

1686
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:19,320
Bangladesh and that explains why you

1687
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,239
would need to move almost all these

1688
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:23,699
Bangladeshi to other neighborhoods if

1689
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:24,900
you would like to get to an even

1690
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,920
distribution of Bangladeshi in UK cities

1691
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,040
and so you see how this measure is being

1692
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,980
used in order to say something about

1693
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,860
residential segregation in these

1694
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,460
different cities

1695
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:45,000
poverty in Copenhagen the first Quinta

1696
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,600
quintile will be like the first 20 of

1697
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,239
the people according to the income

1698
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:54,320
income distribution is much less

1699
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,300
segregated and it's spread much more

1700
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:00,540
evenly across the city than it is in

1701
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:04,139
only other cities that are listed there

1702
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:06,540
so do you understand what this measure

1703
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:11,600
of evenness unevenness means

1704
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,520
okay I get now to these four other

1705
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,460
dimensions so what messian are arguing

1706
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,139
is that we have been looking at

1707
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:21,480
segregation mostly through this lens of

1708
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,340
evenness

1709
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,100
there are also four other times

1710
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,199
which are worthwhile looking at the

1711
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:31,800
question I'm sorry for that example with

1712
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,520
the 100 black presidents and one in this

1713
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,600
record

1714
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,600
I didn't think what does it

1715
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,060
what does it mean for it to be one-third

1716
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:47,300
for the for my residential conception

1717
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:52,380
well I'm I'm just I am just for each of

1718
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,600
these neighborhoods

1719
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:59,159
I am calculating I didn't want to go too

1720
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:03,480
much into this I am calculating this

1721
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,360
and I start from the black neighborhoods

1722
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,100
they're the measure or the number will

1723
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:11,159
be 100 divided by 100 the total number

1724
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:13,739
of likes minus net neighborhood in our

1725
01:28:13,739 --> 01:28:16,500
zero whites divided by total number of Y

1726
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,199
is 300. that will be one

1727
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,600
for the white neighborhoods

1728
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,699
yeah and I have three of them

1729
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:25,560
the measure will be there are zero

1730
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:29,460
blacks and I have minus 100 the number

1731
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:31,440
of Lights in that neighborhood divided

1732
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,320
by the total number of bites 300.

1733
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:38,880
yeah so I get here to 1 divided by three

1734
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:43,980
so I get one plus one third one plus one

1735
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:46,800
third plus one third two

1736
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,600
two divided by two is one

1737
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,040
but it doesn't say anything about its

1738
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,900
neighborhoods I'm calculating something

1739
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,420
at the scale of the city and for that

1740
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:59,460
for that I need to calculate this

1741
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,860
measure for these four neighborhoods

1742
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:04,560
oh okay

1743
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,800
and then I so I I think I kind of

1744
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,659
realize

1745
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:13,020
and then I need to make the Sun

1746
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:16,199
of this number in each of these so that

1747
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:19,139
will be some of

1748
01:29:19,139 --> 01:29:21,659
one plus

1749
01:29:21,659 --> 01:29:24,659
perspective

1750
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,699
and I need to divide it

1751
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:30,840
right

1752
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,340
that's why

1753
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,699
so the index of the similarity is one

1754
01:29:35,699 --> 01:29:39,420
in each this case 100 percent meaning

1755
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:40,679
that

1756
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:44,760
either 100 percent of flex or 100 of y's

1757
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,280
need to move in order to get to an even

1758
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,500
distribution of both whites and Bricks

1759
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,520
across the city

1760
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:57,020
okay

1761
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,620
four other yeah

1762
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:09,569
[Music]

1763
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,239
yeah that's the percentage

1764
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,760
so then this would be 100

1765
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,219
and this would be zero and if the index

1766
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:33,000
of this similarity would be 0.5

1767
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,219
then you would have 50 percent

1768
01:30:35,219 --> 01:30:38,699
and that would be 50 years

1769
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:41,340
so you move close to one and you are

1770
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,380
close to

1771
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:45,239
this is a measure that you would often

1772
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:47,420
find

1773
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,440
I could also be often

1774
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,739
checked like our segregation

1775
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:55,440
uh changing across time

1776
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,239
that would be the index of the

1777
01:30:57,239 --> 01:31:00,300
similarity for first Handler has moved

1778
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,460
from

1779
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:05,580
0.40 to 0.50 meaning poor people got

1780
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:08,340
more concentrated over time

1781
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:12,199
for more cigarette sorry yeah

1782
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:16,560
I got less evenly distributed across

1783
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,739
five

1784
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,940
okay four other

1785
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,340
Dimensions I'm going to move through

1786
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,900
them rather quickly

1787
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:28,760
residential exposure reversively

1788
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:32,580
sorry refers to the degree of potential

1789
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:33,960
contacts

1790
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:37,260
yeah or the possibility of interaction

1791
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,620
in this case

1792
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:42,659
in each of the neighborhoods there is a

1793
01:31:42,659 --> 01:31:45,480
similar degree of exposure here there is

1794
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,520
when when these people limit their lives

1795
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,560
to the neighborhood there will be no

1796
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,120
exposures

1797
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,820
yeah and so this degree is

1798
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:56,219
pretty close to evenness but not

1799
01:31:56,219 --> 01:32:00,659
completely because for exposure and the

1800
01:32:00,659 --> 01:32:03,540
number will also be depending upon the

1801
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:06,360
total size of these communities

1802
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,239
if the total black population in the

1803
01:32:09,239 --> 01:32:10,800
city is very low

1804
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,260
then the chances that you will get to

1805
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:15,179
meet a black person are are lower

1806
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:19,020
already yeah so the size of the group is

1807
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:20,699
important if you would make a measure

1808
01:32:20,699 --> 01:32:23,840
for exposure

1809
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,460
concentration Dimension number three

1810
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:28,800
refers to the relative amount of

1811
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,500
physical space occupied by a minority

1812
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,719
group in the urban environment

1813
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:36,239
this will be again be dependent upon the

1814
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,040
size of this one

1815
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,139
we have here Manhattan

1816
01:32:40,139 --> 01:32:42,360
and we have in these different colors

1817
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,060
again these different ethnic or racial

1818
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:48,120
groups or people self-identifying with a

1819
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:52,040
particular group and so you see that in

1820
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:55,500
shades of purple you have the Asian

1821
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,320
population and so you have

1822
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,440
China done and that's where most of

1823
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,980
these Asians are concentrated they take

1824
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:08,219
up a very small amount of space this is

1825
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:11,520
a dense neighborhood and most Asians

1826
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,800
living in Manhattan or living in that

1827
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,920
particular part of an exit and so

1828
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,360
concentration

1829
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,639
the relative amount of physical space

1830
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,880
occupied by a minority group

1831
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:27,980
number four centralizing

1832
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,600
it relates to the degree to which a

1833
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,120
group is spatially located near the

1834
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,159
center of an earth

1835
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:37,620
I don't know what the center of New York

1836
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,780
would be but if you say it's Wall Street

1837
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:43,139
then these Asians are living very

1838
01:33:43,139 --> 01:33:45,600
centralized

1839
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,760
and while black Africans

1840
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,179
in the case of New York are not living

1841
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:53,960
centralized

1842
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,580
the same goes for this example of

1843
01:33:56,580 --> 01:34:00,360
poverty in Brussels poverty is very much

1844
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:03,139
centralized

1845
01:34:03,239 --> 01:34:04,679
neighborhoods which are marked by

1846
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:08,520
poverty are close to the city center

1847
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:11,780
Parisian case poverty is very much

1848
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:14,880
decentralized that's much more an issue

1849
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,440
of this peripheral Bond years

1850
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:22,560
and in the last Dimension is clustery

1851
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,380
the degree to which is

1852
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:28,260
um aerial units inhabited by minority

1853
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:32,219
members and join one another or not

1854
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:34,980
I don't know how familiar you are with

1855
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:35,940
New York

1856
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:38,520
but I remember walking out of the metro

1857
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,280
station and Flushing close to Flushing

1858
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,040
Meadows where you have the tennis

1859
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,420
tournament and that was another

1860
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:48,060
neighborhood and that was very much

1861
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:51,360
marked by a presence of Chinese people

1862
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,060
yeah so you have

1863
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:54,920
um

1864
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,179
clusters of

1865
01:34:57,179 --> 01:35:01,199
at least two clusters of Agents one in

1866
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,060
this Chinatown Manhattan and then

1867
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:06,480
another one somewhere here in Flushing

1868
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,600
yeah and so is

1869
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,780
um the presence of Asians is it cluster

1870
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:16,860
no because there is two neighborhoods

1871
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:18,480
um which are quite far away from each

1872
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,659
other

1873
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:26,219
evenness exposure

1874
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:28,920
what was it centralization concentration

1875
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:33,000
plus two and so I could also ask you

1876
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,219
in the exam

1877
01:35:35,219 --> 01:35:37,739
to discuss

1878
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:40,260
the three most relevant dimensions of

1879
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:42,300
Messi and length are the ones that you

1880
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,719
still remember

1881
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:47,179
um out of these five to discuss

1882
01:35:47,179 --> 01:35:51,179
socio-economic segregation requests

1883
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:54,840
is over the clustered or not

1884
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,880
centralized

1885
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,040
is it concentrated

1886
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,440
or is there an evenness

1887
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,600
yeah the data might allow you to say

1888
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,460
something about it or not

1889
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:11,940
um I already told you when I pointed at

1890
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:15,920
this High numbers of unevenness in enter

1891
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,020
But scale is very important

1892
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:21,900
yeah if this is

1893
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,840
a pattern of rich and poor

1894
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:27,900
then you will only detect it as

1895
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:30,960
segregation when you are able to study

1896
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,560
it at the scale of these

1897
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:36,600
specific neighborhoods and if your

1898
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,540
statistical units are this big

1899
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:41,940
then it would be then this would be a

1900
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:44,639
very even when you're able to study it

1901
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:45,420
at

1902
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:49,860
this scale then this is a very uneven

1903
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:53,520
and so the more refined these statistics

1904
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,520
allow you to go the higher one would

1905
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:59,880
assume these levels of segregation or

1906
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,760
evenness and evenness will also be

1907
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:06,239
so scale and the scale through which you

1908
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:09,600
look so is something very uh important

1909
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,280
as well

1910
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,440
I saw a hand somewhere at the back I

1911
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,520
don't know where the description is

1912
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,300
still relevant yes

1913
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,080
um

1914
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:42,719
well I could imagine for example where

1915
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:45,020
you have a CBD

1916
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:48,300
and where do you have four neighborhoods

1917
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:51,600
around the CBD parked by poverty

1918
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,120
and you would say that poverty is

1919
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:55,620
centralized

1920
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,780
but it's not clustered

1921
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:02,900
and it is also is it concentrated then

1922
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,980
relative amount of space yeah

1923
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:10,020
they are related to each other but

1924
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:12,659
there's still something distinct about

1925
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:14,520
it you could also have concentrations of

1926
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:17,760
poverty which are very decentralized

1927
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,159
I still put the poor take a very little

1928
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:23,159
space but this is far away from the city

1929
01:38:23,159 --> 01:38:24,060
center

1930
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,679
and then the question could still be

1931
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:28,260
whether this poverty is clustered

1932
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,179
whether you have in the east of the city

1933
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:31,679
or

1934
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:35,460
districts which are adjacents

1935
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,380
to each other where is poverty is

1936
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:42,120
concentrated or whether this poverty is

1937
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,880
also decentralized

1938
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,219
but also not clustered and not

1939
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:50,100
conceptual and so you you could you

1940
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:53,520
could imagine a

1941
01:38:54,739 --> 01:38:57,239
is centralized

1942
01:38:57,239 --> 01:38:59,520
and you would also expect it to be

1943
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,900
somewhere close to it

1944
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:07,400
or not about for for

1945
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,840
groups of people in the city

1946
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,860
like

1947
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,860
um

1948
01:39:24,739 --> 01:39:27,900
and you would say poverty is centralized

1949
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,460
in

1950
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:32,340
the poor people are centralized in

1951
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,800
Brussels rich people are not because

1952
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,360
they live mostly on the periphery

1953
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:58,520
something yeah

1954
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,300
well then it will still be relevant to

1955
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,719
say that

1956
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:07,820
okay so five dimensions of segregation

1957
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:11,159
which also allow you to speak

1958
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:13,500
with a little bit more detail about the

1959
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,980
social differentiation that you find

1960
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:18,960
so it's not only about evenness

1961
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:21,120
people living in different neighborhoods

1962
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,400
of the city you can also discuss

1963
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,100
concentration clustering centralization

1964
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:28,620
exposure

1965
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:31,380
you have another question sorry are you

1966
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:33,719
starting with the confiscation

1967
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:36,360
um does it like matter like the portion

1968
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,600
like the size of the population like I

1969
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,400
can imagine a city that they're just not

1970
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,860
very many very few people are poor there

1971
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,719
and then you could have a couple of

1972
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:48,540
neighborhoods well and

1973
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:50,760
it would be called concentrated but you

1974
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,460
could also Imagine a situated

1975
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:56,820
power of many people yeah I must admit

1976
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:59,639
that I I don't know exactly how this

1977
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:01,440
would be measured and how you would

1978
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,739
operationalize such a measure but here

1979
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:06,780
it will be about

1980
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:09,000
like the size of the group

1981
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,360
how how many Chinese do you have to be

1982
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,040
about the density so they were talking

1983
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,320
about the tower it will also be if they

1984
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,900
take a less square meters if they live

1985
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,880
um but I don't I don't know how you

1986
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,000
would exactly operationalize that in

1987
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,400
this kind of way

1988
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,980
but for me the important thing is that

1989
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:33,239
you understand that there are different

1990
01:41:33,239 --> 01:41:34,860
dimensions so that you can understand

1991
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:35,880
this

1992
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,460
uh spatial differentiation between rich

1993
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:41,219
or between like

1994
01:41:41,219 --> 01:41:44,219
or between male and female or between

1995
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:45,719
Global sexual

1996
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:46,920
but

1997
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,900
she can look at it in many different

1998
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,880
ways that you would be able to study it

1999
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,840
through these fine language

2000
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:58,260
for me that's that's uh that's important

2001
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:00,300
and I will not ask you how to measure

2002
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:02,880
that's around to how to operationalize

2003
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:03,960
that

2004
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,820
I hope that you understand that it can

2005
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:08,280
be meaningful

2006
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:11,040
um to do this and that this is for

2007
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,780
example uh

2008
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:15,119
figure from the work of this festival's

2009
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,400
photographer from Belgium who said well

2010
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,639
you have different kinds of cities

2011
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:22,500
topological and dramatic cities and it

2012
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,659
matters whether the rich for example

2013
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:26,880
still need to you could imagine cities

2014
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,739
where rich

2015
01:42:28,739 --> 01:42:31,500
do not need to come who do not need to

2016
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,260
speak to for example in the Brussels

2017
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:36,420
case these poor neighborhoods are so

2018
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:40,679
closely really so closely

2019
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:41,940
um

2020
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:44,639
located to these neighborhoods where

2021
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,679
rich people work for example

2022
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:48,420
that you will get a lot of conflicts

2023
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:50,760
around around space but in other kinds

2024
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,580
of city that would not necessarily be

2025
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:55,500
the case yeah and so for that for that

2026
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:58,739
reason these kind of Dimensions do

2027
01:42:58,739 --> 01:43:01,159
matter

2028
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:03,540
and I could I could ask you to apply

2029
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:06,900
that to a particular City

2030
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,719
okay 17 minutes left to discuss the

2031
01:43:09,719 --> 01:43:12,480
causes of segregation so why is it

2032
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:16,199
that different population groups take up

2033
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:19,560
different parts of the city

2034
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,719
I guess that all of you have

2035
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:24,840
some kinds of ideas what could it be

2036
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:27,060
about like what kind of explanations

2037
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:30,139
with Uber why is it that rich and poor

2038
01:43:30,139 --> 01:43:32,540
black and white

2039
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:36,840
Hispanic Asian people of

2040
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,239
virgin people of a different class that

2041
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:41,100
they live in a different part of the

2042
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:42,179
city

2043
01:43:42,179 --> 01:43:44,940
why is that

2044
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:48,300
example when it comes inspiration or

2045
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,800
incoming

2046
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,980
City they will often just choose the the

2047
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,679
neighborhood

2048
01:43:54,679 --> 01:43:57,840
agency something that helps them find

2049
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,260
work

2050
01:44:02,219 --> 01:44:05,000
system

2051
01:44:05,219 --> 01:44:07,820
around

2052
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:11,000
for the country

2053
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,900
same language

2054
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:22,100
supermarkets or other services that are

2055
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:24,360
created for the purpose of this

2056
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,900
International

2057
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:29,699
you have another explanation

2058
01:44:29,699 --> 01:44:33,780
I mean uh probably the difference in the

2059
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:36,560
house and choices

2060
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:41,719
for example infrastructure uh

2061
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,960
okay so it could be about what you're

2062
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:48,480
able to afford and the financial limits

2063
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,980
that you have it could be about the

2064
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:54,480
choice to live amongst people like you

2065
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,739
as possible

2066
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:09,619
they said that some agents don't

2067
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:15,540
know okay

2068
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:20,040
okay

2069
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:21,420
um yeah

2070
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:23,580
um there are many there are many

2071
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:26,340
explanations and it is it is

2072
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:29,040
uh what is important for me that I'm

2073
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,500
going to try to do in a very short

2074
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:34,080
period of time is to run through a

2075
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,960
couple of typical explanations but I

2076
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,760
find important is and that's why I'm

2077
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,440
showing you this graph I think you've

2078
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:43,040
seen it already in some of the previous

2079
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:46,860
classes about Professor crosses

2080
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:48,960
um so what is important for me is that

2081
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,659
different geographers or

2082
01:45:51,659 --> 01:45:54,780
Urban thinkers or people working in the

2083
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:56,460
domain of perfect Studies have been

2084
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,159
coming up with different explanations

2085
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:01,440
that have often it matters very much

2086
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,900
from which sub-discipline

2087
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:06,840
that you're looking at and so feminist

2088
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,440
geographers have been

2089
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:13,159
pointing at different explanations of

2090
01:46:13,159 --> 01:46:17,880
segregation then Marxist geographers

2091
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:22,020
yeah so for that reason it is important

2092
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,480
to situate these theories to explain

2093
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,520
segregation

2094
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:29,639
on this match and my take on it is that

2095
01:46:29,639 --> 01:46:31,619
one explanation is not better than the

2096
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:33,960
other but in order to understand what is

2097
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:36,119
happening we need to look at potential

2098
01:46:36,119 --> 01:46:39,300
limits of people and Marxist will have a

2099
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,880
big theory about it and but also a

2100
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:42,840
choice

2101
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:46,280
and it will be mostly these

2102
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:49,159
days

2103
01:46:49,159 --> 01:46:52,440
who are eager to explore the preferences

2104
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,400
of people

2105
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,280
and why people want to live in a

2106
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,840
particular neighborhood and they will

2107
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:58,860
also then

2108
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:01,080
go to interview escape with people why

2109
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,780
is it that you move

2110
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:05,639
and so my point is I think it's

2111
01:47:05,639 --> 01:47:07,560
important that you

2112
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:10,260
unravel these different theories made up

2113
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:11,699
by these different thinkers from

2114
01:47:11,699 --> 01:47:15,000
different disciplines

2115
01:47:15,239 --> 01:47:19,139
um quantitative geographers in the 60s

2116
01:47:19,139 --> 01:47:21,480
were not so interested explanations of

2117
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:24,420
segregation but they had a rich set of

2118
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,719
mapping tools to understand these

2119
01:47:27,719 --> 01:47:29,340
spatial patterns

2120
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,380
but they were not so interested in

2121
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,060
explanations

2122
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:37,260
ecological models Burgers she would go

2123
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:40,380
and read Burgess 1925 concentric zone

2124
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:42,540
model why do these different population

2125
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,940
groups can look in different parts of

2126
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:47,400
the city almost like you would have

2127
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:50,100
these Pioneer of vegetations right

2128
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:52,860
imagine a mute area of land first you

2129
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:55,619
will find grass and then you would find

2130
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:58,619
shrips and as the shrubs grow the grass

2131
01:47:58,619 --> 01:48:00,239
cannot survive anymore because there's

2132
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,179
no lighting

2133
01:48:02,179 --> 01:48:04,739
for the for the grass and then you would

2134
01:48:04,739 --> 01:48:06,659
get these big trees and these shrubs can

2135
01:48:06,659 --> 01:48:09,960
also not survive so you would have

2136
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:13,080
competition amongst different types of

2137
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:14,580
vegetation you could have competition

2138
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:16,500
amongst different populations

2139
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:19,560
you would have Invasion the most desired

2140
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:22,619
parts so we talk about ecological models

2141
01:48:22,619 --> 01:48:25,920
because when you read these

2142
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,560
um 100 year old theories that often you

2143
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,560
find these analogies with

2144
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,960
um ecological models

2145
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,960
for vegetation

2146
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:40,760
or the survival the fittest

2147
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:44,100
so ecological models they draw on

2148
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:46,520
theories of expansion competition

2149
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,600
Invasion succession of different

2150
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,159
countries

2151
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:53,460
technology to what you find in among

2152
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:55,320
plants

2153
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,960
for Marxist geographers different

2154
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:01,440
neighborhoods different

2155
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:04,920
build environments are parts of circuits

2156
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:06,060
of capital

2157
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:08,639
and so to understand why different

2158
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:10,560
neighborhoods are produced for different

2159
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,980
people we need to understand the flows

2160
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:16,920
of capital David Harvey would would say

2161
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:19,080
and

2162
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,199
um the circuits in which this built

2163
01:49:22,199 --> 01:49:24,000
environment features

2164
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,880
for instance I'm not going to discuss

2165
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,020
this whole

2166
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:31,800
this whole figure but for example to

2167
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,260
understand

2168
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:37,080
supervisation we also need to understand

2169
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,960
the what they call from the accumulation

2170
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:43,260
regime in which this supervisation came

2171
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:44,280
about

2172
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:47,040
and how for example after the second

2173
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,860
world war in Belgium

2174
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:51,900
supervisation was promoted by the state

2175
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:54,000
also because it was a start of a

2176
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,460
consumption spiral when you suburbanize

2177
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,199
you need a car

2178
01:49:58,199 --> 01:50:01,860
so people will buy more cars you will

2179
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:04,199
need a fridge because this local shop is

2180
01:50:04,199 --> 01:50:06,420
far away you will need a freezer yeah

2181
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:08,280
and so there's a whole consumption

2182
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,860
spiral that starts when people

2183
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:13,199
suburbanize and so in order to

2184
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:15,900
understand why supervisation of the

2185
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:18,000
middle classes was promoted in Belgium

2186
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,460
after the second world war we need to

2187
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:23,100
understand the accumulations regime in

2188
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:26,159
which this functions or

2189
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:29,520
who understands why neighborhoods are

2190
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,679
being gentrified to understand the

2191
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:33,480
landscape because many of you have

2192
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:35,880
pluses by material by clicking and as

2193
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,380
well then he will explain you how this

2194
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:39,000
rant Gap works

2195
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,239
yeah so he tries to understand when you

2196
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:44,340
when you look at gentrification through

2197
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,920
a random perspective and say well the

2198
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,300
fact that you have

2199
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:51,900
an invasion now of gentrifiers to to

2200
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:54,300
borrow this word from Burgers to

2201
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:56,340
understand that you need to understand

2202
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,800
the brand Gap and the fact that profits

2203
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,900
can be made in this neighborhoods so

2204
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:04,020
this is part of capital accumulation so

2205
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,900
radical Marxist geographers will focus

2206
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:09,480
on the fact that you have the rich in

2207
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:12,239
the suburbs or that you have the rich in

2208
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:13,920
this gentrifying neighborhoods they will

2209
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,020
try to understand how that fits within

2210
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:19,199
this process of capital accumulation

2211
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:22,199
better explanation of segregation will

2212
01:51:22,199 --> 01:51:24,360
therefore be rooted in the circuits of

2213
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:28,400
capital that's Harvey with strong

2214
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:31,980
in the text by my campaign you will read

2215
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:34,760
about the Neo Weber which there are more

2216
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:37,500
constraints to people than only these

2217
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,420
Financial constraints

2218
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:42,000
it's also about discrimination it's

2219
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,860
about the social capital when you have

2220
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:46,020
how you hear about houses that

2221
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:49,139
production etc etc and so you will read

2222
01:51:49,139 --> 01:51:51,540
about these different

2223
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:53,820
um resources that might be important in

2224
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:55,199
finding that way

2225
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:58,320
and then also the constraints that link

2226
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,900
to that

2227
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:03,080
what you have there at the bottom is

2228
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:06,480
discrimination by uh people in the real

2229
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,619
estate business

2230
01:52:07,619 --> 01:52:10,380
for different population groups in

2231
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:13,619
Belgium you see that there are some

2232
01:52:13,619 --> 01:52:16,580
significance

2233
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,260
numbers

2234
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:21,300
so it's not only about the financial

2235
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:23,880
resources it's also about your last name

2236
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,040
and whether that's Dutch or French or

2237
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,619
whether that is an Arabic name that will

2238
01:52:28,619 --> 01:52:31,199
impact upon how easy it is for you to

2239
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:34,260
find an apartment or a place to buy in

2240
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:37,400
in Belgium

2241
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:40,440
behavioral geographers they are

2242
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,659
interested in the preferences

2243
01:52:42,659 --> 01:52:44,940
and the perceptions and the

2244
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:48,300
decision-making of individual so for

2245
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:50,420
them to explain

2246
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:52,860
supervisations and the fact that these

2247
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:54,659
middle class families move to the

2248
01:52:54,659 --> 01:52:58,739
suburbs they will think about push and

2249
01:52:58,739 --> 01:53:01,020
pull factors why do these people prefer

2250
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:02,340
to leave the city

2251
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:04,199
it is polluted

2252
01:53:04,199 --> 01:53:07,380
is overcrowded it's you have all the

2253
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:09,739
grind them

2254
01:53:09,739 --> 01:53:13,080
now why are people attracted to the

2255
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:14,760
Circuit so there are different reasons

2256
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:15,540
for them

2257
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:18,320
but in order to understand

2258
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,820
segregation you also need to understand

2259
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:22,980
the preferences of these different

2260
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:25,440
populations it's not only about

2261
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:28,199
restraints

2262
01:53:28,199 --> 01:53:30,360
it's not only about capital accumulation

2263
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:32,699
it's also about different groups of

2264
01:53:32,699 --> 01:53:35,100
people preferring to live in different

2265
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,739
kinds of environments as students will

2266
01:53:37,739 --> 01:53:39,659
also be segregated from non-students

2267
01:53:39,659 --> 01:53:41,639
because we have a certain many of you

2268
01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:43,500
will have a similar set of preferences

2269
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:46,679
that make you not live in the suburbs I

2270
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:48,239
guess but that will make you live closer

2271
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:51,480
to the university and closer to places

2272
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:55,260
where interesting things are happening

2273
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:59,040
and then you also read in this text by

2274
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,159
Ronald

2275
01:54:01,159 --> 01:54:04,440
and you also read about ethnic cultural

2276
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:06,000
if you could also look at these

2277
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,820
preferences through an ethnic lens and

2278
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:10,380
for example

2279
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:12,600
um to explain why

2280
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:17,100
people of Moroccan Turkish origin in the

2281
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:18,840
city of antwer why they live in

2282
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:21,239
particular neighborhoods you will need

2283
01:54:21,239 --> 01:54:23,340
to understand better Financial

2284
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:26,340
restraints many of them would be rather

2285
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:29,900
poor and so they are forced to live in

2286
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:32,820
in key parts of the city or cheaper

2287
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:33,960
parts

2288
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:35,760
but you also need to understand their

2289
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,380
preferences and you can also look at

2290
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:39,719
that through an ethnic lens and many of

2291
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:41,940
these Moroccans will be eager to live

2292
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:44,159
close to a mosque or to his opposed to

2293
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,619
Turkish failure or close to a Halal

2294
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:48,800
Butcher and that makes them

2295
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:51,840
particles it could also look through

2296
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:54,540
these preferences where you could look

2297
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:56,940
at these preferences through an ethnic

2298
01:54:56,940 --> 01:54:58,800
list

2299
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,860
use the same lens to understand why

2300
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,320
more and more these Moroccan families or

2301
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:07,020
people or families of origin also move

2302
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:08,460
to the suburbs

2303
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:10,699
there will might also be

2304
01:55:10,699 --> 01:55:14,820
a preference really to ethnicity for

2305
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:16,679
example

2306
01:55:16,679 --> 01:55:19,800
um who studied this in the answer

2307
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:22,260
context found out already quite some

2308
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:24,179
time ago but

2309
01:55:24,179 --> 01:55:26,639
in these ethnic neighborhoods as there

2310
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,260
are also being called you also have very

2311
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:30,600
tight networks of social control

2312
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:33,119
so to move out of these neighborhoods is

2313
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:36,659
also too out of this to move away from

2314
01:55:36,659 --> 01:55:38,820
the social control in these areas so you

2315
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:40,980
could have another preference that is

2316
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,960
linked to this definition

2317
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:47,400
um so the ethnic cultural approach where

2318
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:49,380
you look at these preferences through an

2319
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:52,860
ethnic lens and obviously it can also be

2320
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:55,500
criticized

2321
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,600
both modern geographers they will try to

2322
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:01,580
understand how housing is important in

2323
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:04,639
identity kind of ways in which you

2324
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:07,800
conceptualize yourself and the meaning

2325
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:09,960
that housing or living in a particular

2326
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,600
part of the city gives to you so you see

2327
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,840
here a book entitled the platform the

2328
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,100
meaning of house

2329
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:20,580
and housing is more than just a roof

2330
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:23,580
above your head it's also about boom and

2331
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:25,440
feeling at home

2332
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,900
and so this post post-modern geographers

2333
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:29,880
they try to understand segregation from

2334
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:32,159
this lens and so they try to understand

2335
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:36,960
what moving to the suburbs means or

2336
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,820
these middle class people who did that

2337
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:40,260
in this

2338
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:42,239
was the thing to do if you had the money

2339
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,820
you're reading the quote well let me

2340
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:47,760
move to the suburbs and so this idea of

2341
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,440
social Mobility

2342
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:53,760
and showing off somehow was quite

2343
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,219
important in understanding why this

2344
01:56:56,219 --> 01:56:59,520
group of people moved to the suburbs and

2345
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,159
we can do the same for

2346
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:03,360
um

2347
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:07,139
for for why these gentrifiers

2348
01:57:07,139 --> 01:57:09,659
to move back is often set into the

2349
01:57:09,659 --> 01:57:12,860
cities it will also be about a certain

2350
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:15,860
identity and

2351
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:20,040
about how that gives meaning to to their

2352
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,340
ideas and how they understand themselves

2353
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:25,920
in comparison with others who then

2354
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:29,360
living foreign

2355
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:48,420
on these pictures

2356
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:50,880
and to get them to live in the city

2357
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:53,520
because it helps them

2358
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,980
um to to have a tech space

2359
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:58,739
yeah so if you want to have money to

2360
01:57:58,739 --> 01:58:00,900
spend in a city you will need in the

2361
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:05,520
building system you will eat and

2362
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:10,739
in the City

2363
01:58:10,739 --> 01:58:14,300
now the city council can

2364
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:17,520
I I I'm not really making myself very

2365
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,320
clear but the bottom line is that it's

2366
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:20,820
postmodern geographers decided to

2367
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:23,460
understand why people end up in

2368
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:25,440
different parts of the city through the

2369
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:29,639
lens of identity and how we identify as

2370
01:58:29,639 --> 01:58:31,980
people with the place where we live and

2371
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,840
what that means for how we look at

2372
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,719
ourselves and others looking in other

2373
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:40,699
parts of the city foreign

2374
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,659
[Music]

2375
01:59:12,659 --> 01:59:15,119
so I could give you another exam

2376
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:17,699
question like look at this map here the

2377
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:19,920
distribution of people of Turkish and

2378
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,500
Moroccan origin and answer how would

2379
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:25,500
these different geographers explain it

2380
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,480
and many of the explanations that you've

2381
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:30,599
given in the beginning of

2382
01:59:30,599 --> 01:59:32,760
when I started to talk about the course

2383
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:35,340
of segregation have been studied by

2384
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:36,719
these different

2385
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:38,820
a geographers working in some

2386
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:41,159
disciplines or people in different parts

2387
01:59:41,159 --> 01:59:44,639
of what extent called Urban studies

2388
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:48,420
yeah of course why do we do that is

2389
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:51,179
because we assume that this matters and

2390
01:59:51,179 --> 01:59:53,580
that segregation has effects and has

2391
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:54,840
consequences

2392
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:58,820
that many that people have been

2393
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:01,560
eager to understand what does it mean

2394
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:03,780
for a poor person to live in a

2395
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,820
neighborhood that is smart Bible I mean

2396
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:08,219
most of the other poor people living

2397
02:00:08,219 --> 02:00:10,199
around it does it matter whether you

2398
02:00:10,199 --> 02:00:11,639
live in that kind of neighborhoods or

2399
02:00:11,639 --> 02:00:13,500
whether you as a person you've been a

2400
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:17,960
more mixtape and yet Miller classes

2401
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:20,760
yeah or does it matter for a city

2402
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:23,699
and when you have this segregation of

2403
02:00:23,699 --> 02:00:25,980
blacks living in a particular part of

2404
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:27,719
the city and then why it's taking a

2405
02:00:27,719 --> 02:00:29,040
different Gap

2406
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,320
or would it be better to strive for this

2407
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:34,619
kind of more even distribution of uh of

2408
02:00:34,619 --> 02:00:36,719
blacks and whites in a particular City

2409
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:41,699
or rich and poor or uh young people and

2410
02:00:41,699 --> 02:00:46,639
old people whatever social categories

2411
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:49,080
so next week

2412
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,000
I will not discuss patterns of

2413
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,060
segregation causes of segregation but I

2414
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:57,119
will discuss these effects

2415
02:00:57,119 --> 02:01:00,239
and also policies of social mixing that

2416
02:01:00,239 --> 02:01:03,000
are related so then we get to the heart

2417
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,960
of why does it matter to to study this

2418
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,960
um well is because we assume that

2419
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,719
segregation of concentration

2420
02:01:11,719 --> 02:01:14,940
centralization that is at all ethics for

2421
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:16,560
the people that we have been talking

2422
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:19,500
about for these two hours

2423
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:22,080
so in two weeks time

2424
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:24,000
another class on the effects of

2425
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,280
segregation next week

2426
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:27,719
Tuesday

2427
02:01:27,719 --> 02:01:29,760
field trip to Antwerp where we will ask

2428
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:30,540
us

2429
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:33,480
on the field many of these issues as

2430
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:36,420
well so I look forward to see many of

2431
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:38,219
you in answer

2432
02:01:38,219 --> 02:01:41,900
Tuesday eight something in the in the

2433
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,679
railway station

2434
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:45,780
so see you soon

2435
02:01:45,780 --> 02:01:48,679
thank you

2436
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:52,400
[Music]

2437
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:55,400
thank you



# 5 Neighbourhood effects and living with diversity

1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,200
yes

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:10,320
I've done my best now to restart the

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,179
stream

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,920
maybe you can ask whether it's it's

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,279
working it's difficult for me to check

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,960
I thought I had been doing what I've

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
been doing last week it seemed to work

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,840
then

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,199
but um also for those who use the

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,660
streams to to study

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,420
I think it makes more sense to use last

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,020
year's stream also for today's lecture

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,579
for those who are following now because

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,340
I I prefer to teach for the ones here

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,399
meaning that I will be in front of my

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,910
screen I should also put that on again

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,840
[Music]

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,559
um

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,260
or in between in the classroom and that

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,539
will not be recorded and last year I've

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,579
just been streaming from my office

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,260
because we were not

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,020
supposed to have lectures anymore so I

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,760
feel that it's better to

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,520
for all the last year's team and also

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,979
for the ones who can't be here today but

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,500
also in case you want to study the

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,460
slides are 1990 99 the same

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,220
so um I think it makes more sense to use

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,340
last year's live stream also for last

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,400
week's class

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,380
thank you

33
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,299
um

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,280
do you have any information about the

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,759
stream now

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,259
you think it's working

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,740
okay and I'll I'll do my best to

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,400
move it in that direction

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
um

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,820
okay so let's suppose that the stream is

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,740
working

42
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,740
if not everyone can rely on last year's

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,600
team

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,340
um

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,560
okay I think quite many of you are here

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,299
like I don't know how many students have

47
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,640
expected to have I think 70 or 80

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,540
percent this year

49
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,060
um could the ideal of social mix so I I

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,600
told you already I told you already that

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,360
in many cities across the world there

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,819
has been a concern with segregation it

53
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,640
has been supposed that segregation has

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
negative effects

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
on uh poor people for example and that

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,379
you're worse off when you're poor when

57
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,780
you're living in a neighborhood where

58
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,080
with a concentration of poverty

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,660
rather than in a mixed neighborhood

60
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,660
where you have both Working Class People

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,800
and another philosophy

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,980
um already in the 19th century in the

63
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,239
hey days of the Industrial Revolution

64
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,239
um you have very different groups

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,819
um the capitalistic bourgeoisie and the

66
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,400
utopian socialists yeah so both the

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,519
Bourgeois and the Socialists who were

68
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,080
afraid

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,080
or who were thinking that

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,840
um concentrations of laborers in

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,540
particular neighborhoods of the city for

72
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,580
example here in Brussels in modern Bay

73
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,400
at that time or an antwer in um and for

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,440
the good house but this would have

75
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,659
negative effects

76
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,140
and the bourgeoisie was afraid that

77
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,959
concentrations of laborers might lead to

78
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
Revolutions

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
that socialist thinking would become

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,319
dominant with these neighborhoods and

81
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,940
that you would never report that people

82
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,360
would get on the streets okay and the

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,080
utopian socialists they were scared that

84
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,620
um

85
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,760
this these concentrations of laborers

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,540
would

87
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,879
um make it more difficult to strive for

88
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,980
an egalitarian society

89
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,680
and so on both ends of the political

90
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,360
Spectrum you had people who were

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,760
thinking that in places such as

92
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,799
Manchester or ginto Brussels where you

93
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,319
have these new uh working class

94
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,200
neighborhoods that this was something

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,739
bad to be counteracted

96
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,900
this ideal is still very dominant

97
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,280
nowadays

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,799
and here you see a quote

99
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,110
from

100
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,560
[Music]

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,858
well the Brussels Capital Region quite

102
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,500
an old one but I think current policy

103
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,320
documents you would find similar quotes

104
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,120
stating that contrary to the American

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,180
city the ideal type for the European

106
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,419
city is based on a mix of functions and

107
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,500
people

108
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,240
I think it's important to make a

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,639
distinction between these two things on

110
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,919
the one hand they refer to a functional

111
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,759
mix meaning that they would like to

112
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,560
strive for neighborhoods where you have

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,900
a mix of the residential function

114
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,720
apartments and houses

115
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,220
and for example offices

116
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,340
or shops saying that well it's not good

117
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,040
to have neighborhoods where you only

118
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,060
have

119
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,460
a residential friction and other

120
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,020
neighborhoods where you only have

121
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,699
offices

122
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,060
and so we strive for

123
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,620
Brussels with neighborhoods where you

124
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,900
have a functional mix

125
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,000
yeah but then the other thing this is

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,820
what we are interested in today is

127
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,660
saying well we also want Brussels like

128
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,000
other European cities to have

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,660
neighborhoods with a mix of people poor

130
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,360
people and rich people

131
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,039
and in Brussels there have been many

132
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,060
different moments where this

133
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,759
this topic of social mix has been

134
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,080
agenda

135
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,840
I think those of you

136
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,780
have not arrive to vessels only a month

137
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,360
ago I might have heard of these

138
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,820
discussions around Creator books the

139
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,740
social housing Estates on my list

140
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,120
so in the periphery of the Brussels

141
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,419
Capital Region and therefore yeah quite

142
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,720
some media reports about crime

143
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,060
yeah and then the issue of well you have

144
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,500
all these

145
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,060
to be

146
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,639
accommodated on the social housing

147
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,160
estate in uh in Brussels and in Belgium

148
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,340
more generally you need to fall below a

149
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,500
certain income

150
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,039
stressful yeah meaning that it's mainly

151
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,860
the poorest of the poor that you will

152
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,720
concentrate on these social housing

153
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,120
instance

154
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,280
and so then you had discussions well is

155
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,639
that a good thing is this not leading to

156
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,240
this culture where crime is uh or common

157
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,660
and conservative politicians would raise

158
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,520
this kind of dog service

159
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,440
Progressive politicians would wonder

160
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,919
well is that then a neighborhood where

161
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,319
it is easy for poor people to climb the

162
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,380
social network wouldn't it be easier to

163
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,259
be socially mobile when you are not only

164
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,500
surrounded by other poor people but when

165
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,680
you are living between poor and rich

166
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,160
people alive

167
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,680
a neighborhood in underlift and

168
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,620
obviously also in the wake of these

169
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,639
terrorist attacks in 2015 there were a

170
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,039
lot of concerns also in the

171
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,360
international league

172
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
about more of me and there were reports

173
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,000
about more than make as difficult as a

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,139
ghetto

175
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,199
it's been looking at the statistics

176
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,120
I think

177
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,060
is the municipality most

178
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,680
people of Moroccan and origin the

179
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,620
boost followers of Islam but it's still

180
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,419
less than half

181
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,180
so in the in international media it was

182
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,300
often reported as this model made was a

183
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
municipality with only

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
uh

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,599
Moroccan

186
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,900
people and people of Moroccan Origins

187
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,759
and when you look at the statistics that

188
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,919
was not the case nonetheless

189
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,220
they were concerns hopefully but also

190
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,080
conditionally

191
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,759
um about mobile Bank being a safe haven

192
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,919
for terrorists and breeding graph or

193
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,639
there

194
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,580
are affected you have this concentration

195
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,640
of people of the same origin was

196
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,599
then the reason to be to be concerned

197
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,200
so both when it comes social Mobility

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,539
and when it comes to

199
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,920
cultural integration and newcomers there

200
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,040
are concerns in a city such as Brussels

201
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,459
about the concentration of either people

202
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,940
or people of foreign origin these are

203
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,480
two different issues social mobility and

204
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,959
social cultural integration and so I

205
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,920
hint was there a question

206
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
um

207
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,440
no I am I'm trying to explain you

208
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,600
I'm not saying that there is that these

209
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,240
are examples one is the social picks but

210
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,100
I'm trying to explain you that in many

211
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,200
cities across the roads and I will start

212
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,779
from a couple of religion examples this

213
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,000
ideal or social mix is high on the

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,279
political object and I'm referring to

215
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,519
this paper boss issue and modern-day

216
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,500
after the pillars the text has two

217
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,080
moments where social mixtures highly

218
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,080
debated local media and in the case of

219
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,700
these terrorist attacks also is

220
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,940
international

221
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,080
um Brussels we moved to Ghent

222
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,540
and a former colleague of mine

223
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,519
has written a nice book about

224
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,940
gentrification

225
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,040
his name is

226
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,720
so for those who know the Dutch who are

227
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,360
interested in a piece of things they

228
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,220
they find some interesting literature

229
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,940
there

230
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,880
and you see a quote from an elder man of

231
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,440
the City of Kent

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
uh talking about for those who know

233
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,360
neighborhoods such as Bridge support

234
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,560
neighborhoods that have a similar

235
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,640
history

236
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,000
as modern big in Brussels or

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,680
um

238
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,200
in Antwerp neighborhoods that have

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,800
developed in this 19th century

240
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,620
industrial industrialization

241
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,000
and

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,240
um so neighborhoods with

243
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,740
um

244
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,500
higher than average percentage of

245
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,899
unemployment higher than average

246
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,899
percentage of people also a higher than

247
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,680
average percentage of people of foreign

248
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,740
what was this elder man saying well when

249
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,220
I attract young families

250
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,740
preferably with a job preferably double

251
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,339
income families that will improve my

252
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,600
social tissue

253
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,060
my textbooks and my neighborhood life

254
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,399
I think these are different concerns the

255
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,839
tech space

256
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,360
is something something important I'm

257
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,360
sorry I'm in Belgium about 40 to 50

258
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,540
percent of the municipal budget comes

259
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,720
from local Texas most of it is a

260
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,420
percentage on the local income tax and

261
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,519
percentage on the

262
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,579
um on the income tax meaning that if you

263
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,860
have more rich people in your

264
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,800
municipality that you will have a higher

265
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,700
Municipal budget

266
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,800
and the other part comes from lent and

267
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,720
house value

268
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,300
um but so why does this elder man again

269
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,420
find or that attract young families

270
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,399
preferably with a joke

271
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,940
middle class of the white families is to

272
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,399
improve this local Tech space to have

273
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,019
more budget for the city of cats but on

274
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,700
top of that

275
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,920
he's saying it's also important to

276
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,240
improve my social tissue and I will go

277
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,540
further into that but often there the

278
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,060
underlying thought is that for example

279
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,060
when you have rich and poor people then

280
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,140
you have

281
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,540
families with the job and families

282
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,820
without a job that you will get diverse

283
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,640
social networks for example and then in

284
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,579
these networks jobs can be found or

285
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,220
people can be helped with homework Etc

286
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,399
and so this

287
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,160
ID for the importance to attract young

288
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,220
families prefer preferably connections

289
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,060
it's not only for to improved Tech space

290
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,060
of the city but also to improve the

291
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,920
social tissue and neighborhood life

292
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,920
in very much a similar way and we moved

293
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,800
to the city of Antwerp and we have been

294
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,579
visiting this undcredible port

295
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,079
neighborhoods the neighborhood where I

296
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,380
think 25 of the newcomers in Antwerp

297
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,500
passed through before moving to other

298
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,360
parts of the city and neighborhood that

299
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,579
is quite similar to this transition zone

300
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,399
that Burgess was describing in 19th

301
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,380
century Chicago

302
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,540
and I've been talking there about a lot

303
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,800
of regulations

304
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,459
and then affected shopkeepers in the

305
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,820
neighborhood but also

306
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,060
regulations that concern the subdivision

307
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,860
of houses

308
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,760
and you see there that in the previous

309
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,639
governance agreement in Antwerp it was

310
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,459
stated that the city wants a larger

311
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,000
share of single-family dwellings in this

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,339
particular neighborhood in the housing

313
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,000
Supply in order to attract families I

314
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,399
always find it interesting to see this

315
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,220
kind of words often youngsters means

316
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,700
young people or foreigners what you see

317
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,860
here is that families is used to call

318
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,180
this mantis

319
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,200
double income families often wide

320
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,300
structures so that is why the

321
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,220
transformation of single-family

322
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,279
dwellings into smaller housing entities

323
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,040
is not desirable and for those who join

324
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,320
to enter we have been discussing how

325
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,959
could you support the arrival function

326
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,480
in this neighborhood well when people

327
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,579
are looking for a very cheap place to

328
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,220
live and they will rent a room for even

329
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,079
just a mattress

330
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,000
and that's what they look for the

331
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,120
cheapest roof above their heads what you

332
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,639
see here is that the city of Antwerp is

333
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,160
not supporting the Bible version but

334
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,360
finds it important to bring another kind

335
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,500
of people uh to this neighborhood namely

336
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,480
richer families

337
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,180
so again you see efforts here

338
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,680
to

339
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,940
um

340
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,940
to earn this unto elephant North into a

341
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,740
socially mixed neighborhood where you

342
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,959
have newcomers next to uh white families

343
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,480
who can afford

344
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,019
to buy such a big house

345
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,139
just for for the use of one of one

346
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,320
family

347
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,300
in the art in the article by Tom Slater

348
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,779
and you've also seen references to

349
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,180
the situation in the UK

350
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,420
and the United States and and he refers

351
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,860
to this housing market renewal projects

352
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,720
where

353
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,420
um different in different parts of the

354
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,639
country

355
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,680
neighborhoods which were mainly

356
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,160
inhabited by poor people often poor

357
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,500
people of foreign origin you had

358
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,380
demolition projects and you had the

359
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,980
creation of new dwellings that tried to

360
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,600
cater for different audiences

361
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,760
and again you see the

362
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,120
this is a quote from the artist later

363
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,959
you see that the ID was that

364
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,980
um in these neighborhoods that have been

365
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,220
transformed uh that the inhabitants the

366
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,740
people who used to live there were

367
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,320
seriously disadvantaged by where they

368
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,680
lived and the idea was that living in

369
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,560
such a neighborhood being poor in such a

370
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,660
neighborhood

371
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,259
accessor based poverty makes it worse

372
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,180
about basically living in such a

373
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,339
neighborhood is worse than living in

374
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,480
another name

375
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,759
and that it will be more difficult to

376
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,040
find out of poverty in such a

377
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,100
neighborhood other parts of the city so

378
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,480
for this reason I was a big problem and

379
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,020
project to basically demolish much of

380
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,419
the housing in these neighborhoods and

381
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,540
to build new houses that catered for

382
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,500
different audiences

383
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,040
um Slater also refers to this hope six

384
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,520
program in the UK and the U.S sorry

385
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,059
for example Cabrini Green a neighborhood

386
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,760
a couple of miles to the north of the

387
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,820
loop in Chicago last week I've been

388
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,400
talking quite a bit about Chicago a

389
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,380
neighborhood with a very bad reputation

390
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,539
for drug use

391
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,020
and many crime and many other things

392
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,960
and again what has been done there is

393
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,640
that many of these

394
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,820
apartment books have been torn down have

395
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,539
been demolished and that

396
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,120
you houses have been built again trying

397
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,640
to cater for another kind of it's trying

398
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,460
to bring the middle class to a

399
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,860
neighborhood that was previously mainly

400
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,380
inhabited

401
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,559
and then in the separation of the PS you

402
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,299
might have heard of this function system

403
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,600
where many of the original residents of

404
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,460
the neighborhood such as that brother

405
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,700
voucher and basically to give them a

406
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,140
discount on

407
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,860
their parents price in other parts of

408
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,440
the city trying to encourage them to

409
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,500
move to better off

410
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,039
neighborhoods in other parts of Chicago

411
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,220
so again you see attempts to mix

412
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,380
neighborhoods

413
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,559
in the conviction that the concentration

414
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,580
of poverty is bad that it leads to crime

415
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,000
and it leads to drug use and that it is

416
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,840
bad for these inhabitants

417
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,580
South Africa

418
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,880
yeah

419
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,980
well I think the outcome

420
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,580
um

421
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,740
there are many many papers about this

422
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,960
and many scholars are looking at

423
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,780
different sites of this metal

424
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,860
but

425
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,580
um

426
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,520
I think in the article by Tom Slater and

427
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,679
page

428
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,039
369 I see here it is stated that No

429
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,500
Effects have been reported for a number

430
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,240
of outcomes

431
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
and that adverse effects on the delete

432
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
delinquency

433
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,919
and physical health of

434
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,679
um adolescent males in particular have

435
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,000
been reported

436
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,520
um but positive effects on adult mental

437
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,679
health and education and health of young

438
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,440
women so it depends very much

439
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,059
what you're looking at

440
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,919
but in any case

441
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,380
studies who tried and to find out like

442
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,720
what happened to the people who moved to

443
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,539
middle class neighborhoods and found

444
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,780
fairly adverse effects and in any case

445
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,020
one good question whether such a

446
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,260
well because the

447
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,120
project

448
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,720
was the best one to try and improve the

449
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,480
situation of poor people in Chicago

450
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,340
yeah

451
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,559
I will discuss the the effects of such

452
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,080
programs in more detail but before doing

453
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,240
that I wanted to highlight that in many

454
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,360
countries across the world us UK many

455
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,679
Belgian cities

456
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,860
and basically all over Western Europe in

457
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,500
South Africa

458
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,360
attends have been made to create

459
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,340
socially mixed neighborhoods in the

460
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,100
conviction that's a segregation as a

461
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,039
concentration of poverty is bad for

462
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,919
people living in uh

463
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,340
foreign

464
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,919
[Music]

465
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,980
of projects that you see here are about

466
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,140
bringing the middle class to

467
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,260
neighborhoods which used to be uh

468
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,919
predominantly predominantly

469
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,000
dysfunction program that I was just

470
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
talking about is also doing the other

471
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,320
way in doing it the other way around

472
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,679
because it tries to bring poor people

473
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,679
um to middle class neighborhoods so this

474
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,140
is also a project where

475
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,419
middle class neighborhoods are also

476
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,520
becoming more more mixed

477
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,740
because by giving these rent subsidies

478
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,240
through this voucher system it allows

479
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,799
people

480
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,240
underprivileged people to move to a

481
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,600
better of parts of the city as well

482
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,059
but I will I will come back to that

483
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:03,659
um

484
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,400
for now

485
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,960
well

486
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,539
we it's good that you already started

487
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,280
wondering about every

488
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,419
ethical difference

489
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,640
but as I said for now it's it's

490
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,799
important that you see that

491
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,080
in many parts in many corners of the

492
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,760
world this

493
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,600
um ideal of socially mixed socially

494
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,080
mixed neighborhoods seems to be a very

495
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,919
stable kind of idea

496
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,559
and it's very predominant among policy

497
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,460
makers both on the left and on the right

498
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,320
so on both ends of the political

499
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,360
Spectrum you find this pretty poor

500
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,820
neighborhoods that house people of

501
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,419
different origins or people of different

502
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,820
socio-economic efforts

503
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,100
two questions we need to ask about this

504
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,760
is it possible then to create social

505
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,120
indexed mixed neighborhoods and then

506
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,520
third and is it or second the second

507
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,340
question is it a desirable to do that

508
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,140
and

509
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,740
the article white illustrator gives or

510
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,559
turns later gives in this article a very

511
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,940
clear answer

512
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,120
referring to this whole six

513
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,960
program in the United States and housing

514
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,320
markets renewal in the UK is stating

515
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,940
that what have they done they have

516
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,919
basically just shifted over the

517
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,740
elsewhere this has not been a remedy to

518
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,140
Poverty this has just made poor people

519
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,380
elsewhere in the city

520
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,460
the mode of production that shapes Urban

521
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,020
environments which we live

522
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,659
it's referring to the capitalistic

523
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,260
system there the system of the the mode

524
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,919
of production of capitalism

525
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
produces concentrations of poverty that

526
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,760
many

527
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,780
policy makers as we have seen rejoice in

528
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,840
breaking up yet that same mode of

529
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,620
production churning intact produces

530
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,500
further concentrations just down the

531
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,280
street

532
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,179
I still remember one of my former

533
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,580
professors saying that well many of

534
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,280
these attempts to create socially mixed

535
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,100
neighborhoods by attracting middle class

536
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,440
people

537
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,000
to

538
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,400
for example poor neighborhoods

539
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,500
in Brussels has just shifted this

540
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,340
poverty elsewhere and for that reason he

541
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,360
um

542
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,840
he made this comparison with moving

543
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,179
chairs on the deck of the Titanic people

544
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:51,059
remain poor that you just make them move

545
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,260
somewhere else but this does not

546
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,880
improve their socio-economic position

547
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,820
this does not help them to climb to

548
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,760
social media in in the text 5 and again

549
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,220
all you've also also seen this reference

550
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,260
to water but

551
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,100
oops

552
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,840
so when you look at that

553
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,419
um it it seems to be very hard to create

554
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,100
a social mix

555
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,460
yeah the same goes for Brussels I've

556
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,000
been referring to this article by

557
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,580
material by clicking already in chapter

558
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,799
one

559
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,919
um and basically what mature has been

560
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,580
doing is to study people moving out of

561
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,860
gentrifying neighborhoods in bristles

562
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,640
what happens to people who move out of

563
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,039
neighborhoods in Brussels that are

564
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,140
gentrified

565
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,360
and basically he made a distinction

566
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,900
between different clusters of people and

567
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,659
if I'm correct then cluster one

568
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,059
consisted mainly of Highly Educated

569
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,000
young professionals where do they move

570
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,520
as neighborhoods in Brussels gentrified

571
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,559
they move to Antwerp and Yash and also

572
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,559
some of the municipalities of rabba one

573
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,559
law and these are municipalities

574
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,080
these people find a joke in another city

575
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,720
in another part of Belgium they move out

576
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,580
of this gentrifying neighborhoods and

577
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,419
they

578
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,940
move to a place closer to the place

579
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,880
where they cook and that's where it is

580
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,500
cluster two

581
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,039
consisted of more working philosophy

582
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,700
last people with a lower than average

583
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,980
income where do they move

584
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,679
first of all to

585
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,120
um

586
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,260
well municipalities along the canal

587
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,740
and such as Holland and hillford

588
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,200
I don't know how familiar all of you are

589
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,240
with the geography of Belgium already

590
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,000
but these are also municipalities small

591
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,340
towns that have gone through a process

592
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,380
of industrialization and where you will

593
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,960
find small houses that will be cheaper

594
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,539
than the houses you would find in these

595
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,240
gentrified team records in Brussels yeah

596
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,120
so what you see here is that

597
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,340
gentrification comes with displacement

598
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,039
for example through a municipality such

599
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,820
as Villanova

600
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,559
but as you see these clusters you can

601
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,559
find rather far from Brussels

602
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,240
many

603
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,980
towns cities in this 19th century built

604
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,380
of industrialization in person in

605
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,960
Belgium so these are municipalities

606
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,500
where you would find housing or a rather

607
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,419
cheap price

608
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,179
yeah so if you follow material by

609
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,580
clicking his arguments then you would

610
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,580
see well what happens here is that by

611
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,000
trying to improve

612
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,720
the lives of poor people in Brussels

613
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,900
through creating the social mix

614
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,299
attracting the middle class to these

615
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,940
neighborhoods what you see is that these

616
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,220
people move

617
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,960
are displaced to other municipalities

618
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,440
they also have concentrations of poor

619
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,299
people that but they are located in much

620
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,820
worse situations locations when it comes

621
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,520
to finding a job

622
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,279
and so what is happening here this is

623
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,679
Shifting the chairs on the deck of the

624
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,159
Titanic poverty still exists but by

625
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,080
attracting the middle class to some

626
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,179
neighborhoods or Brussels you move

627
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,940
poverty elsewhere

628
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,640
to places where people can afford to

629
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,600
live

630
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,299
and these are

631
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,559
neighborhoods that we have been visiting

632
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,440
in inshallah for example

633
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,740
where buying a house or renting an

634
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,320
apartment will be much cheaper than at

635
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,299
least in in section or some of the other

636
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:12,200
gentrifying parts of Brussels

637
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,480
this map shows something very similar

638
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,580
for Android

639
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,880
those who join to antler might recognize

640
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,120
its first ring the medieval answer the

641
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,360
second ring

642
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,539
19th century industrial antler

643
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,059
um and what it what is not

644
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,059
um

645
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:39,600
visualizes is a synthesis index of this

646
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,520
advantage and you see that in some

647
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,700
neighborhoods there are no big changes

648
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,220
uh in the last years in this index they

649
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,779
are yellow

650
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:50,940
for example Louis ball

651
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,100
social housing Estates that we have

652
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,620
visited remains yellow situation there

653
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,480
does not really change

654
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,360
you also see other parts of the city

655
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,000
for example a luncheon

656
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,179
at the area around the museum that we

657
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,340
have been growing up

658
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,520
you see that this is blue yeah and many

659
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,120
of the inner city neighborhoods in

660
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,779
entrepreneurs for example are also blue

661
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,100
yeah

662
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,440
at the same time you see that other

663
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,260
parts of the city for example medicine

664
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,840
outside of this 19th century well that

665
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,659
you see a worsening of the synthesis

666
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:37,740
that's also here through this map you

667
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,440
could see that well some neighborhoods

668
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,600
are attracting or middle class people

669
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,559
but poverty is shifted elsewhere in the

670
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,140
city is moving to other parts of the

671
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,380
urban region and this map is just uh

672
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,480
giving you the situation for the

673
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,179
municipality of the city of Antwerp but

674
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,580
if you would include the whole province

675
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,100
of that or you might see that for

676
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,559
example

677
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,600
for people who know culture

678
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,580
um

679
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,340
the Drupal region

680
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,460
we have display factories factors in the

681
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,980
past that you would see a worsening of

682
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,419
the situation

683
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,659
so we can try to attract middle class

684
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,820
people that's what the city of Ventura

685
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,980
Pacific building you can try to attract

686
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,740
the middle classes back to the city

687
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,159
but this displaces

688
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,440
people from these neighborhoods who

689
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,600
cannot afford to live there anymore so

690
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,260
this moves over the elsewhere

691
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,260
Russian

692
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,299
well I I'm a submitted I don't know all

693
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,880
the applications in this in the specific

694
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,299
index but I guess it will be about

695
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:58,760
average income

696
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,020
unemployment and maybe some other

697
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,539
complicators that say something about

698
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,679
this thing

699
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,059
um but I should have I should have put

700
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,059
so much of what we see here

701
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,640
confirms this ID of Slater when clicking

702
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,740
in that well trying to create a social

703
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,000
mix in some parts of the city will

704
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,360
shift poverty will make poverty move

705
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,240
elsewhere I will create

706
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,360
that's what Slater said will create

707
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,520
other concentrations

708
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,440
of poverty this is just down the street

709
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,059
inshallahua for the case of this

710
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,760
gentrifying neighborhoods Over Us in

711
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,520
bone for This Ginger flying so that's

712
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,640
verb in medicine in government in other

713
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,860
parts of these Urban regions

714
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,600
there are examples in the world where

715
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,700
mixed neighborhoods are being created

716
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,980
but that is only possible

717
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,419
when City councils or governments can

718
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,880
have a serious impact

719
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,659
open

720
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,460
upon who's living in in specific

721
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,200
neighborhoods

722
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,640
um in some parts of the world

723
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,640
um Scholars write about inclusionary

724
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,299
housing or inclusionary zoning

725
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,539
forcing for example real estate

726
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:36,539
developers who develop a high tower full

727
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:37,919
of apartments

728
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,539
to

729
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:40,200
um

730
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,919
dedicates a certain percentage of these

731
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,039
residents residential units to people

732
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,140
who fall below a certain income

733
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,519
threshold

734
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,460
and so you can create

735
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,120
a socially mixed neighborhood

736
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,159
if you force

737
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,679
real estate Developers

738
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,059
to

739
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,380
um

740
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,740
well in in newly built projects

741
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,699
to have a certain percentage of

742
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,739
Apartments of for people of a certain if

743
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,139
they fall below a certain inconsistent

744
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,540
in Antwerp I've been talking about this

745
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,460
caltex neighborhood

746
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,339
this was the length of the port in

747
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:30,540
public hands and so the city council

748
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,500
could also sell this land to Developers

749
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,918
with a lot of conditions and so

750
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,399
developers could buy this lens under the

751
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:46,500
condition that's that they built 25 of

752
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,839
the residential units for social housing

753
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:55,159
15 rent 10 to buy and that they

754
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,099
reserved 50 of the units at affordable

755
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,480
prices

756
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,599
and that was not fairly affordable but

757
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,700
at least you could not ask whatever you

758
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,160
wanted these prices could not Skyrocket

759
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,099
could not ask whatever you wanted for

760
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,280
these residential units and so you could

761
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,800
argue a socially mixed neighborhood has

762
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,160
been developed here almost from scratch

763
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,099
there's all these white blocks that you

764
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,859
see here are new and only the brown ones

765
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,020
existed but that was possible because

766
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,380
the lens was publicly owned and could be

767
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,480
sold to developers under the condition

768
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,240
that they reserved this kind of uh

769
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,339
units for certain categories of people

770
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,000
and then we could look who is able to

771
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,060
rent or buy these units well in the belt

772
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,040
in case you need to fall below a certain

773
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,520
income at thresholds in order to be able

774
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,960
to eligible to be eligible for a social

775
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,980
housing

776
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,380
yeah the same goes for this

777
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,140
affordability

778
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,480
um criteria

779
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,980
um I don't know what how what was the

780
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,099
price exactly but I see here that um you

781
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:14,839
could earn up to 58 000 Euro of family

782
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,119
uh almost 4 000 Euro added for each

783
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,700
additional person so these are quite

784
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,660
uh quite High I think already but the

785
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,700
bottom line is that these developers

786
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,320
could not just build whatever they

787
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,000
wanted

788
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,680
that they needed to meet certain

789
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,660
criteria and that they also needed to

790
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,420
reserve quite a bit of number of units

791
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,640
for people

792
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,700
belong to different income computers

793
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,820
at the lowest income categories social

794
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,420
housing

795
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,020
so associately mixed neighborhoods when

796
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,480
it comes to Green goals yeah when it

797
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,940
comes to poverty and wealth could be

798
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,520
created but that was only possible

799
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,220
because there was a serious intervention

800
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,859
of the city council

801
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:09,359
in in this in Belgium

802
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,060
the the government or public authorities

803
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,940
are not really able to intervene that

804
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,780
much in terms because it's only laser

805
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,000
flop there's six percent of the units

806
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,780
which are social housing in Brussels are

807
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,200
10 and all the rest

808
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,480
um with a couple of exceptions minor

809
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,760
exceptions all the risk is the market

810
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,780
it's either people's own house or people

811
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,500
who rent a house from another office

812
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,599
but there are cities across the world

813
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:45,960
where you have 50 social housing okay

814
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,140
enough for example or Amsterdam is

815
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,040
another city a high percentage

816
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,320
it also means that as a council you can

817
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,260
intervene quite a bit the rule is where

818
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,839
in the Belgian case where

819
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,720
about 90 of the people need to find a

820
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,260
house or accommodation on the market you

821
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,960
will see that attempts to create a

822
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,420
social mix quickly lead to displacement

823
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,940
and quickly lead to concentrations of

824
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,820
poverty elsewhere in uh

825
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,320
particular house mix looks like and how

826
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,980
much facility councils can intervene in

827
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,619
in the house

828
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,619
um

829
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,520
there has been a time when the social

830
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,220
Housing Association sold kind of quite

831
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,420
some units

832
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,700
in any case there's a little bit of

833
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,000
Courage

834
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,540
and this type of models are attractive

835
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,760
for the developers right this question

836
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,820
about like I would think developers are

837
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,160
thinking about profits yeah as long as

838
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,960
they as long as they can still make

839
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,540
profits this is possible

840
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,000
and the same goes for this inclusionary

841
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,060
housing as long as a developer is able

842
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,839
to

843
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,060
make profits then this is awesome

844
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,460
in this case I don't think that the

845
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,380
developer said to pay a lot of money for

846
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,200
the city to get this piece of

847
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,180
them and because they were also asked to

848
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,760
because they had to develop the parts

849
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,619
and the streets

850
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,320
and they had to take there to develop

851
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
this social housing

852
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,119
so the city could have earned much more

853
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,579
money by selling this piece of land for

854
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,440
the highest price to a developer who

855
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,660
wanted to build a Sparkles for the

856
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,300
wealthiest of people that shows to do

857
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,380
things different

858
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,119
and there are many parts of the world

859
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,000
where we have these kind of schemes

860
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,480
hello

861
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,660
um

862
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,160
okay is social mix feasible the answer

863
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,660
is yes

864
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,240
it is feasible it is possible to create

865
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,599
socially mixed neighborhoods but it is

866
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,640
very hard to do that in a situation

867
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,579
where the market rings

868
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,020
because then

869
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,359
trying to attract middle class families

870
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,320
to a poor neighborhood will lead to

871
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,820
displacement of poor families to other

872
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,280
parts of the urban region in this case

873
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,520
that will not happen because you reserve

874
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,320
25 of the neighborhood to people who

875
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,320
fall below the certificate

876
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
and as long as these units are social

877
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,000
housing is 25 will remain there for this

878
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,260
population

879
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,119
and so you

880
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,940
allow

881
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,619
for people to live

882
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,540
in a neighborhood

883
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,099
where

884
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,320
50

885
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,660
belongs to middle class for the upper

886
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,560
middle class at 25 percent

887
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,420
um hope these units goes to very rich

888
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,160
people who can afford to spend one

889
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,820
million euros

890
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,540
another question

891
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,720
and like this could be like

892
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,820
social takes early in this one

893
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,960
particularly

894
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,980
radius area in the city but then

895
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,000
wouldn't this be like our classic

896
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,700
example actually should wear like um

897
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,500
capital is being

898
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,839
for illness because even I mean just

899
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,540
from experiences your housing I don't

900
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,140
know

901
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,619
example usually these are like very

902
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:17,280
up-to-date luxury buildings and um there

903
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,300
are so affordable and social housing

904
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,859
however this then changes

905
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,520
so it might there might be different

906
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,800
but then the general effect would

907
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,700
actually

908
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,140
benefit

909
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,140
development

910
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:44,040
found it not like actually the people

911
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,440
who are living there beforehand and

912
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,980
maybe have to preserve it

913
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,040
um

914
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,940
but I think in this case you talk about

915
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,680
people who lived there we're just

916
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,140
understand already that was not so much

917
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,760
the case here because you only had a

918
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,680
couple of hundreds people you developed

919
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,680
a neighborhood for thousands of people

920
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,839
um it was a neighborhood that was uh

921
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,940
more to related I was not so much

922
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,280
put in this

923
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,520
wouldn't this just be another example of

924
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,520
gentrification

925
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,680
and not really attempting to solve

926
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,520
or trying to

927
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,460
purchases

928
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,900
but like is it it depends how you how

929
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,400
you define it

930
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,920
also you would say gentrification comes

931
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,560
with displacement and displacement would

932
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,800
be an essential part of gentrification

933
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
in this case

934
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,660
there might be a displacement of the

935
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,500
people who lived in these brown houses

936
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,900
and will live there already

937
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,460
before the rest of the neighborhood

938
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,680
before the white parts of the main route

939
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,099
were being constructed

940
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:14,160
but there will not be a displacement in

941
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,240
this 25 units which are either rented

942
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,900
out or sold as social house because you

943
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,339
will need to fall below a certain

944
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:26,700
incompatible in order to buy or rent

945
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,339
these places and no matter what happens

946
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,560
in the rest of the neighborhood as

947
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,119
humans will still remain

948
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,460
reserved for people probably not

949
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,579
income threshold so this is a way to

950
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,160
make sure that this place

951
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,740
even if you buy this kind of

952
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,680
so you will not be able to sell them

953
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,200
and if you rent them out

954
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,000
then this is also under the condition

955
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,500
that fall below the circle

956
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,300
everything else

957
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,040
as this whole area has been gentrified

958
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,839
there has been urban renewal in this

959
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:15,300
whole area so it's only in this very

960
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,579
small part where you they were able to

961
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:21,079
create the social studies

962
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,319
yeah yeah one important thing is the

963
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,300
scale the scale at which we discuss

964
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,940
things that we are talking about a very

965
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,339
small scale the neighborhood of a couple

966
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:34,800
of thousand people but indeed if you

967
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,260
discuss it at a scale of Antwerp then

968
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,200
you would see that this whole area

969
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,079
around this red square that we've just

970
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,420
been talking about has been going

971
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,740
through an improvement of this

972
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,119
disadvantaged index and has been going

973
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,960
through a very very

974
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,599
strong gentrification sorry that's

975
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,280
you're completely just a very fair

976
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,420
cooler I'm sorry but then I'm just

977
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,940
curious how it works here like

978
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,260
um

979
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,520
developers can get

980
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,740
tactics or like benefits from the garden

981
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,420
for providing sir

982
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,920
called public housing because that's how

983
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,060
it works

984
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,579
well I don't know about these these tax

985
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:20,520
rebates but for sure the lens price for

986
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,220
which they were able to acquire this

987
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,380
well the price for which they were able

988
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,339
to

989
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:29,760
buy this piece of land from city council

990
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,720
was much lower than it would have been

991
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,920
just a market with a gate

992
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,319
okay is it is it

993
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,060
yeah yeah more questions

994
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,599
but um I know

995
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:08,220
okay now we move to the next question is

996
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,060
it then good or bad is it desirable to

997
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,760
create such a neighbor now what you say

998
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,339
is that well the kind of shops that you

999
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:18,780
find

1000
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,859
the most dictators for the meats and the

1001
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:26,760
desires of this 75 percent of residents

1002
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,760
and a lot of tourists and visitors who

1003
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,640
like to visit that part of the city

1004
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,740
and so that could be a reason to say

1005
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,140
well it's not desirable to do this

1006
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,839
because these people will not find cheap

1007
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,020
food in the area or the kind of

1008
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,119
a product statement like they would like

1009
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,300
to buy but that shows that we are moving

1010
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,940
to uh the next question

1011
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,440
is social mix uh

1012
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,119
and I guess it would be time for a break

1013
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,119
I'm running a bit behind schedule

1014
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,260
I'm wondering there is a three-hour

1015
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,319
and three hours are dedicated to

1016
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:10,020
urban geography last week I've been

1017
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,380
limiting my last two hours would it be a

1018
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,180
big problem if I would go if it's over

1019
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,280
these two hours of course

1020
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,280
okay I'll I'll just go through the

1021
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,720
slides and

1022
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,720
we'll see we'll see uh what time what

1023
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,640
time but I think it's better to have a

1024
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,980
break now before moving to this next

1025
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,440
question is it desirable create this uh

1026
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,640
five minutes and then we continue

1027
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:55,629
[Music]

1028
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,670
thank you

1029
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,729
[Music]

1030
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,640
very random questions

1031
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,180
thank you

1032
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,520
yes

1033
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,640
thank you

1034
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,920
uh

1035
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,920
questions

1036
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,180
anyways

1037
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,400
there is

1038
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,400
Paris

1039
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,559
thank you

1040
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,960
thank you

1041
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:34,099
thank you

1042
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
um

1043
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,439
[Music]

1044
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,440
thank you

1045
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:44,099
questions

1046
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,900
thank you

1047
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,920
thank you

1048
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,619
is it

1049
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,420
maybe I should have known this earlier

1050
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,300
so let's continue with this uh in the

1051
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,760
next question my social mixed desire

1052
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,000
I think I might need to skip question

1053
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,280
number four

1054
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,819
um or part number four and in any case I

1055
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:10,859
believe it's time to uh

1056
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:14,720
to go into the arguments here

1057
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:15,720
um

1058
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,160
sure the overarching Assumption amongst

1059
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,599
policy makers

1060
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,559
and also the dominant hypothesis amongst

1061
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,660
researchers

1062
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,680
seems to be that where you live

1063
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,780
affects your life chances

1064
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,920
yeah whether you live in Antwerp

1065
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,920
in this line blocking

1066
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,940
this social housing estate believe

1067
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,900
or whether you live as a poor person in

1068
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,599
alternate North where you have all these

1069
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,640
shops

1070
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,240
and ethnic bars and you have

1071
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,000
employment close by Etc

1072
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,400
that makes a difference

1073
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,220
yeah so the basic question

1074
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,819
of researchers has been can impoverished

1075
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:11,339
neighborhoods neighborhoods with a

1076
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:14,400
concentration of poverty can they make

1077
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,200
their residents worse

1078
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,720
because

1079
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,900
maybe two observations before our look

1080
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,599
into the different arguments the

1081
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:28,819
different

1082
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:31,260
ways in which this question has been

1083
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,359
answered

1084
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:34,859
observation number one is that

1085
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,240
researchers

1086
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,000
working in different sub-disciplines

1087
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,119
I've been showing you this diagram last

1088
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:43,680
week already

1089
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,599
research is working in different

1090
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,480
sub-disciplines of human geography or

1091
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,599
Urban studies more broadly have been

1092
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,359
answering this question differently

1093
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:56,760
and where would you position translator

1094
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,559
on the map

1095
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,339
what kind of Joker is he

1096
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:04,440
do you have an ID

1097
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,200
Marxist geographer writing about the

1098
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,660
capitalistic moment of production

1099
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,900
and he's a Marxist geographer

1100
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,559
and he's mainly interested in

1101
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,319
socio-economic

1102
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:20,940
issues

1103
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,900
yeah

1104
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,180
what happens to poor people when they

1105
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,920
live in a poor neighborhood

1106
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,020
other geographers have been asking

1107
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,119
different researchers for example

1108
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,500
relating to ethnicultural

1109
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,319
segregation as of all article wide by

1110
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:40,020
for example deals with

1111
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,420
ethnic segregation

1112
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,020
and not with social economic signage

1113
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,960
a Marxist geographer such as Tom Slater

1114
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,680
will be interested in

1115
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,480
socio-economic segregation where the

1116
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,819
poor and rich people live and is that

1117
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:58,020
meaningful

1118
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,059
in the eradication of poverty for

1119
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:00,900
example

1120
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,059
so you see the different geographers

1121
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:06,059
have been asking different research

1122
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:09,119
questions when it comes to these effects

1123
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,800
of segregation

1124
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,480
they have also been using different

1125
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,940
research methodologies

1126
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,319
we use large service they have a survey

1127
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:23,339
of 1 000 people in order to answer these

1128
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:25,319
questions or do you have qualitative

1129
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:27,240
research where you interviewed 30

1130
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,160
families

1131
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,220
number 13 30 people living in a

1132
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,339
neighborhood or displaced from looking

1133
00:58:34,339 --> 00:58:37,680
so different research methodologies and

1134
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,000
then you've also been reading

1135
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,000
that there might also be different

1136
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,040
ideological underpinnings

1137
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,680
uh underlying the work of these

1138
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,200
different so I think it is important for

1139
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,780
you to understand that just like I

1140
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,359
argued last week for the causes of

1141
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,000
segregation and the different arguments

1142
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,500
that have been

1143
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,319
even for why people live

1144
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,020
in segregated neighborhoods but also

1145
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,540
when it comes to these effects of

1146
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,640
segregation and the broad literature

1147
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,280
around it the people working in

1148
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,920
different positions and different

1149
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,540
sub-disciplines of human geography

1150
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,359
geography have been giving different

1151
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:26,220
answers to these questions

1152
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,260
another remark

1153
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,380
that I want to give before going to the

1154
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,260
answers to that question is that it is

1155
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,000
important

1156
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,960
to see that studies on neighborhood

1157
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,520
affects their birth marks what do I mean

1158
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,420
with it is that it matters rare a study

1159
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,059
takes place and often for example

1160
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:55,520
literature of the effects of segregation

1161
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,099
studies conducted in the United States

1162
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:01,079
that the conclusions of these studies

1163
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:03,660
have been used for example to influence

1164
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,599
policy in Western Europe

1165
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,579
and while it is

1166
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:11,520
quite important to see the differences

1167
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,920
between these different contexts last

1168
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,480
week I have been highlighting for

1169
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,359
example that and when it comes to

1170
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:21,480
desegregation in dishes and it turns out

1171
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,540
that segregation in the United States is

1172
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,480
much stronger more prevalent than it is

1173
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,920
in Europe

1174
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,900
yeah so that's an important difference

1175
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,480
when you take the conclusions from one

1176
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,040
country to the other

1177
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,880
the welfare states in Western Europe has

1178
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,339
been much more developed than in the

1179
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:43,140
United States so when it comes to

1180
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,540
poverty and the eradication of poverty

1181
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,420
this is a completely different issue in

1182
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,520
a western European context than a disc

1183
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,700
major Latin America

1184
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,280
so it's important

1185
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,119
that you contextualize studies on

1186
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,579
segregation in the United States for

1187
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,700
example and then you just do not

1188
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,119
transfer these conclusions to

1189
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:10,799
to Europe

1190
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,799
many of the

1191
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,180
um

1192
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,180
studies on neighborhood effects and the

1193
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,460
effects of segregation have been

1194
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,220
conducted in the Netherlands and also

1195
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,980
this Dutch context is a very peculiar

1196
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,119
way

1197
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,319
and where for example concerns about the

1198
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:33,420
bailiff that's what you see there a

1199
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,780
particular neighborhood in Amsterdam

1200
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,299
have been quite important in stimulating

1201
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:41,960
This research field

1202
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,980
I'm doing for time

1203
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,160
but this far right politicians in the

1204
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,960
Netherlands have always been brother but

1205
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,420
for two decades already have been a very

1206
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,599
vulgar yeah and that's also important to

1207
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,299
understand why and this research field

1208
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,880
has been sort of developed in the

1209
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,000
Netherlands so important to

1210
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,980
provincialize distance and to understand

1211
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:11,700
that a study in Vienna or in Antwerp or

1212
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,940
in Brussels or in the United States that

1213
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,339
it's important to contextualize and to

1214
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:19,380
understand the specificities of this

1215
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,640
particular context

1216
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:27,180
I have seven answers to this question I

1217
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,119
remember the question can impoverished

1218
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:32,579
neighborhoods make their residence worse

1219
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:35,280
off or when I'm interested in ethnic

1220
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,339
cultural segregation and neighborhoods

1221
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:41,880
with the concentration of uh people for

1222
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,319
origin make integration more difficult

1223
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,720
yeah

1224
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,160
um

1225
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,819
seven different arguments the first one

1226
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:57,240
The Social Network archives I think many

1227
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,460
of you might have heard of the work of

1228
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,900
Robert Putnam

1229
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,720
focusing on social capital or the social

1230
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,760
capital the connections among

1231
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,400
individuals the social networks the

1232
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,839
Norms of reciprocity reciprocity and

1233
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,579
trustworthiness that arise from

1234
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:17,520
making a distinction between owning

1235
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,400
Capital what is bombing Capital these

1236
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,339
are social networks connections Norms of

1237
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:26,760
reciprocity between socially homogeneous

1238
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,819
people for example people of the same

1239
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:32,400
ethnicity are people of the same social

1240
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,520
and economic group

1241
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,720
distinction between bonding and

1242
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,180
breaching and approaching Capital being

1243
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,299
actions networks launch of reciprocity

1244
01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:45,000
and trustworthiness during socially

1245
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,740
heterogeneous

1246
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,540
for example people of different

1247
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,859
ethnicities

1248
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:53,700
are people of different social economics

1249
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,940
and the argument is often that reaching

1250
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:00,540
capital is important for social Mobility

1251
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,960
yeah for example if you're poor

1252
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,099
from your middle class neighbor you will

1253
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:10,440
get to hear about jobs

1254
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,200
and it is a person who's working I mean

1255
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,059
there is a job opportunity in the office

1256
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,099
where this person learns he might share

1257
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:19,799
this knowledge that she might share it

1258
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:22,440
with is for her name

1259
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,099
to work and when you do not speak Dutch

1260
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:28,319
it might be good to have this white

1261
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:31,079
middle class family this Empire City

1262
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,540
Council was so interested in living next

1263
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,960
to you because you maybe they can help

1264
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,380
yourself or daughter with homework

1265
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,660
um as they Stitch and so these are the

1266
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:46,799
IDS behind this argument saying that

1267
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,480
well it's good

1268
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,880
to have mixed neighborhoods because

1269
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,200
these mixed neighborhoods will lead to

1270
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,660
heterogeneous networks they will lead to

1271
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,280
breaching capital and that will be

1272
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,619
important that will be to the benefits

1273
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:04,200
of poor people living in such a

1274
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,280
neighborhood

1275
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,339
and so one reason why you would want to

1276
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:11,280
create a socialist neighborhood is

1277
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,920
because you want to create heterogeneous

1278
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,559
social networks because you assume that

1279
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,280
bridging Capital will help poor people

1280
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,760
to be socially mobile and to join them

1281
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,420
to for example through education or true

1282
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,740
choice

1283
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,660
and so this is one of the seven

1284
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,099
arguments

1285
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:37,940
that underpins this ideal of social mix

1286
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:41,220
but when we study how people live

1287
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,339
it turns out that

1288
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:47,819
people are rather Mobile in a city do

1289
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,799
not limit their lives to a particular

1290
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:50,940
neighborhood

1291
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:53,280
and that many of the social networks

1292
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,260
that develop in a neighborhood spend

1293
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:58,260
different neighborhood borders and this

1294
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,200
is a study from

1295
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,900
in China looking at the social networks

1296
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,599
of people living in four different types

1297
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,299
of neighborhoods and in each of these

1298
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,880
neighborhoods the conclusion is that

1299
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,579
most people get to know people through

1300
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:16,380
work

1301
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:23,520
yeah and spent time with colleagues also

1302
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,180
um after after working hours

1303
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:29,160
and many people also get to know people

1304
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,079
through kinship

1305
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:34,079
from a childhood through the schools of

1306
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:36,559
their children

1307
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,720
and they are actually quite a small

1308
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,160
amount of social networks in each of

1309
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,720
these neighborhoods less than that

1310
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,340
percent

1311
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:47,760
[Music]

1312
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,900
um

1313
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,000
what um when you look at the social

1314
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,920
connections of these people there is a

1315
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,380
quite a small amount that helps in these

1316
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,720
neighborhoods and no matter in which of

1317
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,460
the four types of neighborhoods they

1318
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,780
look

1319
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,660
people seem to develop mostly

1320
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,720
bones

1321
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,960
connections networks with people from

1322
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,760
outside the snake

1323
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,700
and so this idea that by bringing the

1324
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,859
middle class for example to the middle

1325
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:19,140
class to a cool neighborhood that this

1326
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,660
would be a way to create these social

1327
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,599
networks and when you look at this then

1328
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:27,059
these social networks also develop

1329
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:29,280
outside the neighborhood so why to focus

1330
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,200
so much on that neighborhood where

1331
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,180
people live

1332
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:37,400
very culturally kind of like

1333
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,619
culture e

1334
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:42,619
ffort

1335
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,740
in other countries you mean yeah the

1336
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:49,760
situation would be different

1337
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,059
donations

1338
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:56,339
well I told you it's important to

1339
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:58,440
understand the context of this of this

1340
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,339
study

1341
01:07:59,339 --> 01:08:01,859
but in any case also for for Western

1342
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:03,900
European cities if you if you would

1343
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,599
study this process over time I think you

1344
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:10,440
would find out that connections are less

1345
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,780
neighborhood based than they used to I

1346
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,579
can imagine that this neighborhood will

1347
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:16,080
still be important

1348
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,640
and people still get to know a lot of

1349
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,479
um

1350
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:24,238
other families for example through their

1351
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,640
children through the school in many

1352
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,140
countries of the world we have a school

1353
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,479
pitching system where living in a

1354
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,339
neighborhood me sending your kids to the

1355
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:34,500
same school and so for sure there are

1356
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,799
many reasons why this would be different

1357
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:41,100
in other countries but overall I think

1358
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,238
this argument

1359
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,880
truth that there are also many social

1360
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,460
networks that the total outsides the

1361
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,380
neighborhood of course there are also

1362
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,299
studies that focus on burning produce

1363
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:52,679
and say well these people are less

1364
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:54,960
mobile than rich people and so it's

1365
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,698
exactly for these poor people that this

1366
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,500
neighborhood is an important

1367
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,620
uh

1368
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:04,259
ground of network population

1369
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:07,259
much more than it is for rich people

1370
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:09,899
and if you do not have a job if you do

1371
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:11,640
not have the money to buy a bus ticket

1372
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,738
now that's neighborhood context will be

1373
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:16,979
an important one for social networks to

1374
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:19,198
be develop that's also for different

1375
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,939
categories of people this might be

1376
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:22,460
different

1377
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,080
but still I think it's important to see

1378
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,238
that networks do not only develop inside

1379
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:29,339
a neighborhood that there are also

1380
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:33,600
networks in other parts of other parts

1381
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,979
of the city

1382
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,020
or with people living in other parts of

1383
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,140
this

1384
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,160
um

1385
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,719
drawing

1386
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:47,399
white double income families

1387
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:52,140
to a neighborhood such as model make and

1388
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,660
if it's possible will that then make

1389
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:58,860
these networks diverse a study by Sabina

1390
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,460
Rick and Mike

1391
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:05,880
in a German cities I think it was Marx

1392
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,060
law in the old area

1393
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:11,880
and they have been interviewing uh the

1394
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,780
white

1395
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,960
uh middle class people in this example

1396
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,340
two women

1397
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,739
about their social meds and there is

1398
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:21,659
quite a lot on this diagram I might need

1399
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:24,600
to explain it so you see the women in

1400
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,460
the middle and then you have different

1401
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,260
scales

1402
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,840
you know the neighborhoods you have the

1403
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,239
city you have Germany and you have

1404
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:36,540
outside of Germany and so people

1405
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,300
who are the important people in your

1406
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:43,679
life ask that and we put them on this

1407
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:45,239
diagram saying well there are people

1408
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:47,400
inside the neighborhoods people living

1409
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,080
in the same city but you also know

1410
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,000
people in the same country and people

1411
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,340
also living roles and for different

1412
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,199
people you would get to different

1413
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:59,280
diagrams and what they also did is to

1414
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,380
map a contact frequency

1415
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,020
so if you have frequent contacts this

1416
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,860
error will be more bold than it is for

1417
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,800
people so you can have a rare complex

1418
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,820
and then they also met the level of

1419
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:20,820
Education an indicator for a class

1420
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,679
room saying well are these people that

1421
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:27,060
you frequent are they people of with the

1422
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,760
same educational background

1423
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,580
middle class people high education

1424
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,460
Highly Educated or are these people who

1425
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,360
do not have Universal qualifications

1426
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,580
now the other thing that you see here is

1427
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,800
the type of relation between frequent

1428
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,600
these people or do they provide you with

1429
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,980
emotional support or instrumentals

1430
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:52,739
materials or a good talk for example on

1431
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:55,260
the issues so it's quite a complex not

1432
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,620
but what you see is that first of all

1433
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:02,040
just like in the Chinese example many

1434
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,699
people have social networks that are

1435
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:07,380
part of a social network with people

1436
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,900
living outside the neighborhoods and

1437
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,179
what you also see there is that most of

1438
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:14,400
the connections that these middle class

1439
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,679
women in these underprivileged

1440
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:19,800
neighborhoods develop are with other

1441
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,500
people with the same educational

1442
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:25,140
qualification so the idea that's

1443
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,659
bringing middle class people to another

1444
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:30,199
privileged neighborhood will create

1445
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:33,120
heterogeneous social networks in which

1446
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,980
you find poor and rich people people

1447
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,739
does not seem to hold true here because

1448
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:39,960
the middle class people that you attract

1449
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,480
to these neighborhoods create mostly

1450
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,820
social bonds with people like them with

1451
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,760
other middle thoughts

1452
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,159
the episode is bridging capital

1453
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,260
that was the reason why you wanted to

1454
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,719
make this neighborhood there's not

1455
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:57,560
really developed

1456
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,380
another argument is that

1457
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,840
creating a mixed neighborhood

1458
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,920
might disrupt the strong ties that exist

1459
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,920
there already the only Capital that

1460
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,860
exists and the strong forms of social

1461
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:17,040
economic emotional support that people

1462
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,560
of the same ethnicity for example

1463
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,860
provide when they live in a neighborhood

1464
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,760
part of the city

1465
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,800
so residents living in this interested

1466
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,400
parts of cities Slater argued fall back

1467
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,380
on what they know and what they have

1468
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:38,820
each other is bonding capital is crucial

1469
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:42,360
in the lives of poor people in the lives

1470
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,400
of newcomers who have just arrived to

1471
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,380
the city they will look for core ethics

1472
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,760
first

1473
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,520
and if you create a mix if you want to

1474
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,320
create a mixed neighborhood in these

1475
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,960
parts of cloud for example by attracting

1476
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,360
another class they will displace some

1477
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,219
people and that will disrupt this

1478
01:13:59,219 --> 01:14:01,620
bonding Capital Network system

1479
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,260
yeah so

1480
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:06,840
what I'm trying to do

1481
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,420
is to say well there is an argument

1482
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,580
there why you would create a mixed

1483
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,280
neighborhood but you also have

1484
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,179
a couple of counter arguments as to why

1485
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:21,120
argument might not work or the whole

1486
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,340
reason underlying that argument might

1487
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,600
not work

1488
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,699
social networks

1489
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:29,280
yeah Social Capital owning and bridging

1490
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,300
capital

1491
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,260
I guess you you got the point there

1492
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:37,980
a second argument is called underclass

1493
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,020
Art

1494
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,820
and this is an argument that has

1495
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,100
developed in the United States in the

1496
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,320
1980s

1497
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,540
and at that time there was a big

1498
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,980
discussion

1499
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,560
between structuralists

1500
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,560
who look at the causes of poverty in the

1501
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,600
declining economic base

1502
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,300
and for example Marxist geographers

1503
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,159
saying well there is a shift from a

1504
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,699
fullness to a post for this capitalism

1505
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:08,040
and this makes it harder for these

1506
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,080
people to quiet job

1507
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,360
or the arguments that you've heard in

1508
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,860
the classes by that Apostles about

1509
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,300
polarization

1510
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,020
is there a declining job markets

1511
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,239
so you're looking for structural causes

1512
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:24,000
of poverty and on the other hand you had

1513
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,840
cultures except poverty is dead because

1514
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,080
you have a culture of poverty

1515
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,260
poor people have certain attitudes have

1516
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,080
a certain behavior and this keeps them

1517
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,219
in poverty so that was an important

1518
01:15:40,219 --> 01:15:42,780
discussion between these two

1519
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,420
and this underclass argument

1520
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,880
is part of this cultural history of

1521
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,840
looking at poverty yeah who is this

1522
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,520
underclass

1523
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,400
they're not talking about all poor

1524
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,199
people in the case of the United States

1525
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:01,440
in the 1980s 33 million people were

1526
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,800
consistent who was this underclass that

1527
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,280
was a minority in this minority five

1528
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,100
million people yeah people who followed

1529
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,659
below the

1530
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:14,960
income threshold for which they are

1531
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,179
considered to be poor disproportionately

1532
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:22,080
Black and Hispanic minority in this poor

1533
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,300
minority but what defines them it's not

1534
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:27,120
so much the poverty or their base but

1535
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,739
their behavior

1536
01:16:28,739 --> 01:16:32,460
okay there's probably lawlessness drug

1537
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:35,400
use out of Redwood Birds lack of

1538
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,040
employment welfare dependency and school

1539
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,060
faith

1540
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:42,120
and also these culturalists blame the

1541
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,140
poor

1542
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,659
to be poor because of their own behavior

1543
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:46,860
and

1544
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:49,260
the way they look different

1545
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:52,500
and so this is this underclass argument

1546
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,880
so what is the argument exactly that in

1547
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,860
ketos or in neighborhoods where you find

1548
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:02,159
the concentration of poor people that

1549
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,800
you find more unemployment more welfare

1550
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,080
dependency more early School Leaving

1551
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,380
more truancy or criminality more

1552
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:13,620
gambling more direct abuse more alcohol

1553
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,159
abuse more out of Bedford Sports teenage

1554
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:20,040
pregnancy more dysfunctional values

1555
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,280
whatever that may aim due to

1556
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,260
okay

1557
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:27,179
socialization affects within these

1558
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:28,739
things

1559
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:30,960
if you grow up in a neighborhood like

1560
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,800
that

1561
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,620
and your peers

1562
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,840
the people of your age the people that

1563
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,179
you frequent

1564
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:43,040
will have a higher chance to be

1565
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,739
criminals or gamblers or drug users or

1566
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:48,960
alcohol abusers Etc

1567
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,239
and that is why in such neighborhood you

1568
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:54,060
find more of this

1569
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:57,360
we also find a lack of role models with

1570
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,120
a job without a drug addiction without

1571
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,920
an alcohol

1572
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,460
IC and who were not teenage mothers Etc

1573
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,320
so there's a lack of

1574
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,600
positive role models

1575
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,719
and you also have this peer group effect

1576
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:16,020
and so why are you worse of living as a

1577
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,199
poor person in a poor neighborhood the

1578
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,659
argument of this culture this was that

1579
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:25,260
is because you have these Norms you have

1580
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:27,239
a lack of these role models and you have

1581
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:30,000
these peer group effects which made it

1582
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,159
well that's why it's your worst of

1583
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,460
living

1584
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,480
they also refer to physical

1585
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,760
infrastructure institutional networks

1586
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,620
the argument was

1587
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,780
that but this has been quite an

1588
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,120
important argument many policy makers

1589
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,699
have been facing

1590
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:50,699
or helping arguing for socialists

1591
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:53,100
because of this

1592
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,580
because they were convinced that living

1593
01:18:56,580 --> 01:19:00,659
in a poor neighborhood increased the

1594
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:03,300
chances that you found a job less

1595
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,420
important than you leave school early

1596
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:09,659
and because of of your friends doing the

1597
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:11,280
saying that you don't go to school

1598
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,380
because your friends would do so as well

1599
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,179
that you would turn into a criminal

1600
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:17,640
because this is the example that you

1601
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,420
have seen mostly

1602
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:26,100
okay now even when there would be a link

1603
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,679
between what is on the left and these

1604
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:30,540
poor neighborhoods then it can still be

1605
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:33,000
wonders whether what is the causal

1606
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,199
relationship

1607
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:36,060
between these two

1608
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,940
here on the map you have Chicago again a

1609
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,040
city that we are getting quite familiar

1610
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,100
with you see the poverty level

1611
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,920
in these neighborhoods that the darker

1612
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,739
the red the poorer the neighborhoods are

1613
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:51,780
and you see

1614
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:55,560
people arrested

1615
01:19:56,060 --> 01:20:00,540
for a drug use or

1616
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,780
something like this the possession of of

1617
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,040
Turks

1618
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,340
and what you see there is that uh

1619
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,520
there is a correlation

1620
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,020
between

1621
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:16,020
poverty and the concentration of poverty

1622
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:19,080
this neighborhood and the use of quality

1623
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,320
correct and coping is much scattered

1624
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,800
much more scattered and but you also see

1625
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,340
that in the other neighborhoods where

1626
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:32,280
you have a concentration of poverty that

1627
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,580
is much less the case

1628
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,460
now I can also wonder to what extent

1629
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,380
this graph

1630
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:46,560
is the result of real drug use or the

1631
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,540
policing of these Neighbors

1632
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,640
if you have a police force that is much

1633
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,540
more

1634
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:54,360
on the outlook for drug use in certain

1635
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,980
neighborhoods well that it's logical

1636
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,020
that this will show up in English

1637
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,280
statistics

1638
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,040
so there are many reasons why one could

1639
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,739
raise concerns about the causal

1640
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:07,140
relationship in this case between drug

1641
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,300
use on the one hand and the

1642
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,820
concentration of poverty on public so it

1643
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:14,820
could start to criticize like how these

1644
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,860
statistics came about one can also see

1645
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:19,500
that for certain drugs there seems to be

1646
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,739
a correlation for other circles one can

1647
01:21:22,739 --> 01:21:24,420
also see that you have concentrated

1648
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:28,260
poverty that corresponds with a lot of

1649
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,420
arrests for drug use but that you also

1650
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,980
have neighborhoods with concentration

1651
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,980
concentrated poverty organ specialists

1652
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,860
so there are many reasons why we would

1653
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,540
start to question whether there is a

1654
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,120
real cause of relation relationship

1655
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,940
concentration of poverty on the one hand

1656
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:47,699
and all these other indicators here on

1657
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:51,120
the slide on the other hand

1658
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,840
and another another argument against

1659
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,739
this underclass argument would be well

1660
01:21:57,739 --> 01:22:00,960
again socialization

1661
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,380
be disappears to not only live in these

1662
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:05,219
neighborhoods

1663
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:08,219
these Role Models do not only live in

1664
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:10,560
the neighborhood and Barack Obama could

1665
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,179
also be around

1666
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:14,699
yeah engine can can get these Role

1667
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:17,699
Models through TV or the the music that

1668
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:21,719
you're missing so why this focus on the

1669
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:23,699
neighborhood again

1670
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:26,520
third argument for social cohesion

1671
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,199
arguments

1672
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:30,719
and here you see

1673
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,960
um the basic line of thought

1674
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,620
of this of this argument where the

1675
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,140
ethnic minorities live isolated from

1676
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:43,260
native touch they have less contact with

1677
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,960
Native touch consequently they do not

1678
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:49,080
acquire an adequate command of the Dutch

1679
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,780
language are not likely to adopt such

1680
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:55,020
Norms values and will not succeed in

1681
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,420
socioeconomic terms

1682
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,780
so here you see a mixing of arguments

1683
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:03,540
about ethnic segregation

1684
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:06,179
and socio-economic Mobility

1685
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:08,820
saying that well if you live

1686
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:10,440
in a neighborhood with a high

1687
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:13,260
concentration of people of foreign

1688
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,460
background

1689
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,980
who speak their mother tongue and who

1690
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:20,219
are less good in speaking Dutch

1691
01:23:20,219 --> 01:23:24,000
and if you have less contact with

1692
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,940
native Dutch people then you will not

1693
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:30,900
acquire an adequate comment language you

1694
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,540
are not likely to evoke Dutch morals and

1695
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,620
values and therefore

1696
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:40,800
succeeds another argument that has been

1697
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,440
quite an important

1698
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,260
in the kind of rhetorics and the kind of

1699
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:49,380
discourse of policy makers advocating a

1700
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:50,520
social mix

1701
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,580
saying for example it's not good that in

1702
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:54,840
modern Bank you have a high

1703
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:58,219
concentration of foreign

1704
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:01,380
why is that not good well these people

1705
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:04,380
will not get to speak Dutch and they

1706
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:08,460
will not integrate to use that word they

1707
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:11,640
will not adults touch notes and values

1708
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:14,340
and that will make it harder for them to

1709
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:17,640
climb to social media

1710
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,540
again one can Wonder yeah is it only in

1711
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:24,060
the neighborhood that people could get a

1712
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,300
chance to develop this kind of

1713
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,300
relationships with Native touch even

1714
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:33,420
arguments true you could look at what is

1715
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,520
researchers do I will not go into the

1716
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,620
into all the details that they say about

1717
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:40,460
as own that's a place where people

1718
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:43,260
develop social networks you've got

1719
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,940
leisure activities through which people

1720
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,860
can develop

1721
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:49,199
you've got work and you've got the

1722
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,719
transport between these three different

1723
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:54,120
so it's important to look at all these

1724
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,340
domains and to see what happens between

1725
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,540
people

1726
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,280
and then you might see that this

1727
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,020
neighborhood in which these people live

1728
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:03,600
is less important

1729
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,120
another counter argument with focus on

1730
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,820
the importance of local culture it's

1731
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:11,280
only because you have a concentration of

1732
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,920
people of a certain ethnic background

1733
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,340
for example that you can support

1734
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:19,760
the shop that sells

1735
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,380
ethnic products that sell the food that

1736
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,780
sells the food from the home group where

1737
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:27,600
it allows you to have a church or an

1738
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,199
association by focusing on a particular

1739
01:25:30,199 --> 01:25:33,060
ethnic group and these kind of places

1740
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:36,420
might be very important they will act as

1741
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,460
a protective space they will act as a

1742
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,739
safe space in which these people feel

1743
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:43,020
like they've gone and this feeling of

1744
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,179
belonging might be very important for

1745
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:50,400
them to and to find a life in this new

1746
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,159
country where they are living

1747
01:25:53,159 --> 01:25:57,500
the social cohesion argument

1748
01:25:57,540 --> 01:26:00,719
a fourth argument will focus on local

1749
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,100
services

1750
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:06,480
yeah and it will say that for example in

1751
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,080
in

1752
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:12,540
neighborhoods with the concentration of

1753
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,120
poverty that you will have less public

1754
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,400
and private Services there will be less

1755
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,360
shops there will be less Banks and you

1756
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,820
might also have less Public Service

1757
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:27,480
these are examples from lootball social

1758
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,100
housing estate that I've been talking

1759
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:33,179
about today already and the closure of a

1760
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:36,300
bank and there is no ATM anymore in our

1761
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,440
paper

1762
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,600
the argument could go well if there

1763
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,699
would be more middle class people then

1764
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:44,159
there would be higher interest from

1765
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:48,500
Banks to have an ATM

1766
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,820
or other other ships

1767
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:56,400
Chicago

1768
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,800
food deserts I don't know whether you've

1769
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,380
ever heard about this term but if you

1770
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,139
look at healthy foods

1771
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:08,580
grocery shops where can you find them if

1772
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:12,020
you see a map with these different

1773
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:16,100
racial groups I remember it is this

1774
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,060
self-identification in the case of

1775
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,040
America that is a survey for which

1776
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,380
racial group to itself identifiably

1777
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,860
identified you see neighborhoods

1778
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,800
predominantly white black Hispanic Asian

1779
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,320
diverse and you see that in many of

1780
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,300
these black neighborhoods which are also

1781
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,000
the tourist neighborhoods you find that

1782
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,060
it's very hard to find healthy food it's

1783
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,980
very hard to find fresh vegetables like

1784
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:43,679
fruit because the shops are so far

1785
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:46,679
yeah so the argument would be that it's

1786
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,480
better to create mixed neighborhoods

1787
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,880
because that will attract a diverse set

1788
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,560
of

1789
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,739
um shops and services to these

1790
01:27:55,739 --> 01:27:57,360
neighborhoods

1791
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,699
we've already been talking about this

1792
01:27:59,699 --> 01:28:02,340
that the question of course is what kind

1793
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,380
of shops and what kind of services do

1794
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,360
you get in the case of this Mentor

1795
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:09,000
eyelasher District one person said well

1796
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,260
but this people will not feel

1797
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,260
comfortable shops and they will also not

1798
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:15,239
find the products they would like to

1799
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:16,560
find

1800
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,760
that's also in gentrifying neighborhoods

1801
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,800
and what kind of

1802
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,780
shops do you find there

1803
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:27,300
is a shops catering for

1804
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,280
people who look for the cheapest food

1805
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,719
possible because they have only five

1806
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:36,480
euro to spend in in the last three days

1807
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,620
of the month

1808
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:42,060
or is it cafes or restaurants who try to

1809
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,000
cater for these

1810
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,739
incoming Gentry Fighters

1811
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:49,139
so it's important to look at the

1812
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:51,600
different shaded demands that will

1813
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,080
result from creating a mixed and so the

1814
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,880
question is if you've mixed name routes

1815
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,060
will these shops and services cater for

1816
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,239
these poor people

1817
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,980
because if that's not the case then it

1818
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:07,920
will displace the shops that existed

1819
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,320
there already ended catered For This

1820
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,760
audience

1821
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,860
in answer we've also been talking about

1822
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,260
a lot of these

1823
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:18,000
specialized services that you might get

1824
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,860
in neighborhoods

1825
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,739
and at least

1826
01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:26,100
money transfer short steps or Food Shops

1827
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:30,659
like some African vegetables or

1828
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:33,420
Thai ingredients

1829
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:35,639
and the question is if you try to mix

1830
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:37,920
these neighborhoods to these kind of

1831
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,900
shops and these kind of services still

1832
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:44,400
be able to to be to remain or will they

1833
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,920
also be displaced because this place

1834
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,460
will be involved by a fancy coffee shop

1835
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:54,840
that is mainly catered for these Gentry

1836
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:57,659
farmers so questions around shops

1837
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,940
Services catering for different

1838
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:02,940
audiences

1839
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:06,179
argument that you find in the literature

1840
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:08,400
is a political one

1841
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,179
starting from the observation that many

1842
01:30:11,179 --> 01:30:13,940
neighborhood associations for example

1843
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:19,739
are well mainly run by middle class

1844
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:21,900
and that middle class people are are

1845
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,540
much more focal in expressing their

1846
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:26,340
concerns about the people

1847
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,860
and so one could say that well by

1848
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:31,380
attracting the middle class to a poor

1849
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,480
neighborhood this neighborhood will be

1850
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,159
higher on the political agenda

1851
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:40,199
um and I I have this quote there from

1852
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:42,780
that I read at the end of the Excursion

1853
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:45,780
inshallah in my channel for people

1854
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,940
stating well there are also taxpayers

1855
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:50,340
why don't you listen to us

1856
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:53,100
yeah so the idea is that by mixing

1857
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,159
neighborhoods you will put these

1858
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:59,219
neighborhoods higher Jim

1859
01:30:59,219 --> 01:31:02,639
I'm in Belgium people from outside the

1860
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:05,940
EU without a built-in passport we are

1861
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:07,260
able to vote

1862
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,120
but this will not be the case in every

1863
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,100
country and so you can have a

1864
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,679
neighborhood with a lot of people from

1865
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,679
outside the room who do not have a say

1866
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:19,199
in vocal politics and why would this

1867
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:23,100
local mayor address the concerns of

1868
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,780
people living

1869
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:27,540
any of these people are not able to

1870
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:31,320
Express their needs and to put a stamp

1871
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,120
on the political agenda then why would

1872
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,639
you do so the argument is well middle

1873
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:37,679
class people are

1874
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,320
able they have these connections with

1875
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,719
politicians or at least they will be

1876
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,500
listened to

1877
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,960
um

1878
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,840
well in I'm not going to go into into

1879
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,120
that into that example

1880
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,159
um but it dealt with the Emperor of

1881
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:57,600
Highway

1882
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,360
and that issue of air pollution to the

1883
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,920
observation that most of the

1884
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,199
neighborhoods lying next to that Highway

1885
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:07,380
are rather so one good question what

1886
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,659
would happen with this whole issue of

1887
01:32:09,659 --> 01:32:12,780
the whole debate around the highway if

1888
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:15,480
these neighborhoods could not be your

1889
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,940
neighborhoods bogus income but rather

1890
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:21,980
than they were the highest activities

1891
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,800
so the political arguments

1892
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,199
by mixing neighborhoods we will put them

1893
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:30,239
higher on the political agent

1894
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,340
of course the issue isn't my report

1895
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:36,560
she's not listened to poor people

1896
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,820
political agenda without these middle

1897
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,520
class residents

1898
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,679
the sixth argument is a bit different

1899
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:49,679
the spatial mismatch does not focus so

1900
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,699
much on the issue of segregation but if

1901
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:57,179
you follow these five dimensions of

1902
01:32:57,179 --> 01:32:57,840
um

1903
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,179
Messi and London it focuses on

1904
01:33:00,179 --> 01:33:03,360
concentration clustering where do poor

1905
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,460
people live in which part of the city

1906
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,560
are these neighborhoods with the

1907
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:11,100
concentration of poverty and this is a

1908
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,980
diagram from Cape Town quite an old one

1909
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:16,380
but it's still very much the game the

1910
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,440
case where do you have job opportunities

1911
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,460
in light and where do you have

1912
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:25,440
population where do people live and

1913
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,739
where do they where where could they

1914
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:31,199
and most of the job opportunities are

1915
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:32,940
still in the previously white

1916
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,699
neighborhoods particularly in essential

1917
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:38,340
business district of Cape Town but most

1918
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:41,760
of the poor people in Cape Town are

1919
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,159
living quite far away from these places

1920
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:46,139
so there is a mismatch between the

1921
01:33:46,139 --> 01:33:49,080
places where it's good lift and the

1922
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,960
places where the good potential work and

1923
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,940
so it's not just important to focus on

1924
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:56,820
segregation and the fact that poverty is

1925
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:58,020
concentrated

1926
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,600
in these more peripheral neighborhoods

1927
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,980
in the case

1928
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:04,139
but you need to focus then also on the

1929
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:06,120
distance between various neighborhoods

1930
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:08,159
are and the places where these people

1931
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,620
could work so there's this the spatial

1932
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:13,199
mismatch argument focusing on the

1933
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:16,320
mismatch between place of residence and

1934
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:20,840
potential places of the world

1935
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:24,900
Western European cities tend to have a

1936
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,540
better public transport than North

1937
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:29,880
American for southern

1938
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:32,280
so one could argue this argument will

1939
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,679
hold less true in the case of Brussels

1940
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:37,560
for example because even if you live in

1941
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:40,080
Philadelphia there are good training

1942
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:44,179
connections to Apple short places

1943
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,679
um this is a map

1944
01:34:46,679 --> 01:34:49,260
for Brussels

1945
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:52,679
job density you see two clusters the

1946
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:53,880
inner city

1947
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:56,639
and all these offices and the area

1948
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:59,659
around the airport

1949
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,679
um where the poor people in Brussels

1950
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:05,219
live mostly in this 19th century belt

1951
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:09,060
around beginners meaning that there's

1952
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,400
not so much of a spatial mismatch if you

1953
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,040
live in Mozambique you can walk to many

1954
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,380
job opportunities of course the question

1955
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:19,500
like this where do you have both skilled

1956
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,719
job properties

1957
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:24,000
so if you don't need a lot of Education

1958
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,920
when you see that more or less the same

1959
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,960
clusters

1960
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,960
their scores as Jobs shift

1961
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,260
towards the airport the issue is what

1962
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,420
are the transport connections between

1963
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:39,620
Golden Bank St

1964
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:44,100
Josephs and these areas where you find

1965
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:48,120
the growth of most new or most new jobs

1966
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,100
and in the case of Brussels the issue

1967
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:51,300
will also be

1968
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:53,639
what are the language requirements for

1969
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:55,620
these jobs because these are jobs

1970
01:35:55,620 --> 01:36:00,360
flounders what kind of touch proficiency

1971
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:03,060
do you need and often for these jobs

1972
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:05,400
that will be touched and French maybe

1973
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:09,659
also English so just language wise these

1974
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:14,040
jobs are already quite difficult

1975
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,199
so the spatial mismatch argument

1976
01:36:16,199 --> 01:36:19,320
focusing on the location of these poor

1977
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,360
neighborhoods so it's not just

1978
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,400
how mixed these neighborhoods are

1979
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,380
whether poor and richness side by side

1980
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:27,840
but where do these concentrations of

1981
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,420
poverty occur

1982
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:33,300
last argument stigmatism

1983
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:36,360
and this is an argument that Slater has

1984
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,400
been writing about it is important to

1985
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,340
look what happens outside of these

1986
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,380
neighborhoods understood

1987
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:46,500
you know why is it harder to climb the

1988
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:49,080
social leather to embroider out for all

1989
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,480
of the equivalents because teachers who

1990
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,179
live outside this neighborhood come with

1991
01:36:54,179 --> 01:36:57,360
a set of stereotypes about pupils in

1992
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,360
these schools and that will not give

1993
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,520
them the same

1994
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,860
educational chances as people going to a

1995
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,540
school in other games

1996
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:09,480
or if your postcode is I don't know what

1997
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:12,840
is the postcode if you apply for a job

1998
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:16,080
and you okay

1999
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,260
if you apply for a joke and this is your

2000
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:20,400
address is there

2001
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,560
debt and potential employers might

2002
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,199
already come the set of stereotypes why

2003
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:26,760
not too high

2004
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:31,380
so why would it be good then to create a

2005
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:34,139
social mix well one could create or what

2006
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,600
could argue for a social mix because

2007
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,260
that will reduce the stigma located or

2008
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:44,280
the stigma attached to these things

2009
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:47,219
and of course there might also be other

2010
01:37:47,219 --> 01:37:49,920
ways to work on that stigma you don't

2011
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,139
need a mix to do that you also can make

2012
01:37:52,139 --> 01:37:53,940
people living outside this neighborhood

2013
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:55,860
which you can make them aware of

2014
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:59,780
and what has really happened inside

2015
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,239
and so but this stigmatization my

2016
01:38:03,239 --> 01:38:06,060
potential employers or teachers or

2017
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:08,280
policemen who work in these

2018
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,260
neighborhoods but who do not live there

2019
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:14,100
could be another argument as to why a

2020
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:17,460
social mix is necessary

2021
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:19,260
yes

2022
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:22,199
so are people living in impoverished is

2023
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:23,940
it well does it make does it matter

2024
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:26,400
whether you are poor enough

2025
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,159
mostly poor neighborhood surrounded by

2026
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:32,820
people like you or whether you live as a

2027
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,980
poor person in a mixed neighborhood does

2028
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,380
that matter there are seven arguments

2029
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:40,260
that I have given now as to why that

2030
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:42,060
could matter

2031
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:45,000
okay for each of these seven I've also

2032
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,560
given a couple of counter arguments

2033
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,560
as to why creating a mix could actually

2034
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,520
be a bad thing to distract the ties that

2035
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,699
exist already yeah or is not necessary

2036
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:02,460
because people find peers and Role

2037
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,860
Models outside the neighborhood

2038
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:08,040
or people will middle class people

2039
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,940
arrive in these neighborhoods will not

2040
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:14,520
create uh social networks with the

2041
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,880
people

2042
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,320
Etc so for each of these arguments I've

2043
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:24,179
given a couple of counter arguments

2044
01:39:24,179 --> 01:39:26,820
what about the privileged

2045
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:29,040
I will skip that

2046
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,679
in Tom Slater's paper you will find many

2047
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,679
arguments for that

2048
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:39,139
um I will get to a small conclusion

2049
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,600
okay so when we discuss this ideal

2050
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:45,600
social mix and we discuss the question

2051
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,960
is social mix feasible is social Mis

2052
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,620
desirable then what is my take on it I

2053
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,719
think Avis romaville

2054
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,699
who has been doing a lot of work on

2055
01:39:56,699 --> 01:40:00,060
housing here in Brussels has summarized

2056
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,920
this quite well

2057
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,980
the concept of social mixed you rights

2058
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:09,360
which now legitimizes a good part of the

2059
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,300
regional interventions in the area of

2060
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,580
housing here in Brussels she's talking

2061
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:17,400
about the Brussels capital region and

2062
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,280
how the ideal of social mix for the

2063
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,280
concept of social mix has legitimized a

2064
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,080
good part of this intervention

2065
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:28,139
is according to her not very convinced

2066
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:29,520
convinced

2067
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,020
the gentrification which is underway in

2068
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:35,699
the central neighborhoods

2069
01:40:35,699 --> 01:40:38,040
in those neighborhoods where

2070
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,100
these authorities are doing making a big

2071
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,520
effort to attract military

2072
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:47,880
indicates that when there is a mix

2073
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:51,900
it is only a Prelude to the eviction of

2074
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,420
the most disadvantaged via the

2075
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:57,120
mechanisms of a completely deregulated

2076
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:01,320
real estate markets we live in a city

2077
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:05,900
but only ten percent of the total

2078
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:09,540
residential units our social housing

2079
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:12,659
yeah there is almost no control over the

2080
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:15,000
remaining 90 percent

2081
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,820
and so if you try to attract

2082
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:20,040
middle class residents

2083
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:23,820
to this 19th century

2084
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,620
an industrial neighborhoods around

2085
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:28,260
Brussels if you do that then it will

2086
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:30,659
push out over the elsewhere you've seen

2087
01:41:30,659 --> 01:41:32,880
it in the snap of I clicking where do

2088
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,040
these poor people moving out of a

2089
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,900
gentrifying neighborhood so that they

2090
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:39,179
move to build world

2091
01:41:39,179 --> 01:41:44,300
to ask to dedicate to however

2092
01:41:44,659 --> 01:41:48,060
you move poverty elsewhere

2093
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:51,840
so when there is a mix it can exist for

2094
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,000
a while but then it's only a produced to

2095
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,800
the eviction of the most disadvantages

2096
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,460
because rents will go up eventually

2097
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,260
and these poor people that live there

2098
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,659
are not able to afford these rents I

2099
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:06,179
will need to move elsewhere to find a

2100
01:42:06,179 --> 01:42:07,139
place

2101
01:42:07,139 --> 01:42:10,320
so this social makes feasible

2102
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,920
in the case of Brussels with very little

2103
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:16,679
uh controlled of authorities on the

2104
01:42:16,679 --> 01:42:19,500
housing markets no this is not feasible

2105
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:20,880
she said

2106
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,820
is it desirable a second question that I

2107
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:26,820
asked even if this eviction could be

2108
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:30,900
avoided even if you think of a situation

2109
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:35,460
25 social housing every 50 percent and

2110
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:38,280
you will not evict this poor people from

2111
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:40,860
these neighborhoods then she argues

2112
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:43,920
there is nothing to indicate that these

2113
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,320
disadvantaged populations would

2114
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,440
eventually benefit in any way from this

2115
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,420
mix

2116
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:54,540
and why because the attraction of this

2117
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:57,300
building of families would change the

2118
01:42:57,300 --> 01:43:01,260
shops will not lead to this

2119
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:04,199
heterogeneous networks that these policy

2120
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:07,139
makers dream

2121
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:10,080
that will not lead to the kind of social

2122
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:14,540
cohesion that underlies this

2123
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:17,219
social cognition

2124
01:43:17,219 --> 01:43:19,800
does not

2125
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,500
um make the kind of role models

2126
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,900
with people who believed in this

2127
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:26,760
underclass argument

2128
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:29,580
and we're hoping for Etc

2129
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:31,739
and so she's arguing in the case of

2130
01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:34,400
Brussels again it's important to

2131
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,840
provincialize these studies and to

2132
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,460
understand the complexity of the

2133
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:41,840
Brussels case only 10 social housing

2134
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,320
poverty at this moment concentrated in

2135
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:47,940
neighborhoods with quite a good voltage

2136
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:50,760
very close to these jobs and so there

2137
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,159
are many particularities that we need to

2138
01:43:53,159 --> 01:43:55,920
understand but what she is arguing is

2139
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,560
that the kind of social mix that this

2140
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,300
Brussels Capital feature tries to tries

2141
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,880
to create leads to the displacement of

2142
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:06,060
people to neighborhoods to parts of the

2143
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:08,820
city which are much much less connected

2144
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:10,560
through job opportunities

2145
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:13,440
where you find much less shops and

2146
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,600
services

2147
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,960
Etc so too much

2148
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:21,719
worst locations actually and even if

2149
01:44:21,719 --> 01:44:23,880
this kind of mix could be realized she

2150
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,540
argues then this is not desirable and

2151
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:29,580
disadvantaged population will not

2152
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,800
benefit from this this will not help

2153
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,860
them to climb the social benefit and she

2154
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:37,679
will draw on all the seven counter

2155
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:42,199
arguments that I've given uh to uh

2156
01:44:42,199 --> 01:44:46,340
substantiate this claim

2157
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,080
so

2158
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,900
well I think when you

2159
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:55,199
I remember that I once asked an exam

2160
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,360
question such as put yourself the shoes

2161
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:00,300
of the man of Antwerp you are now the

2162
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:03,060
mayor of network but you

2163
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,020
um

2164
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:06,719
promulgate social mixed policies or not

2165
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:08,880
the question was a bit more complicated

2166
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,119
but summary I think it's important that

2167
01:45:12,119 --> 01:45:13,920
when you have such a question when you

2168
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:17,100
ever work for a city or when you need to

2169
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:19,679
discuss this from an academic point of

2170
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:21,119
view I think there are a couple of

2171
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,699
questions that you need to ask

2172
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:27,300
yeah the first one is whom are we

2173
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:29,300
talking about

2174
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:32,219
why do we treat why do we want to create

2175
01:45:32,219 --> 01:45:34,080
a social mix

2176
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,420
is it because we say well this is the

2177
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:40,139
interest under privilege or I've skipped

2178
01:45:40,139 --> 01:45:41,639
now most of this

2179
01:45:41,639 --> 01:45:43,920
a part of the class could it also be in

2180
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,320
interest of the privilege I remember we

2181
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,380
were in Prescott one of the Richard

2182
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:53,639
richer richest municipalities of Belgium

2183
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:55,980
and some of you said well it'd be good

2184
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:59,280
to have some uh more diverse details

2185
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,100
because people might for example change

2186
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:04,260
the way they think about poor people if

2187
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:07,139
they have some of them living books by

2188
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:10,199
you see that all of the arguments

2189
01:46:10,199 --> 01:46:13,199
so far have been dealing with the under

2190
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:15,600
privilege so for that reason I think

2191
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,699
it's important to ask

2192
01:46:17,699 --> 01:46:20,040
what about the crystals

2193
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,739
and in the discussion

2194
01:46:22,739 --> 01:46:24,960
seminars that we have next week there

2195
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,420
will be one paper that I've written

2196
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:29,360
together

2197
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,340
that deals with it so we have a chance

2198
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,920
to come back to this true I think I'll

2199
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,900
discussions

2200
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:40,219
do we only focus on

2201
01:46:40,219 --> 01:46:42,900
socioeconomic segregation are also are

2202
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,820
we also interested in this ethnic

2203
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:47,820
arguments have you seen for example in

2204
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:50,520
the social cohesion argument the two

2205
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,980
were conflated and so do we want to

2206
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:56,639
create a social mix in the interest of

2207
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:59,219
ethnic minorities or does the ethnic

2208
01:46:59,219 --> 01:47:00,420
majority

2209
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,940
if that still exists because more and

2210
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:05,580
more cities in Belgium do not have an

2211
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:07,920
ethnic majority

2212
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,380
but we also

2213
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:12,900
think about this group and we want to

2214
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:15,780
promulgate search boxes

2215
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:18,540
are we interested in the second

2216
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:22,139
residence who are there already or are

2217
01:47:22,139 --> 01:47:25,199
we mainly thinking about newcomers or

2218
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:26,520
arrivals

2219
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,580
and so I think this question for whom do

2220
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,679
we want to create a social effects in

2221
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:35,159
whose interests is the first one that

2222
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:36,980
you should ask

2223
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:41,400
a second one is the issue of scale

2224
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,159
I told you last week already scheduled

2225
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:46,560
is the Crux of the matter if you want to

2226
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,440
calculate segregation in dishes it

2227
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,560
matters at which scale you do so in

2228
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,940
Belgium we have this very small

2229
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:56,639
statistical units and for that reason we

2230
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:58,020
find that there's

2231
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:01,619
high levels of segregation but if you

2232
01:48:01,619 --> 01:48:04,199
would make the statistical units bigger

2233
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:07,460
then there would be less signage

2234
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:10,699
your comments about the Reds Square

2235
01:48:10,699 --> 01:48:13,320
relates to this we can create a social

2236
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:16,679
mix in this very small neighborhood and

2237
01:48:16,679 --> 01:48:19,260
if you would look at the bigger picture

2238
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,600
if you would look at this I mentioned

2239
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,840
area as a whole then you would find out

2240
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,000
that there is no social business mostly

2241
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,340
wealthy people who have settled there

2242
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:31,500
and so I think scale

2243
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:34,440
is a very important issue as well as the

2244
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,080
question where do we want to create

2245
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:38,639
assumptions

2246
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,619
I think that most of

2247
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:44,159
the social mix literature is concerned

2248
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:46,199
with this disadvantaged neighborhoods

2249
01:48:46,199 --> 01:48:49,560
the focus is on these neighborhoods and

2250
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:52,199
the need to create Associates

2251
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:54,659
if you would look at more than make you

2252
01:48:54,659 --> 01:48:56,639
would look at socio-economic position of

2253
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:58,739
people and if you would look at the

2254
01:48:58,739 --> 01:49:01,619
ethnic maker of this neighborhood you

2255
01:49:01,619 --> 01:49:03,719
will find out that modern day is maybe

2256
01:49:03,719 --> 01:49:06,420
the most socially mixed neighborhoods or

2257
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:08,760
Brussels if not Belgium

2258
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,159
and most of the homogeneous

2259
01:49:11,159 --> 01:49:14,119
neighborhoods are white Suburban

2260
01:49:14,119 --> 01:49:16,860
municipalities so why are we only

2261
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:19,860
concerned with this disadvantaged

2262
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:22,860
neighborhoods Hawaii are we not

2263
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:25,860
concerned with the homogeneity of many

2264
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:27,900
of these Suburban groups

2265
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:30,780
which are better off is there a need to

2266
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:34,020
create a social mix as well or not and

2267
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:36,360
I've inverse cards for those who joined

2268
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:38,880
to enter by talking about the way they

2269
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,040
protested against the trend against the

2270
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:44,119
local Asylum Center against any attempt

2271
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:47,940
to uh well to to make this

2272
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:50,940
municipality

2273
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:53,639
I could even argue that most of the

2274
01:49:53,639 --> 01:49:56,100
literature and most of the concerns of

2275
01:49:56,100 --> 01:50:00,080
policy makers Target only those

2276
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:03,320
disadvantaged neighborhoods which are

2277
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:06,780
centrifiable which have the potential to

2278
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:09,840
attract middle class newcomers because

2279
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,300
that's good for the next but then the

2280
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:15,540
question becomes rare is this possible

2281
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:19,080
and then enter we have been on this

2282
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:22,679
triangular Square Bowling plane well if

2283
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:24,300
you look at the houses there there are

2284
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:26,580
many fancy

2285
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:27,719
um houses

2286
01:50:27,719 --> 01:50:29,880
which are

2287
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:35,760
potential homes for rich uh families

2288
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,679
but if you move more to the north you

2289
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:40,980
only find very small houses which will

2290
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:42,840
never attract this kind of

2291
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,179
where do you have debates about social

2292
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:48,119
mix about the need to gentrify

2293
01:50:48,119 --> 01:50:51,080
neighborhoods well only in certain

2294
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:56,360
in a limited amount is disadvantages

2295
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:59,400
so I think this rare question is an

2296
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:02,820
important one where are we interested to

2297
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:04,199
create the solutions

2298
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:06,000
you will notice that these discussions

2299
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,820
focus on a very limited number of paper

2300
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:11,699
you know the issue is never discussed in

2301
01:51:11,699 --> 01:51:15,119
other parts of the city

2302
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:18,420
it's also important to look at the issue

2303
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:21,840
of scaling I already discussed that but

2304
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,540
here again many of our Maps only focus

2305
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:26,580
on Antwerp or the Brussels capital

2306
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:29,159
region while I've told you that many of

2307
01:51:29,159 --> 01:51:31,440
these quarterback effects

2308
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:34,020
have consequences in other parts of the

2309
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,360
urban region or even other parts of the

2310
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:39,239
country if housing prices in Brussels go

2311
01:51:39,239 --> 01:51:43,080
out business effects inshallahua this

2312
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:46,500
makes us walking around in Machinery to

2313
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,239
see the property there

2314
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:51,260
okay or we go to Chrome search

2315
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:54,300
in French quite far away from Brussels

2316
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,860
effect

2317
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:58,860
s or Nino over leading it yeah all these

2318
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:01,739
municipalities are affected by this

2319
01:52:01,739 --> 01:52:03,420
gentrification of

2320
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:05,159
us and so it's important that we discuss

2321
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:08,159
this issue at the scale of

2322
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:12,199
at least the urban region

2323
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,900
so for whom in whose interest do we want

2324
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:18,719
to create social mix where

2325
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,460
so you want to do that which

2326
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:22,260
neighborhoods are we actually talking

2327
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,219
about

2328
01:52:23,219 --> 01:52:25,440
and then I think it's also important to

2329
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,020
focus on this why question

2330
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:30,480
if you want to create a social gifts to

2331
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,520
counter poverty

2332
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,219
or even to stimulate this cultural

2333
01:52:35,219 --> 01:52:37,920
integration and I think that there might

2334
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:41,760
be many policy Alternatives which are

2335
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:42,840
less

2336
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:46,139
costly and which may have much bigger

2337
01:52:46,139 --> 01:52:48,300
effects

2338
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:50,340
yeah I'm not going to go too much into

2339
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:53,820
this but you can imagine that you can

2340
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:57,659
try to combat poverty not through the

2341
01:52:57,659 --> 01:52:59,880
spatial intervention

2342
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:03,900
but through other accounts social

2343
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:07,280
welfare Etc

2344
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:10,560
is it to improve the local Tech space

2345
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,540
we've seen this quote from this elder

2346
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:15,060
man of cats and I think for many Belgian

2347
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:17,159
cities this will be an important one why

2348
01:53:17,159 --> 01:53:21,000
do we find gentrification importance

2349
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,300
yeah and why do we want to attract the

2350
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:27,179
middle class to the city it is because

2351
01:53:27,179 --> 01:53:30,480
that is good for our Municipal budget

2352
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:33,300
yeah but then even then I will always

2353
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:35,820
eat this rhetoric of this is in the

2354
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:38,699
interest of the people that included and

2355
01:53:38,699 --> 01:53:40,920
this will eventually help them to find

2356
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:43,560
the social media

2357
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:46,800
create social mix to counter racist or

2358
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:50,880
classes stereotypes what would that mean

2359
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,360
I guess that would mean that we would

2360
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:57,179
rethink where and for whom we try to

2361
01:53:57,179 --> 01:54:00,179
create a social mix and you see that in

2362
01:54:00,179 --> 01:54:02,940
most of the policy discourse this is

2363
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:05,280
quite absent

2364
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:09,060
however if stigmatization is one of the

2365
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:14,179
reasons why living in modern day

2366
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:17,639
makes your life more difficult than

2367
01:54:17,639 --> 01:54:20,520
other parts of the city but it is about

2368
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:23,159
stigmatization and discrimination and

2369
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:25,800
what kind of spatial interventions that

2370
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,719
would be needed to counter these

2371
01:54:27,719 --> 01:54:29,659
stereotypes I think you would create

2372
01:54:29,659 --> 01:54:33,119
social media completely and different

2373
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:34,739
way

2374
01:54:34,739 --> 01:54:38,460
so this is a bit of an open-ended

2375
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:39,139
um

2376
01:54:39,139 --> 01:54:43,320
conclusion with a lot of questions but I

2377
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:44,460
hope that

2378
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:47,580
by giving you Arguments for social mix

2379
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:50,280
and counter arguments guests

2380
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:53,400
and by encouraging you to think about

2381
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,139
the context

2382
01:54:55,139 --> 01:54:58,500
in which you want to create a social mix

2383
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,719
or not that you are able to think

2384
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:03,960
critically about the effects of

2385
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:07,080
segregation and the needs to create a

2386
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:09,300
social mix or launch

2387
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,760
yeah

2388
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,480
um five plus seven I propose that

2389
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:19,619
um we almost leave it here for now we

2390
01:55:19,619 --> 01:55:21,719
still have time to discuss all these

2391
01:55:21,719 --> 01:55:25,199
issues next week in the seminar all

2392
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:27,360
these texts will deal again with

2393
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:30,179
patterns of segregation and the effects

2394
01:55:30,179 --> 01:55:32,940
of saying so I think it's good that we

2395
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:35,520
have time to discuss this

2396
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:39,119
next week Monday for the geographers

2397
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:42,480
and the people from planning and have

2398
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:45,060
awesome students is this information

2399
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:46,980
correct

2400
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:49,860
next week Monday we have eight

2401
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:53,639
papers eight presentations to discuss

2402
01:55:53,639 --> 01:55:55,400
I don't see any

2403
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:57,900
comments so I suppose that this is the

2404
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,360
schedule as it is and then next week

2405
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:04,580
Tuesday and Thursday we have two other

2406
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:08,760
seminars for students from moose

2407
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:13,320
and Thursday students from four cities

2408
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:16,020
yeah is that correct

2409
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:19,739
yes all your presentations are there you

2410
01:56:19,739 --> 01:56:22,580
find your names

2411
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:27,020
this is the information

2412
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:30,300
10 minutes

2413
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:33,420
and we will I will need to be rather

2414
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:36,560
um strict which is 10 minutes

2415
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,400
maximum

2416
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,179
especially having AIDS presentations in

2417
01:56:42,179 --> 01:56:45,420
the first seminar but also in the other

2418
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:51,719
seminars I prefer to uh keep the time

2419
01:56:51,719 --> 01:56:55,020
and to limit these presentations to 10

2420
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,639
minutes because otherwise there's not

2421
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,739
enough time for discussion these are

2422
01:56:58,739 --> 01:57:01,619
discussion seminars not presentations

2423
01:57:01,619 --> 01:57:03,840
so limit your presentations to 10

2424
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:07,020
minutes include a slide with title names

2425
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,659
email I don't know all of you so it's

2426
01:57:09,659 --> 01:57:12,060
important that I'm able to mark the

2427
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:14,040
presentations to connect this with the

2428
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:16,800
right students remember that I need a

2429
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:19,679
core court or arguments a link with the

2430
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:21,480
required readings

2431
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:24,000
remember that we also expect all

2432
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,840
students who have read all the papers of

2433
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,400
the required readings

2434
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:31,980
so I'm supposed that Slater has been

2435
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:35,520
read by Kevin Olsen and preserve and the

2436
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:38,280
textbook a chapter like what's your name

2437
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,860
and then important

2438
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:44,960
in order to not to lose too much time

2439
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,780
with technical issues I would like all

2440
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:51,360
of you to send your PowerPoints or ETF

2441
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,159
or whatever you're going to use to

2442
01:57:53,159 --> 01:57:56,099
support your presentation at least 30

2443
01:57:56,099 --> 01:57:59,340
minutes before the seminar to my email

2444
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:00,360
address

2445
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:03,239
whether we transfer link if necessary

2446
01:58:03,239 --> 01:58:06,239
and if you want me to check with the

2447
01:58:06,239 --> 01:58:10,460
presentation works on my computer

2448
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:13,800
then I suggest you to do that maybe

2449
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:16,679
already the evening before and then ask

2450
01:58:16,679 --> 01:58:19,020
me maybe check whether the PowerPoint

2451
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:22,139
approach or do it in a PDF so that's the

2452
01:58:22,139 --> 01:58:24,360
different PowerPoint versions things may

2453
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:26,599
change

2454
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:29,520
but please send them before the

2455
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:32,420
presentation so that I have the time

2456
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:37,520
so let me know whose time with swapping

2457
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:40,099
laptops and

2458
01:58:40,099 --> 01:58:42,679
laptops that can't make the connection

2459
01:58:42,679 --> 01:58:46,580
with the screen Etc

2460
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,139
just to make sure that we are all able

2461
01:58:49,139 --> 01:58:51,599
to present and that we have time to

2462
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:53,699
receivers and that will also allow us to

2463
01:58:53,699 --> 01:58:57,360
discuss everything that has been said

2464
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:00,679
and last decision

2465
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:03,239
okay then I would look forward to see

2466
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:05,110
you next week

2467
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:08,210
[Music]

2468
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:32,599
all right

2469
01:59:49,639 --> 01:59:53,300
this is so stupid

2470
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:02,360
not talking about questions

2471
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:06,060
foreign

2472
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:38,420
thank you

2473
02:01:11,179 --> 02:01:14,239
thank you

2474
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:29,580
again

2475
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:42,599
yes I

2476
02:01:42,599 --> 02:01:45,599
like bye

2477
02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:56,540
yes and yes

2478
02:01:58,830 --> 02:02:01,920
[Music]

2479
02:02:02,179 --> 02:02:05,179
when the first version

2480
02:02:05,179 --> 02:02:07,440
yes and then these people have been

2481
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:12,420
added to the list yes

2482
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:26,880
maybe there could be a way

2483
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:29,360
that yeah

2484
02:02:30,540 --> 02:02:34,560
if not for next week then for

2485
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:37,199
what would you prefer to do it

2486
02:02:37,199 --> 02:02:40,199
but

2487
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:51,260
yeah because now it's hard for me

2488
02:02:56,580 --> 02:02:58,220
okay yeah

2489
02:02:58,220 --> 02:03:01,329
[Music]

2490
02:03:10,619 --> 02:03:12,980
yeah

2491
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,400
I've done it next week so it's

2492
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:20,400
foreign

2493
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:46,210
[Music]

2494
02:03:52,199 --> 02:03:54,739
sure

2495
02:04:08,099 --> 02:04:12,179
so the first thing is can we call like

2496
02:04:12,179 --> 02:04:14,760
any project that things to attract

2497
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:18,480
investment or hence the apology of life

2498
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:22,139
in a neighborhood like this uh doing a

2499
02:04:22,139 --> 02:04:25,560
taxi and this kind of products can we

2500
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:28,260
call they are social mix projects

2501
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:31,260
because

2502
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,540
that's 100

2503
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,219
you still have a project

2504
02:04:44,219 --> 02:04:46,139
improve

2505
02:04:46,139 --> 02:04:49,099
public spaces

2506
02:04:58,139 --> 02:05:01,619
so like do they say that they are social

2507
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:04,440
based projects like openly

2508
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:07,260
so in some of these I've shown you some

2509
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:11,659
some parts from policy games

2510
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:17,520
okay

2511
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:20,159
in order to attract another kind of

2512
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:21,900
presence

2513
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:24,320
yes

2514
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,619
do you have any other if you have

2515
02:05:34,619 --> 02:05:37,679
already used some references that talk

2516
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:39,980
about Brussels

2517
02:05:39,980 --> 02:05:42,540
in the presentation I haven't shown that

2518
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:43,440
but

2519
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,659
there is quite a rich people Geography

2520
02:05:45,659 --> 02:05:48,599
okay so it finally shows papers I will

2521
02:05:48,599 --> 02:05:50,099
find something well I think you will

2522
02:05:50,099 --> 02:05:52,380
find a lot of women who benefits from

2523
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:54,179
home ownership support policies in

2524
02:05:54,179 --> 02:05:55,980
Brussels that's where this this quote

2525
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:58,280
comes from

2526
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:00,840
clicking and moving in out of Brussels

2527
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:03,540
much of his work is on gentrification

2528
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:05,159
but you will also see that some of his

2529
02:06:05,159 --> 02:06:06,599
papers deal with

2530
02:06:06,599 --> 02:06:09,060
social mix in relation to uh

2531
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:12,179
gentrification specifically so there's a

2532
02:06:12,179 --> 02:06:14,420
lot of work

2533
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:17,099
yeah from here

2534
02:06:17,099 --> 02:06:19,619
uh and the other thing that I don't know

2535
02:06:19,619 --> 02:06:21,179
if I'm mistaken but I have the

2536
02:06:21,179 --> 02:06:23,940
impression that there is not actually

2537
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:27,420
evidence that social actually works like

2538
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:30,060
you presented some arguments

2539
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:32,760
but they're not

2540
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,880
recorded life is

2541
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:38,940
more like suppositions and

2542
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:42,900
well I think the infamous

2543
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:46,400
trying to find out the

2544
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,960
effects and and showing that there are

2545
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:51,119
some cases where

2546
02:06:51,119 --> 02:06:53,219
people might benefit from such things

2547
02:06:53,219 --> 02:06:56,420
but even any questions

2548
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:01,560
mixed neighborhood so it's quite costly

2549
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:04,219
yes what would happen

2550
02:07:04,219 --> 02:07:07,560
the structural problems if you reduce

2551
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:09,360
all this money to

2552
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,440
try and comment over

2553
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:14,820
again so even

2554
02:07:14,820 --> 02:07:19,159
turns out social response

2555
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:26,580
just yeah so so even even if you could

2556
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:29,760
turn out that by creating social mix you

2557
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:31,440
improve

2558
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,719
the situation

2559
02:07:33,719 --> 02:07:36,780
any questions that is what would happen

2560
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:37,800
so

2561
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:40,320
it should try and attack it

2562
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:43,820
it's not through spatial

2563
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:47,699
we're trying to okay

2564
02:07:47,699 --> 02:07:50,599
yes

2565
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,800
thank you

2566
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:58,800
improving schools

2567
02:08:05,179 --> 02:08:07,980
we have also time to discuss next next

2568
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:10,760
yes

2569
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:19,609
[Applause]

2570

good evening this certainly is my

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,360
favorite time of the day to teach teach

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,360
a course at 5 PM after every start at 8

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,460
A.M so anyways uh welcome to Urban

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,500
social geography or urban geography

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,660
depending on your exact type of

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,600
enrollment I am boss van Hur for those

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,940
who don't know me yet and I'll be your

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,500
let's say your lecturer for today's

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,559
session and next week's session

17
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,960
um for some reason because I was I had

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,700
started a web stream on panopto but for

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,380
some reason I was I'm receiving emails

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,320
from Individual students asking for

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,299
permission to gain access to the panopto

22
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,360
webstream I gave everyone

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,920
access access until a minute ago now

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,140
I'll stop so because I have to teach at

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,340
some point

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,780
um so if you receive let's say messages

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,400
from your fellow students who cannot

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,960
attend the reason is that they arrived

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,720
after five past five and I need to get

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,700
started but if all goes well the

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,560
recording will be recorded and uploaded

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,299
it went wrong in the previous lecture

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,799
today because I've been up to technical

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,740
difficulties but hopefully we'll manage

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,619
to day I might close the window at some

36
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,500
point but it might help to get some

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,780
oxygen in here so feel free to also open

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,680
windows at the end if you prefer

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,380
um welcome so two sessions

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,600
um as with some other course we run

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,759
especially the big introductory Master

42
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,979
Level courses

43
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,600
um Urban social geography urban

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,939
geography is a thematic course so it

45
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,140
tries to give you an insight into

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,660
different let's say teams around let's

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,280
say concerning let's say different takes

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,099
on Urban Geography I would personally

49
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,319
prefer to call this course Urban Theory

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,300
yeah because I think we do more than

51
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,819
just geography but the basic idea is to

52
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,560
give different conceptual analytical

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,260
perspectives on how to how to study or

54
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,000
how we can study Europe

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,920
my role

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,500
in this in this course and I guess also

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,080
in my own research specialty is I'm the

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
cultural guy so I I tend to focus on

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,459
more cultural issues uh so I'll be

60
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,900
talking you through

61
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,660
both today and next week Monday July say

62
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,280
cultural approaches to studying the

63
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,420
urban

64
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,340
um today's session oops here we are

65
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,560
today's session is really you see a

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,599
historical overview

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,819
um in the sense that I want to go

68
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,620
through some discussions which you might

69
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,040
know uh or either let's say in generic

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,340
terms or relatively specifically around

71
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,040
let's see how let's say uh thinking

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,900
about let's say cultural approach

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,340
towards the urban has been informed

74
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,900
let's say historically speaking so I'm

75
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,159
going to go through a number of let's

76
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,800
say historical steps mainly focusing on

77
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,180
let's say the impact that sort of the

78
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,800
thinking about the post-modern Assad

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,019
this seems like old hats seems like old

80
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,819
information it's it's certainly a debate

81
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,040
that is not used with this kind of

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,560
terminology except maybe unless a

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,940
journalistic media but certainly not

84
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,400
academically asking speaks in the last

85
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
10 years I wouldn't say that people's

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,879
modern has been the main Obsession for

87
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,159
for let's say for research but I would

88
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,540
argue that much of what has been

89
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,900
discussed from the 1980s onwards more or

90
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,720
less around the postmodern as already is

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,400
still being let's say dealt with

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,140
although using a different vocabulary

93
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,420
yeah this is what you will often see is

94
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,640
that the terminology terminologies might

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,280
change but if you open adapt in more

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,840
historical lands you will see the summit

97
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,340
even though the terminologies have

98
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,680
changed then let's see the underlying on

99
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,019
uh let's say content or the substance

100
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,540
that's behind terminology as we made the

101
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,519
same over many many years so not

102
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,379
everything is new even though you use a

103
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,599
new terminology so today is a more

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,920
historical session you can see on

105
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,220
historical historic sized approach

106
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,079
next week it's I mean rather generically

107
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,060
called Urban cultures but there I want

108
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,320
to sort of give you a number of

109
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,000
perspectives let's say on or let's say

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,680
what could temporary approaches towards

111
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,500
studying uh the urban from a cultural

112
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,360
perspective

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,520
um I will not give a definition of

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,400
culture I mean I'm not I mean so it does

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,860
that's it's a lost it's a lost task it's

116
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,960
not going to work I'm also not going to

117
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,759
give a definition let's say media

118
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,259
Scholars are not going to give a

119
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,080
definition on what media is still they

120
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,720
do interesting research but please keep

121
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,759
in mind that one of my aims here is also

122
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,580
to if you decide to adopt a cultural

123
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,620
approach please be very clear and

124
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,300
specify and unpacking and

125
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,220
operationalizing your use of terminology

126
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,139
because it can mean so many different

127
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,820
things yeah so you have to be quite

128
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,040
specific and hopefully my lessons will

129
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,080
help with bits to give you let's say an

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
insight into the different layers or

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,040
different let's say let's say lines of

132
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,080
research that exist and that all use the

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,540
terminology around around culture so

134
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,860
that's what I'm going to try let's say

135
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,220
to bring across uh today

136
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,199
so this is basically the structure of

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,600
today's session let's see how far we get

138
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,300
it's always unpredictable with slides

139
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,340
and then mood of the day and questions

140
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,840
of students Etc

141
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,300
but first I want to start with a very

142
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,340
let's see setting the scene focusing on

143
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,080
the cultural turn the humanities and the

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,800
social sciences I assume most of you

145
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,780
will more or less know what the cultural

146
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,000
Authority Humanity social sciences is so

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,620
we'll not discuss this in depth yeah

148
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,180
there are many many books written on

149
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,160
this again it's a debate I think that is

150
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,240
more or less

151
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,460
not finished but it has been let's say

152
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,800
many of the debates we've had when

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,539
discussing the cultural term Humanity

154
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,039
social sciences have now and we've been

155
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,620
internalized in everyday research so in

156
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,539
that sense it has become well

157
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,720
naturalized in in in very literal sense

158
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,400
so that's the first part very much

159
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,500
setting to see second part I want to

160
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,380
talk to you about post-modernism and the

161
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,259
city there I will mainly focus on the

162
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,360
work of Frederick Jameson not because I

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
think that he's the only one who has

164
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,300
written on postmodernism in the city

165
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,759
he's not even an urban scholar per se he

166
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,259
actually comes from literary studies and

167
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,600
philosophy but his work is thinking

168
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,180
about this has been very influential

169
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,259
especially because it has been picked up

170
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,259
by Urban Scholars at a later stage

171
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,300
among which the Los Angeles School of

172
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,880
urbanism which is the third section the

173
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,580
third part of today's lecture because

174
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,020
they really have worked you could say

175
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,699
with this with this idea of the

176
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,680
postmodern and the city and have

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,960
proposed new ways of studying this city

178
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,000
as we will see not everything that you

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,520
have proposed uh was as new as they have

180
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,919
claimed but still that it has been quite

181
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,440
a foundational moment for for the study

182
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,180
of the urban for urban studies at large

183
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,520
to close sorry now not too close then

184
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,340
there's a fourth section which adopts

185
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,440
was it continues partially underwater

186
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,080
School of urbanism did but really sort

187
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,000
of broadens and broadens the debate and

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,240
has perhaps been more influential also

189
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,440
and this is literature that's usually

190
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,960
summarized or with terminologies around

191
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,660
Urban Landscapes or the symbolic economy

192
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,099
yeah these are terms that you see

193
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,319
popping up especially from the mid 90s

194
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,740
90s early 2000s onwards and that is

195
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,199
still very influential in in our

196
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,120
thinking on on the city and culture

197
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,620
today

198
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,960
um very last part I will discuss this

199
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,419
today or I'll pick this up tomorrow uh

200
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,060
it's what I call meeting halfway uh

201
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,039
Urban anthropology cultural studies and

202
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,500
the spatial turn my entry point in

203
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,660
discussing the urban that's in and the

204
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,300
cultural culture is trulicity spatial

205
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,220
and geography as a discipline whatever

206
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,680
discipline it might be but let's say

207
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,960
parallel debates going on and what we've

208
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,380
seen from the May 1980s 1990s onwards is

209
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,139
that let's say some of the concerns that

210
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,599
are geography or economic geography or

211
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,240
Human Geography at large has had really

212
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,819
started influencing other debates at the

213
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,620
same time as human geographies started

214
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,780
engaging more or let's say actively more

215
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,360
assertively with other disciplines there

216
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,740
are many many disciplines that could be

217
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,539
that could be let's say

218
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,759
mentioned here but for me some of the

219
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,440
more influential ones are anthropology

220
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,020
Urban anthropology and cultural studies

221
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,259
yeah so where geography start engaging

222
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,960
more with questions around and let's see

223
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,080
questions traditionally uh discussed in

224
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
anthropology or in cultural studies

225
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,740
cultural studies then topology also

226
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,360
started engaging more with less of the

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,880
spatial concerns of geography so this is

228
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,740
something that I will close to this

229
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,680
lecture it or open next week lecture and

230
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,580
now I'm going to close the window

231
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,880
because

232
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,260
hear the difference

233
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,600
is one reminder I have a habit of

234
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,019
talking fast so if I talk too fast just

235
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,440
raise your hands yeah this is I have the

236
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,779
very strange habit of talking faster in

237
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,279
English than I do in Dutch which would

238
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,019
be my mother tongue

239
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,880
um don't ask me why if you ask me to

240
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,500
speak German I'll still slow down but

241
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,959
that wouldn't help for let's say General

242
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,440
comprehension in this class I think okay

243
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,440
first part cultural turn or cultural

244
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,880
turns

245
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,959
um

246
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
the slides are all uploaded so in that

247
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,740
sense you don't have to sort of type

248
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,019
like crazy just try to focus on the main

249
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,120
uh the main elements and try to go the

250
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,860
flow of the argument and trying to

251
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,120
develop

252
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,740
some of you will notice some of you will

253
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,600
not it really depends a bit I think on

254
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,820
your on your educational background yeah

255
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,200
I would assume that those were the

256
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,820
social sciences especially Humanity

257
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,740
backgrounds will be more familiar with

258
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,480
this debate than those let's say coming

259
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,220
from an engineering background but it

260
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,320
much depends a bit on the specificities

261
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,540
also which countries you have studied

262
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,000
so some take-home messages what is the

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
cultural term the cultural terms it's

264
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,839
part of a wider shift since I would

265
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,320
argue the late 1970s at least since this

266
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
period that it was phrased as such in

267
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,279
research practices in Humanities and

268
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,500
social sciences yeah so there are

269
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,300
various interrelated claims so that's

270
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,279
why I talk about cultural turns in a way

271
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,560
because it's not that easy to identify

272
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,560
one single shift in research practices

273
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,100
one is empirical and that simply argues

274
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,740
well simply argues culture is becoming

275
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,720
increasingly important in advanced

276
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,060
societies Advanced societies being a

277
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,560
code word for Western Europe and North

278
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,600
America basically yeah so

279
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,700
knowledge-based sites Advanced societies

280
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,740
post-industrial societies whatever term

281
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,079
you prefer so this is the first claim

282
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,660
being made as to why there is and or

283
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,120
should be a cultural term yeah culture

284
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,579
is simply becoming more important

285
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,380
um and you've opened the question what

286
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,300
Dan is culture about let's just assume

287
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,480
that it refers to the arts film media

288
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
whatever right so adult should become

289
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,720
more important

290
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,600
this relates to a second's plane which

291
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
is theoretical

292
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,060
we need better theories to grasp better

293
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,839
cultural dimensions of the social yeah

294
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,579
referring usually to symbols effects

295
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,339
meaning making practices yeah

296
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,500
the one that doesn't necessarily relate

297
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,180
to the second principle you could have

298
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,100
no change let's say an empirical

299
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,079
phenomena but simply saying well but you

300
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,760
really understand these old phenomena

301
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,760
better we need theories that capture

302
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,760
this the culturals let's say dimensions

303
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,040
of this phenomena better yeah but

304
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,240
obviously when we talk about the

305
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,740
cultural turn often this comes together

306
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,140
we say Okay culture is becoming more

307
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,360
important empirically and in order to

308
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,860
really understand this better we also

309
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,240
need other theories because the theories

310
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
we have don't really capture this quite

311
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,420
well you know so that's the tech

312
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,480
influence the third Point again of

313
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,579
course related with methodological

314
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,740
if this is the case or also respective

315
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,959
of this we need new methods to better

316
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,839
interpret different empirical data and

317
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,079
or to interpret data differently yeah so

318
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,120
either the old data in a different way

319
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,160
or to interpret it better or to

320
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,200
interpret data differently so it's a

321
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
time to interpret new data uh that we

322
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,740
need different methods for this yeah

323
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,839
maybe the simplest example in the

324
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,760
current setting would be if you look at

325
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,920
the rise of social media and let's say

326
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,380
data data skills for example and let's

327
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,480
say the last 10 years it's obviously a

328
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,220
new methods have also Arisen in order to

329
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,200
be able to investigate these phenomena

330
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
so there's a Classics as a

331
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,440
straightforward example of how a new

332
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,920
phenomena has emerged as a society-wide

333
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,220
and we're not always able to capture it

334
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,839
with the same methods that we had before

335
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,519
so you might need different skills

336
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,920
different methods yeah I mean again

337
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,899
question mark not saying this is the

338
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,399
case but this is let's say the argument

339
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,320
is put forward because obviously with

340
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,880
let's see existing methods you can still

341
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,760
do quite quite a lot or maybe they're

342
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,639
tweaking them so that's um important key

343
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,440
in mind so that's the clay but it also

344
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,399
means you have to be let's say

345
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,860
self-reflex appear because a lot of this

346
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,079
involves let's see claims about the

347
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,480
cultural turn does things better yeah

348
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,980
but then of course you always have to

349
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,540
ask yourself okay but better compared to

350
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,339
what right there's often a kind of

351
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,320
simplification of disciplinary histories

352
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,820
because that we say let's say within

353
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,880
urban geography it's a Well we need to

354
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
cultural turn because we need more

355
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,660
qualitative matters before all these old

356
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,880
guys just did quantitative methods yeah

357
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,860
it's just the data crunching this is not

358
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,720
what we need we need to do new matters

359
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,519
and there's like yeah if you look

360
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,500
superficially at that history that might

361
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,600
be the case but if you look more closely

362
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,980
you will see all kinds of different

363
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,019
strands in let's say the 100 or more

364
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,839
than 100 Years of urban studies research

365
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,180
that actually come very close to some of

366
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,639
the claims here made here yeah so that's

367
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,139
the ethnographic research for example

368
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,540
took place before but it's the same so

369
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,459
it really leads to a simplification of

370
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,380
often that's a disciplinary histories

371
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,139
and you need to be quite quite careful

372
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,940
the same arguments around let's say the

373
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,320
industrial and the post-industrial the

374
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,880
post-industrial is not completely new no

375
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,860
but it tends to actually foreground

376
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,500
different trends that might have existed

377
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,019
at a previous phase also but in a last

378
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,940
not in a sense of dominance so this is

379
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,899
important to keep in mind

380
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,579
yes

381
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,959
I don't hear anything sorry

382
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,380
what's your question

383
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,139
I'm afraid because I don't see it

384
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,399
I can have a go on this one but

385
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,360
only I don't have the problem with not

386
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,279
speaking loud enough but I'll see let me

387
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,420
see

388
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,579
yeah the building is awful is

389
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,440
building works also yeah

390
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,120
see I don't hear anything what you're

391
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,920
saying

392
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,920
check

393
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,380
if you're going to dream this morning

394
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,940
last year has all worked quite well but

395
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,320
everything slowly everything is falling

396
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,339
apart give it one year

397
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,959
because there's also not much I can

398
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,620
actually do here

399
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,940
it's all on that but you won't hear me

400
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,779
will you

401
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,779
yeah

402
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,680
and it's awesome I'm afraid this is not

403
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,860
working

404
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,360
thank you

405
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,199
no sorry I could do about it all right

406
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,959
I'll try to speak a bit louder and a bit

407
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,579
slower but there's nothing I can do

408
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,079
about the building usually buildings are

409
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,820
installing five yeah I mean what the

410
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,959
hell anyways

411
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,480
um

412
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,540
so these are some of the main shifts

413
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,040
that you should understand as being part

414
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,839
of let's say the cultural term the

415
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,480
cultural Turks yes just to give you some

416
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,420
quick examples of let's say uh offers

417
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,760
the foundational books that that might

418
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,220
act as a reference reference of let's

419
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,500
say exemplifying the cultural turn

420
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,339
this is getting better yeah so

421
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,320
exemplifying the cultural turn

422
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,660
yes

423
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,800
I'm wondering how people look on this at

424
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,060
panopto they don't understand anything

425
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,820
of this so anyways

426
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,660
um

427
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,519
Frederick Jameson coming from literary

428
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,320
cultural Theory who I will discuss in

429
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,420
some detail precisely because some of

430
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,699
his elements uh some of his arguments

431
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,440
are let's say really foundational thing

432
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,079
for much of urban studies in this

433
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,360
particular strand of research but you

434
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,860
see it also political science and

435
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,380
historical sociology stage formation

436
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,779
after the cultural turn uh really

437
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:44,100
looking at you could say meaning making

438
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,740
practices State imaginary some terms

439
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,079
that maybe now have become quiet

440
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,380
let's see natural really uh to to think

441
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,899
about what the state is but perhaps from

442
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,060
let's say an earlier institutional point

443
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,220
of view we're not so much the case yeah

444
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,420
so

445
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,160
and as you see many of these claims were

446
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
made or cultural and economy after the

447
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,140
cultural turn yeah

448
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,319
foreign

449
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,939
but it really doesn't help for the

450
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,079
Acoustics right

451
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,419
so looking at organizations much more

452
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,339
from a cultural perspective that is not

453
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,260
just about the organization and let's

454
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,299
say a functional manner but also about

455
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,059
again meeting making practices ways of

456
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:28,679
Behaving uh within organizations

457
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,140
um anthropology and history history

458
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,540
sociology Etc you could name many many

459
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,520
of these books but they all at that

460
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,620
point in time and it was all around late

461
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,500
1980s throughout the 1990s that these

462
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,000
kinds of claims were made most

463
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,260
forcefully in in academic literature

464
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,320
now to Frederick Jameson every year wait

465
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,000
it sounds a bit harsh but every year I

466
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,559
have to check online if he's not that

467
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,280
yet because he was born in 1934-4 but I

468
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,960
don't think he's that active anymore but

469
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,340
he would think he was pretty active

470
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,960
until five to ten years ago which in

471
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,539
itself uh is quite achievement he has

472
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,160
published an enormous amount of books

473
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,179
and articles

474
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,360
uh is a professor or Emeritus professor

475
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,340
of comparative literature at Duke

476
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,400
University and has become I'll put I

477
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,559
just put some passwords here has become

478
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,240
very famous for Marxist literary

479
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,640
cultural theory for debates obviously on

480
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,820
around modernity and post-modernity and

481
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,320
also for the relation to culture and

482
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,500
political economy so if these buzzwords

483
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,640
should already give a bit of an

484
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,860
explanation let's ask them how he

485
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,539
interprets culture because he has a

486
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,640
strong you see Marxist but in a very

487
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,620
let's see open manner but especially

488
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,539
this is important so he always looks at

489
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,100
the relation of culture to political

490
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,260
economy which is basically a code word

491
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,360
for capitalism yeah so this is I would

492
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,480
say I would say his main concern in his

493
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,820
writings at least on on culture and

494
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,600
postmodernism

495
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,520
now there's a phrase that has become

496
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,020
well this is also his article originally

497
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,740
published in 1984.

498
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,760
which he died which he titled

499
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,160
post-modernism as the cultural logic of

500
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,620
late capitalism yeah so this is really

501
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,179
let's say a phrase that has become very

502
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,480
famous also you see it referred to

503
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,299
um on a regular basis now there are a

504
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,740
number of elements I don't know who has

505
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,240
wrapped to the article I'm not going to

506
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,740
ask I'm not even going to ask who has

507
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,120
actually managed to finish the article

508
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,100
because it's not a simple article I am

509
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,320
very well aware of this

510
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,480
um it is worth it I mean have a drink

511
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,059
sit down late evening and you'll maybe

512
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,400
understand it better uh

513
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,080
who knows

514
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,080
um but it really is uh I'm I'm trying to

515
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,220
give you also let's say some

516
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,840
foundational original literatures not

517
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
just about secondary literature artists

518
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,740
writing about other artists but this is

519
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,500
the is a is an article related to book

520
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,780
that is let's say it's referenced all

521
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,580
the time so it really helps to go back

522
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,799
to the original uh to get a sense of

523
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,500
what is arguing now I picked to do your

524
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,900
homework I picked some as a key quotes

525
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,299
from from this article which in a way

526
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,220
give a good summary of what this claim

527
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,960
is about and which shaped I think some

528
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,140
of the urban research later on

529
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,299
first he says of course modernism is not

530
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,120
a style but it acts or it is a cultural

531
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,799
dominant yeah

532
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,080
so it's not just a lifestyle question no

533
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,460
it's actually something that has become

534
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,220
dominant in our contemporary culture

535
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,419
second

536
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,039
and directly related aesthetic

537
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
production today and this is of course

538
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,640
where let's see it's Marxist on as the

539
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,340
political economy sympathies show a

540
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,200
static production today has become

541
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,140
integrated into commodity production uh

542
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,780
generally yeah so it's really difficult

543
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,660
he argues to distinguish aesthetic

544
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,059
production and production of the Arts

545
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,520
symbolic entities from Commodities yeah

546
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,620
so it basically becomes one two sides of

547
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,000
the same coin that's basically what

548
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,340
she's arguing yeah I think if you start

549
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,039
thinking empirically it's quite easy to

550
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,299
come up with concrete example of

551
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,679
anything oh yeah that makes a lot of

552
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,080
sense yeah a work of art let's see a

553
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,020
painting is at the same time let's say

554
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,559
aesthetic production yeah it's about

555
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,640
symbolic and meaning making practices

556
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,100
yes about interpretation but it's also

557
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,900
sells on the Art Market yeah and it's

558
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,059
not to do with speculation so it's both

559
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,440
you know

560
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,539
that historic elements

561
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,220
I'll skip this because it's interesting

562
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,559
but there's a very let's say 1980

563
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,840
sentiment where sort of globalization

564
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,580
and Americanization was very much seen

565
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,720
as one of the same thing or

566
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,520
globalization was seen as you could see

567
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,940
an extension uh of an earlier history of

568
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,919
Americanization yeah

569
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,600
and then he talks about it this again

570
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,919
becomes very important I said well

571
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,440
basically he looks at postmodernism as

572
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,620
the third stage of capital capitalism uh

573
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,080
referring to Alice Mandel was a market

574
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,000
scholar actually at this University many

575
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,740
many years ago

576
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,960
um which would then be a uses different

577
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,000
terminologies for it he refers to

578
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,159
post-industrial capitalism because the

579
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,780
base capitalism to multinational

580
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,820
capitalism or to Consumer capitalism

581
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,480
yeah so you could argue this all here is

582
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,480
the politically political economy policy

583
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,260
political economy side of postmodernism

584
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,200
yeah so post-modernism accompanies this

585
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,960
phase of capitalism yeah that also means

586
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,140
according to to Jameson it only makes

587
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,480
sense to talk about postmodernism from

588
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
let's say the mid 1970s onwards there is

589
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,700
no such thing in this way of reasoning

590
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,460
as post-modernism in the 1920s just

591
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,080
doesn't make any sense yeah because it's

592
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,419
so much tied to a particular face or

593
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,799
particular stage of capitalism

594
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,919
one reason why this article has become

595
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,120
quite famous and it's a bit more

596
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,799
difficult to understand now I think is

597
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,080
because he does quite an extensive re uh

598
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,240
reading and interpretation of one

599
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,500
particular hotel which is the

600
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,600
bonaventura hotel

601
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,700
um in Los Angeles

602
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,340
so uh designed by John Portman built in

603
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,860
the mid-1970s and one of the largest

604
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,559
hotels in La and to my knowledge uh it's

605
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,900
it still is

606
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,520
so just some pictures

607
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,919
this this hotel for him it's a bit hard

608
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,280
to imagine now but it's if you look

609
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,419
represents you could say the culmination

610
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,960
of post-modernism as the late logic as

611
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,940
the elastic logic of of late capitalism

612
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,320
so what does he argue here you will see

613
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,000
that some of these elephants return in

614
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,799
later debates without reference to the

615
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,900
hotel or the specificity of his his

616
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,600
argument it aspires to be a total space

617
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,299
a complete world and an attempt to not

618
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,520
be a part of the city yeah so it tends

619
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,580
to be a world on its own yeah

620
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,039
to not be a part of the sea so it has a

621
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,320
reflective glass skin which repels the

622
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,340
city

623
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,799
outside and achieves The Peculiar and

624
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,080
placeless dissociation of the

625
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,140
bonaventura from its neighborhood yeah

626
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,760
just keep this in mind somebody's else

627
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,620
because they will return later yeah but

628
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,360
it is separate from the city so it's

629
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,700
quite a quite easy to imagine later and

630
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,559
I'll give some examples also if you

631
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,360
think of let's say gated community style

632
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,919
things right things that are let's say

633
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,080
within the city but cities are highly

634
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,880
unequal so you have different elements

635
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,919
let's say separate even though they're

636
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,900
formally speaking part of the sea this

637
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,340
is what he's arguing at that this is

638
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,679
what we see in the Bonaventure Hotel and

639
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,600
then this becomes a bit more difficult

640
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,460
to imagine now because it really is I

641
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,860
think an experience of that time I think

642
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,539
we're now so used to these kinds of

643
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:28,799
architectures and these kinds of

644
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,080
buildings but here according to him this

645
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,179
becomes impossible to navigate they have

646
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,539
postmodern hyperspace I'll skip that is

647
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,460
impossible to navigate yeah it's just

648
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,380
too confusing in any way you can no

649
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,080
longer situate yourself as a subject

650
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,419
within this world but you're just very a

651
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,700
very fragmented human being that was a

652
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,620
kind of let's say a typical let's say

653
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,940
literary Trope of 1980s post-modernism I

654
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,700
think this has probably become us

655
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,740
Central to the debate most likely

656
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,539
because we have so we have become so

657
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:05,120
used to behaving like this in the world

658
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,020
again I want to discuss these in detail

659
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,059
I'll skip the first this one might be

660
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,679
important to remember here because again

661
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,780
this shows up and later discussions

662
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,860
especially when we think about

663
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,419
discussions around cultural heritage

664
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,240
yeah his stories isn't a thesis history

665
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,580
a random cannibalization of all the

666
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,919
styles of the past and this idea that

667
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,799
especially post-modern architecture just

668
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,240
use different elements for different

669
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,419
eras and combined us into a new building

670
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,400
yeah so it didn't produce let's say

671
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,740
formally speaking something new but it

672
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,140
was more of Rico large a combination of

673
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,059
all kinds of existing let's say

674
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,279
architectural Styles yeah so a random

675
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,900
categorization of the cells of the past

676
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,120
the past as a reference finds itself

677
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,980
gradually bracketed leaving us nothing

678
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,279
with nothing but text yeah

679
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,200
so this is also again something that

680
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
pops up in later discussions uh on okay

681
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,299
what what do let's say

682
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,260
um

683
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,880
what what does let's say culture

684
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,260
actually produce and there's this idea

685
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,880
that the postmodern that it well we've

686
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,039
actually reached a post-modern phase but

687
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,900
there's no linear trajectory if there

688
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,299
ever was let's say between history and

689
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,400
future it's just a recycling of the past

690
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,000
yeah

691
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,640
okay

692
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,279
now that's Jameson

693
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,919
does that make a bit more sense than

694
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,200
when you read the text

695
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,000
yeah

696
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,620
okay

697
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,299
um

698
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,460
now I mentioned Jameson

699
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,620
um not because I like my old almost dead

700
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,320
white man but um but because he really

701
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,059
has been inspirational I think for many

702
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,620
let's say researchers that came after

703
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,480
from different different perspectives

704
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,000
also yeah the Los Angeles School of

705
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,360
urbanism is one of La cities

706
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,700
um let's see cluster or a cluster of

707
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,380
activity that came together from the mid

708
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,659
1980s onwards and we should also refer

709
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,580
to James in order to build on it in a

710
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,140
more you could say social scientific

711
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,279
Urban research type type of manner

712
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,600
what does the Los Angeles School of

713
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,760
urbanism argue and I'll deconstruct this

714
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,500
idea that it is a career in school but

715
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,380
that is sad to argue

716
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,299
first of all following Jameson literally

717
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,039
following Jameson it looks at the

718
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,039
post-modern condition as a radically new

719
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,380
Urban condition yeah so this is what

720
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,740
they call post-modern urbanism yeah main

721
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,020
characteristics and again be aware of

722
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,340
let's say the simplification of

723
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,799
disciplinary histories because it does

724
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,720
it does have especially in this let's

725
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,500
say

726
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,600
foundational text or a text that try to

727
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,419
let's say really put let's say the LA

728
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,400
School of urbanism on the map through a

729
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,980
number of key Publications it did have a

730
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,240
tendency to then say okay but everything

731
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,940
that came before in a way it was

732
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,919
it's old hat we don't want that we need

733
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,980
something new so yeah very very strong

734
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,740
sense of simplification for some of the

735
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,020
main characteristics self self-defined

736
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,860
Beyond Chicago school what we see now is

737
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,260
not you could say eccentric City but no

738
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,620
it's about Urban fragmentation yeah

739
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,600
it understands LA and Southern

740
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,480
California as privileged cases so the

741
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,580
priority case for doing research but

742
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,740
also as a prototypical case in the sense

743
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,659
that they understood LA and Southern

744
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,600
California as the future of other cities

745
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,940
across the world yeah look at what we

746
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,340
see happening in LA and this region this

747
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,600
is what we will see happening in cities

748
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,640
across the world yeah so it's kind of

749
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,100
three figures let's see future Urban

750
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,220
developments yeah

751
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,480
it paid a lot of attention to

752
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,340
restructuring which was like say the

753
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,559
generic word focusing mostly on

754
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,900
post-forwardism flexible accumulation

755
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,360
the the Redevelopment of firms so I

756
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,679
won't go into this because I think

757
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,960
you're all aware by now of let's say

758
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,799
let's say uh yeah post fordism basically

759
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,779
yeah

760
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,400
um and there's a nice quote from Mike

761
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,360
Davis a writer analytical writer

762
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,700
uh belonging more or less to the same

763
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,100
scene in a way where we talked about the

764
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,480
LA School of urbanless saying well

765
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,980
they're basically politically economists

766
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,020
with their spacesuits on not quite sure

767
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,059
to fully understand what he means it but

768
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,799
it looks really it sounds really nice as

769
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,179
a as a quote

770
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,039
so it gives you a sense it's politically

771
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,659
economy but it's a bit off it's

772
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,100
something else right it's a bit

773
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,820
speculative

774
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,220
foreign

775
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,840
it's important again to be aware of

776
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,700
simplification of disciplinary histories

777
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,279
and it also applies to the LA school as

778
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,640
such yeah so it was all it was soon seen

779
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,220
as a coherent school but it was also

780
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,320
soon critiqued by others and even by

781
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,240
those within working within this domain

782
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,220
or that was let's say label as being

783
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,260
part of the LA School of urbanism saying

784
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,299
well actually there's not one single

785
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,520
claim being made by the LA School of

786
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,200
urbanism but actually there's more

787
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,320
diversity within this supposed school so

788
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,559
there is a diversity within coherence

789
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,360
perhaps so I would argue there are a

790
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,179
number of different lines of research

791
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,919
which in itself have older histories

792
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,020
longer histories but it really came

793
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,120
together at this point in time and I

794
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,940
think it still shapes to some extent uh

795
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,679
to quite a substantial extent here

796
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,659
current research that we are doing today

797
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,600
yeah so one important traps which has

798
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,480
become even the most

799
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,919
famous one is more

800
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,200
political economy economic geography I

801
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,779
guess really looks at postpartism

802
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,399
flexible accumulation industrial

803
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,620
organization Regional development so

804
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,080
really about the transformation of firms

805
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,820
how firms relate to each other how they

806
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,980
connect yeah and what this means for

807
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,260
regional development yeah

808
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,880
let's see the key artist there to

809
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,620
mention of perhaps Alan Scott Susan

810
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,539
Christopherson Michael stalker most of

811
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,700
you will have heard of these names at

812
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,140
least yeah

813
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,820
however there are also other lines of

814
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,740
work one thing I mean this problem is to

815
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,020
some extent most related to First a

816
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,419
political economy of place because if

817
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,620
you look at let's say Regional

818
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,120
development the transformation of

819
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,039
companies there's also an element there

820
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,840
okay what does this mean actually for

821
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,419
let's say local place conditions it has

822
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,220
to do with Place identity but it also

823
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,020
has to do with branding elements it has

824
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,960
to do with let's say local patriotism or

825
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
it has to do with local labor markets

826
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,960
Etc yeah

827
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,240
this that leads to distance strength I

828
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,440
mean they're all related obviously

829
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,539
someone like Jennifer wolf having worked

830
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,520
on homelessness unskilled work local

831
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,100
labor markets a classic argument in this

832
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,500
literature is that the transformation of

833
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,659
of the region as a result of let's say

834
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:43,919
the transformation of its political

835
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,440
economy leads to more polarized labor

836
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,399
markets so we have let's say simplified

837
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:52,320
put in a simplified sense we have let's

838
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,360
see high earners and we have let's say a

839
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,700
very let's see if if not unskilled and

840
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,100
then it gets very low paid and

841
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,200
precariously employed workers on the

842
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,000
bottom so it leads to a more polarized

843
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,340
labor market there's also you think that

844
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,899
has been picked up later by someone like

845
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:09,179
Sasuke assassin working on global cities

846
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,240
yeah so that's important and this wraps

847
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,880
less I mean less famous but but let's

848
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,220
emerge now I think more Force for the

849
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,840
last 10 years is work around

850
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,640
environmental justice yeah the

851
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,140
transformation of the region has also

852
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,659
had effects on the environment at large

853
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:27,480
the planning issues but also uh ecology

854
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,299
issues more narrowly put and this has

855
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,860
already received some attention there

856
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,279
yes

857
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,720
I'll give I'll give some examples I

858
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,700
think later on but basically it's about

859
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,500
Urban fragmentation if I would have to

860
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,760
put it in a bus word so this idea that I

861
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,899
mean especially me for those that

862
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,460
attended my lecture on the European sea

863
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,020
there's this idea that it's a compact

864
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,640
City it's a coherent city is

865
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,159
historically grown and amazing world of

866
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,000
actually

867
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,440
it's a post-modern city it's almost

868
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,600
inverse right it just it's like a

869
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,980
chessboard where whatever you could put

870
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,480
about rationality not a good example

871
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,919
because you know it's a very clear rules

872
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,380
there but when you just like a game

873
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,700
board where you could put wherever you

874
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,260
want and this is how then the city

875
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,840
develops yeah so and this is what and so

876
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,880
this relates to Urban fragmentation and

877
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,919
the other one sprawled I would say say

878
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,899
those would be two issues where they

879
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,299
argue okay this is actually

880
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:34,799
foreshadowing why the urban developments

881
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,480
and they're not completely wrong of

882
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,279
course I would simply I would just argue

883
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,860
that maybe La was not the first and in

884
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,600
parallel at least we saw we see many

885
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,399
other cities where this was also the

886
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,760
case especially uh in the global South

887
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,919
um but this is I mean that's only a

888
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,080
critique that has been raised towards

889
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,480
the LA school also because it's only

890
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,820
only at a later stage I think that it

891
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,620
started looking outside of North America

892
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,860
it was a strong American bias maybe

893
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,960
Western Europe and only later that it

894
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,220
started expanding and then of course

895
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,559
somebody's theories no longer hold or

896
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:11,699
somebody claims in any case yeah yeah

897
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,118
okay

898
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,440
so there's a lot of diversity if you

899
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,239
look at it at the same time it must be

900
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,219
said

901
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:22,020
cumulatively between the mid 1980s and

902
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,659
the mid and the late 1990s various key

903
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,879
Publications were published that put La

904
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,099
really on the map of urban studies yeah

905
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,960
so and this really really helps I think

906
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,679
to to retrospectively look at this as a

907
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,659
kind of coherent La School of urbanism

908
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,599
yeah that's ranging from a 1986 special

909
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,000
issue in society of space which is one

910
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,859
of the few journals specifically

911
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:46,320
dedicated to LA to books like the city

912
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,839
Los Angeles and urban theory in the mid

913
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,440
1990s or rethinking LA

914
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,359
or Studies by Alan J Scott on

915
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,339
technopolis there are many many of these

916
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,020
key books that really appear to the key

917
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,240
references in the field of urban studies

918
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,760
that are still let's say dealt with or

919
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,400
referred to uh today yeah

920
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,280
well for example Mike Mike Davis as I

921
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,920
said what an academic person but his

922
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,200
famous book city of quartz which again

923
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,020
is continuously referenced in many

924
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,720
different uh parts of the urban studies

925
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,339
world and uh and Beyond

926
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,160
this one is perhaps already a partial

927
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,599
answer to your question because this

928
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,200
shows a bit in extreme I would say how

929
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,140
some of these artists looked at at city

930
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,660
development I mean I'm saying in extreme

931
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,980
because this is really an article that

932
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,839
tries to codify some of the claims that

933
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,700
were made in a more subtle manner than

934
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,280
many other orders

935
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,300
um

936
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,280
and by doing said he also radicalized

937
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,020
some of these claims not necessarily in

938
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,380
a in a helpful manner I think but it

939
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,000
helps to keep in mind

940
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,680
so they said they argue that the spatial

941
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,440
manifestation so uh the honest dear and

942
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,240
flusty so I forgot their names

943
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,560
they argue that the spatial

944
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,200
manifestation of post-modern urbanism

945
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,560
was a kind of key no capitalism Yeah so

946
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,359
basically it's apparently a board game I

947
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,160
wasn't aware of that but basically a

948
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,020
very fragmented form of an urban

949
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,260
structure in which the quote

950
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,520
urbanization is occurring on a

951
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,099
quasi-random field of opportunities Yeah

952
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,440
so basically there's no longer this idea

953
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,720
that you have a city center and then it

954
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,460
emerges outwards or there are particular

955
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,280
structures related to planning Etc no it

956
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,920
just it's pretty random yeah

957
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,140
and this is also all of course also the

958
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,760
end of theory because if you make this

959
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,260
kind of claim that does not really much

960
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,140
you can you can do anymore so it's also

961
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,240
highly let's say simplified so I would

962
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,339
certainly not encourage you to

963
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:45,960
understand this as the core business of

964
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,579
the LA School of urbanism this is almost

965
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:51,060
more a parody of the of this debate

966
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,119
nevertheless some of the lesser the

967
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,740
items literally speaking they put on the

968
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,140
map of Keto capitalism

969
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,900
still resonate with us today because for

970
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,540
example we have here at no verb which

971
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,040
you could say there's a lot of which is

972
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,480
still going on on let's say ethnic

973
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,980
communities the relation between ethnic

974
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,900
groups and let's say localities within

975
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,480
cities neighborhoods we have Team marks

976
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,119
parks sorry it's a lot of

977
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,099
commodification of public space we have

978
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,960
created communities with obviously plays

979
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,579
well we have Street Warfare So that

980
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,079
obviously there's violence in the city

981
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,700
which is a classic team in urban

982
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,400
research spectacle again which relates

983
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,220
to let's be commodification of space

984
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,540
command and Patrol centers which is

985
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,400
let's say the classic team Awards like

986
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,260
Sasuke assassin this idea that Global

987
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,359
cities are with where the action happens

988
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,280
when it comes to post-political and

989
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,200
economic rule so all these different

990
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,420
elements do

991
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,180
uh well we're identified by them and

992
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,920
have played an important role in later

993
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,540
research on this city

994
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,700
yeah I give some examples already here I

995
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,800
don't need to go through this again

996
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,619
so much my summary uh of the LA School

997
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,720
of earliest I already hint that the fact

998
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,980
that

999
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,200
this was not without its critique and

1000
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,220
some of this critique was quite

1001
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,200
legitimate because one of let's say my

1002
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,540
hobby was is to really warn against the

1003
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,339
simplification of disciplinary histories

1004
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,500
there's a lot of academic laziness

1005
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,660
involved you want to make a claim that

1006
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,800
you do something relevant and

1007
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,660
interesting and by doing that you say

1008
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,640
about that what came before was actually

1009
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,020
not that interesting but you actually

1010
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,260
simplify that history yeah so if you're

1011
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,180
intellectually I think very honest you

1012
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,859
have to be very careful with these kinds

1013
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,060
of strategies you have to be much more

1014
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,859
or less honest and open and respectful

1015
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,079
also of what came before and maybe

1016
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,880
moderate your own claims to towards new

1017
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,920
illness this is not what the LA school

1018
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,480
did or let's say let's see some artists

1019
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,920
within this field

1020
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,400
so critics were also abundant and all

1021
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,339
very early on raised let's say made

1022
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:56,460
let's say problems had the issues they

1023
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,040
had with let's say the claims of noon is

1024
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,560
put forward by other school Earnest one

1025
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,740
being what's really new here yeah

1026
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,599
you might claim that this is work done

1027
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,160
that hasn't received enough attention

1028
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,079
but actually there's already a lot of

1029
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,599
existing work on diversity restructuring

1030
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,000
consumption and commodification or in

1031
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,800
urban poverty yeah especially Urban

1032
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,400
poverty has been foundational to riding

1033
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,440
on the urban since the mid-19th century

1034
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,820
yeah so there's actually an

1035
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,740
industrialization basically so what's

1036
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,359
really new here

1037
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,720
that's the first legitimate criticism

1038
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,420
second one it is

1039
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,000
the LA school it really sort of reduced

1040
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,560
The Chicago School

1041
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,839
do a kind of Burgess concentric zone

1042
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,300
model the idea that everything that was

1043
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,060
written in the 1930s which is post-hoc

1044
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,240
sometimes labeled as The Chicago School

1045
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,220
was about the concentric zone model this

1046
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,619
idea that as a central central air

1047
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,060
business district and had people move

1048
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,339
outwards depending on let's say history

1049
00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:00,119
and and capital also yeah there's much

1050
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,859
more internal of our or there was much

1051
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,720
more internal variety within the Chicago

1052
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,300
school so it does not justify this kind

1053
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,520
of simplification yeah so many things

1054
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,920
the TLA school is now doing actually was

1055
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,480
already happening in The Chicago School

1056
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,240
so let's say the American claim there's

1057
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,680
of course also a struggle you could say

1058
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,280
within us American Academia saying well

1059
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,920
we've had Chicago now we move to LA this

1060
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,660
is where the action is happening and

1061
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,980
then many other Arts were saying well

1062
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,619
maybe not quite yeah so that's important

1063
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:29,760
to keep in mind

1064
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,119
a third one this perhaps for me the

1065
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,920
most the most interesting or the most

1066
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,280
relevant critique is there is truly I

1067
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,859
think a kind of ethnographic void in a

1068
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,119
lot of literature and post-modern

1069
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,980
urbanism what do I mean by this it

1070
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,660
really relies on a kind of deep text

1071
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,240
reading of the city this is the most

1072
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,880
let's see extreme example

1073
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,160
this is how we see the city I mean if

1074
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,720
there is anything more top-down than

1075
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,280
this I mean it's hard to imagine right

1076
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,780
it really is like okay let's hear this

1077
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,240
is how we see the city but it has no way

1078
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,480
at no stage do you see any engagement

1079
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,520
well with what people on the ground

1080
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,320
actually think about the city they live

1081
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,480
in or work in yeah so it's a very sort

1082
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,720
of top-down Matrix oriented reading of

1083
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,480
the city so which is labeled as an

1084
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,280
ethnographic void which I think is the

1085
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,099
most forceful to your team yeah it has a

1086
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:21,780
marginalized agency and interpretation

1087
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,839
of Ordinary People yeah and there's no

1088
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,000
so there's also no post-modernism From

1089
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,920
Below you could you could imagine a kind

1090
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,320
of let's say fragmented urbanism and

1091
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,880
then brick collage a combination of

1092
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,119
elements by people making making do

1093
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,040
making a living in a city and combining

1094
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,720
different elements but none of that is

1095
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,420
part of this discussion okay so it's a

1096
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,760
Much More Much Too dubbed down too too

1097
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,800
detached reading

1098
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,440
last critique and they said it relates a

1099
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,420
bit to this idea that La pre-figures

1100
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,119
wider Urban developments they're saying

1101
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,700
well la is actually not that radically

1102
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,480
different on two levels uh first within

1103
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,540
La existing Urban theories before the LA

1104
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,240
School of urbanism are still relevant to

1105
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,740
explain what happens in la la is not a

1106
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,400
complete free let's say board with

1107
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,020
quasi-random uh let's say activities

1108
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,700
taking place no you can use all the

1109
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,859
theories around let's say agglomeration

1110
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:22,320
for example in order to understand LA or

1111
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,060
in this wider region so that's one thing

1112
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,579
the other side is that the empirical

1113
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:29,820
phenomena we see in LA are also visible

1114
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,820
elsewhere and not just as a prefiguring

1115
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,380
not something that comes after the other

1116
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,500
school urbanists talked about La no but

1117
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,460
actually something that was already

1118
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,320
before maybe some cities were even

1119
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,480
earlier and the other thing is also to

1120
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,300
some extent where especially research is

1121
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,940
working in the global Styles uh really

1122
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,160
connected to right say okay there's much

1123
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,800
happening elsewhere which is perhaps

1124
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,960
more interesting also and certainly

1125
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,940
shows let's say that La is not that

1126
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,260
special after all

1127
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,980
okay

1128
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,119
wow went fast yeah

1129
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,800
get off the screen

1130
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,920
questions

1131
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:48,119
well I mean I would

1132
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,579
I would situate that a bit I would say

1133
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,680
certain strands within geography this

1134
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,319
was at least what what you're saying but

1135
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:56,940
if you look at much of this literature

1136
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,339
especially worked by people like Alexis

1137
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,140
and Christopherson they're all working

1138
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,200
in a kind of realist vein right in the

1139
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,599
sense of it's pretty straightforward

1140
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,400
Empirical research right there's a world

1141
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,319
out there we're going to study it some

1142
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,359
of the examples you mentioned might have

1143
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,099
happened but I would say that was more

1144
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,960
or less a visible or more Central to the

1145
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,119
debate in literary studies it may be

1146
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,160
cultural studies to some extent and less

1147
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,540
so in geography

1148
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,599
so um I don't think it was necessarily A

1149
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,160
in when it came to the LA School of

1150
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,740
urban is the necessary much reflection

1151
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,839
actually on the epistemological the

1152
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:32,940
methodological Dimension and it was more

1153
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,220
an observation of new empirical facts on

1154
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,500
the ground which necessitated new

1155
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,839
theories according to them so I think

1156
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,060
it's more on that level but obviously I

1157
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,619
mean as I said at the very end there is

1158
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,020
no such thing as one cultural turn and

1159
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,520
also no such thing as one force

1160
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,160
modernism so I think that's uh and if

1161
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,500
you look at the way a term such as the

1162
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,920
postmodern has been um let's say discuss

1163
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,540
within different disciplines you see

1164
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,420
quite radical differences between what

1165
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,160
is actually understood by the postmodern

1166
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,260
in the first place and there are

1167
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,760
interesting books written on this also

1168
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,280
but yeah that yeah

1169
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,740
okay other questions on these first

1170
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,440
three was it two more substantial parts

1171
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,339
nope

1172
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,460
um how are we doing time wise yeah let's

1173
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,599
give it a few more minutes and then

1174
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:25,859
we'll see

1175
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:28,440
um am I talking too fast or is it

1176
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,560
okay-ish I think the fact that I have to

1177
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,599
speak very loud automatically slows me

1178
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,579
down right so that helps in a way so I

1179
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:37,560
might just start screaming in my

1180
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,079
lectures and then I'll I'll slow down my

1181
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,240
Tempo yeah

1182
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,420
foreign

1183
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,660
so we've got cultural term we've got

1184
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,859
postmodern let's say jamesonian

1185
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:58,140
approaches a sort of Vision on the

1186
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,579
postmodern

1187
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:02,339
this indirectly or directly influence a

1188
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,619
lot of La school urbanism work yeah I

1189
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,119
think it was not just Jameson but there

1190
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,619
are many many that see similarities

1191
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:10,079
there and there's a related strand which

1192
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,119
now I want to discuss with you which I

1193
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:13,980
would call as the urban Landscapes and

1194
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,680
symbolic economy mostly because this is

1195
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,359
the terminology that was

1196
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,040
that I mean the different strands of

1197
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,480
research but there's a lot of research

1198
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,240
around these this kind of teams which

1199
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,640
supposedly refer to actual facts on the

1200
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,380
ground so don't see it as something

1201
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,599
completely different from let's say the

1202
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,000
other school of urban is more let's say

1203
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,640
developing in parallel perhaps also a

1204
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,020
different inspiration it's coming a bit

1205
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,520
more I would argue from black City

1206
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,020
Cultural studies tradition which also

1207
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,660
emerged in the 1980s yeah but obviously

1208
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,420
their interactions also so just uh to

1209
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,000
know as a clear cut categories here

1210
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,339
if you look at what I now describe as

1211
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:51,960
let's say one body of literature because

1212
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,579
for me it makes sense to describe this

1213
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,260
as a relatively coherent body of

1214
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,359
literature there are a number of key

1215
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,300
guiding assumptions arguments shaping

1216
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,819
this kind of literature one very similar

1217
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,240
to Jameson flexible accumulation

1218
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,560
post-forwardism and post-modernism are

1219
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,599
two sides of the same coin so this is

1220
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,339
your Marx's argument right so there's a

1221
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:13,980
political economy and the culture as you

1222
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,740
can see that let's see the other side of

1223
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,420
this political economy but it's it's

1224
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,540
it's it's impossible to extract it just

1225
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,000
belongs very closely together

1226
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,099
and Innovation perhaps that this

1227
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:28,740
literature introduced is it's according

1228
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,180
to the much of this literature says well

1229
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,599
we see the rise of postmodernism also

1230
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,400
hanging together with the rise of a new

1231
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,920
middle class yeah and this very much

1232
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,260
hangs together again with just a rise of

1233
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,780
post-fortism post-industrialism because

1234
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,760
it Latin new you could say work

1235
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,099
opportunities new fields of work new

1236
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:49,500
labor markets which demand that you

1237
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,819
could say uh a uh a a a type of worker a

1238
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:55,859
type of population that was overall

1239
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,599
Highly Educated that was knowledge

1240
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,400
oriented yeah so this is the kind of

1241
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,440
debate around higher education

1242
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,900
knowledge-based capitalism and this was

1243
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,640
very much seen as it's higher educated

1244
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,560
and this is what they should understood

1245
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,480
to be the rise of a new middle class

1246
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,700
yeah it's not your classic middle class

1247
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,460
which perhaps massive more fixed but and

1248
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,380
this is the introduction that was done

1249
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,119
here say okay this rise of the numeral

1250
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:19,140
class

1251
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,800
is accompanied by a device or an

1252
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,540
interest and new you could say aesthetic

1253
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,240
sensibility sensitivities interests

1254
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,700
preferences yeah this idea that there's

1255
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,460
a new kind of Aesthetics emerging with

1256
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,980
this new group of people yeah which they

1257
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,839
labeled and commodity Aesthetics in a

1258
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,060
way that because was highly driven or

1259
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,800
widely related to let's say lifestyle

1260
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,839
preferences yeah

1261
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:45,300
I'm interested come up with a good

1262
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,940
example I'm interested I work for let's

1263
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,319
say a

1264
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:51,119
not I can't come up with a good example

1265
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,560
I try to come up with a better example

1266
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,579
here

1267
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:55,680
I'll give examples in a minute yes it

1268
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,300
doesn't really matter

1269
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,740
um

1270
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,359
[Music]

1271
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:01,980
no because the kinds of examples I was

1272
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,020
thinking about are mostly around let's

1273
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,640
say Urban Street culture for example

1274
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,380
which is very much related to particular

1275
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,500
let's say the lifestyles that really

1276
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,480
lead to let's say how you identify with

1277
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,680
particular Lifestyles and these

1278
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,300
lifestyles are closely connected to the

1279
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,880
buying and showing of particular

1280
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,780
Commodities yeah shoes clothes

1281
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,740
artworks that you affiliate that you

1282
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,140
associate with if you're a bit higher up

1283
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,339
Etc

1284
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,319
so let's say the second part third one

1285
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,780
is that culture was key or is key to

1286
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,119
Urban Redevelopment this has remained I

1287
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,040
think very influential I'm doing work on

1288
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,839
this still but there's also his work

1289
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:39,240
that was already let's say put forward

1290
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,940
and started being done in the late 1980s

1291
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,980
work being done on real estate on

1292
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,500
artists on on representations of urban

1293
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,599
space yeah if you think now of work

1294
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:51,780
being done on the impact of of

1295
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,660
gentrification yeah on on City spaces

1296
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,880
how artists play a role in both let's

1297
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,339
say boosting gentrification but also

1298
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:01,319
being kicked out of gentrifying areas

1299
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:03,359
That's a classic argument which Harris

1300
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,760
you can already made in the early you

1301
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,280
know in the mid 1980s so not much has

1302
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,140
changed you could say in that in that

1303
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,280
respect

1304
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,140
and the fourth role I think this is

1305
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,520
something that was relatively new

1306
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,079
perhaps also picked up more on the

1307
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,119
European side of the discussion and

1308
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,640
which was not really at all really

1309
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,980
picked up by the by the alley School of

1310
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,200
urbanism is an important role of the

1311
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,839
state yeah staying investing in cultural

1312
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,880
landmarks but also really developing all

1313
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,040
kinds of cultural economic policies yeah

1314
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,500
so this is what more or less it would

1315
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,880
have to give let's say a nutshell

1316
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,640
definition or a listing of key elements

1317
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,520
what the symbolic economy literature is

1318
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,240
more or less about

1319
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,599
few examples

1320
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,640
one interesting article that Paul Knox

1321
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,579
the rest of those Urban landscape early

1322
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:56,280
1990s where we argued very much along

1323
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,740
jamesonian lines there's widespread

1324
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,960
agreements that the emergence of

1325
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,720
post-modern architecture culture and

1326
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,720
philosophy in Western Society has

1327
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,000
proceeded in tandling with the emergence

1328
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,520
of globalized more flexible forms of

1329
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,619
capitalist Enterprise

1330
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,559
or second part of that quote

1331
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:18,000
post-modernism as the cultural closing

1332
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,700
of advanced capitalism you know so this

1333
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,160
is basically Jameson all over again this

1334
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,859
idea two sides of the same goal I

1335
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:27,960
register a question here because I mean

1336
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,819
I would question if there was really

1337
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,220
that kind of widespread agreement yes

1338
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,140
there was widespread agreement on this

1339
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,559
claim within Marx's political economy

1340
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:40,920
and yes marxian political economy became

1341
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,599
let's say especially within geography

1342
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,180
that's a pretty not dominant But Central

1343
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,579
to the debate I would say in the 1980s

1344
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,740
and 1990s or especially in the early

1345
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,859
1990s and this is part of that kind of

1346
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,619
explanatory logic yeah I personally I

1347
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:58,079
mean I mean see much to agree with and

1348
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,700
these kinds of claims but I don't think

1349
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,400
actually that that let's say cultural

1350
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,920
expressions are always that easily the

1351
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,260
other side of the same coin of the of

1352
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,240
let's say the capitalist political

1353
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,920
economy yeah so if there's more

1354
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,140
complexity there that is easily let's

1355
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,420
say simplified

1356
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,240
um so this is important to keep in mind

1357
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,980
unless of course you fully agree with

1358
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,400
this argument which is which is possible

1359
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,579
foreign

1360
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,960
so the point about the rise of a new

1361
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,880
Miller Glass again in the same article

1362
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,160
knocks offers a quite a useful summary I

1363
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,059
find

1364
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,040
yeah it makes a couple of claims which

1365
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,140
is not specific to Knox but I think

1366
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,180
specific or or representative let's say

1367
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,680
this wider literature

1368
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,420
first he says well and this is the shift

1369
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,059
to post industrialism the emergence of

1370
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:56,339
new class fractions under Advanced

1371
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,160
capitalism yeah so we see dominant

1372
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,900
classes but actually they change over

1373
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,940
time but so the structurally speaking

1374
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,980
let's say this hierarchy remains but

1375
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,440
different class fractions might emerge

1376
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,240
to become dominant this is what not

1377
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,339
under Advanced capitalism you see the

1378
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:13,140
emergence of new class fractions or the

1379
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,240
new middle class under Advanced

1380
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,260
capitalism

1381
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,660
that's the economic arguments the

1382
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,240
cultural argument would be this was also

1383
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,579
a generational reaction against

1384
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,440
modernist Aesthetics

1385
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,900
let's see the children growing up in the

1386
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,059
1960s rebelled against their modernist

1387
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,040
parents and thus started proporting

1388
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,599
different ways of Behaving different

1389
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,180
ways of cultural preferences yeah

1390
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,980
it's not wrong it's highly simplified

1391
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,020
but it's not it's not wrong of course so

1392
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,240
that's you could say the socio-cultural

1393
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,619
uh

1394
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:46,140
related to this this related to that

1395
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,940
let's say this move away this critique

1396
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,300
of of modernism you really referred more

1397
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,280
to the kind of lifestyle orientation but

1398
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,920
you can look at positively art becomes

1399
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,599
part of everyday life yeah this is

1400
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,040
something that does not use something

1401
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,960
that is separate from us no it becomes

1402
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,180
even more radical but you can also look

1403
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,339
at it more critically or it just becomes

1404
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:07,140
another commodity it's just a question

1405
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,940
of lifestyle of showing your identity

1406
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,920
showing off your identity yeah so

1407
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,319
there's a lifestyle orientation

1408
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,599
self-realization expression and I need

1409
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,579
free responsibility cultural politics

1410
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,559
true sort of culture you position

1411
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:24,079
yourself as a citizen in many ways

1412
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:26,220
for Local Economic explanation as

1413
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,720
already into that is this kind of

1414
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,940
commodity Aesthetics a kind of Niche

1415
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,280
oriented consumption with emphasis on

1416
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,020
tastes and Aesthetics and hence an

1417
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,940
increased role for design also someone

1418
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,640
like Paul Knox and later work he

1419
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,740
specifically focus on Urban Design or

1420
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:44,579
design the design sector as a central

1421
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:47,819
sector in advanced capitalism yeah and

1422
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:49,260
we can also we can all understand how

1423
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,880
this works I mean I think we're all

1424
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,420
parts in a way of this group right so I

1425
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,400
wear disclosing but not that close even

1426
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,960
though it's exactly the same as just a

1427
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,300
slightly different color right I wear

1428
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,339
these shoes but not these shoes or I

1429
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:05,400
want wooden floors or not these kinds of

1430
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,500
floors in my house depending on which

1431
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,720
phased in your life your life you are

1432
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,359
right it's pretty Niche but still we

1433
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:13,980
have very strong opinions about this

1434
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,480
yeah don't start talking to me about

1435
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,220
music I have very strong opinions about

1436
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,559
music but if I look at it for more

1437
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:21,900
distance uh obviously I have to admit

1438
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,059
that it's pretty Niche yeah so now I

1439
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,140
sort of

1440
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,040
um

1441
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,559
let's see I uh let's say establish

1442
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,960
distinctions between what is good bad or

1443
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,420
better or or not as good yeah it's

1444
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,520
pretty specific yeah so I think this is

1445
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,260
important this is really about this

1446
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,059
Niche oriented consumption that has

1447
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:42,059
increased I think rapidly over the last

1448
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:43,859
30 years I think this is not something

1449
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:47,220
that we saw to such an extent

1450
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,440
if you would go to the 1980s for example

1451
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,579
in the early 1980s

1452
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,359
cultured Urban Redevelopment so another

1453
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,980
strand I would say that is really part

1454
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,260
of this kind of debate

1455
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,940
um even earlier indeed I forgot that

1456
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,020
it's this early

1457
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,640
one of the earliest probably the first

1458
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,260
book actually by Sharon zukin it's

1459
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,700
called love living

1460
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,440
I guess most of you would also know

1461
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,940
Sharon zukin who has done a lot of work

1462
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,460
in culture in the city

1463
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,319
and law of living was already published

1464
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,079
in 1982. I think she was early for her

1465
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,660
time so it's not uh you could say not

1466
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,160
that typical but it was really a

1467
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,319
foundational book I think and it really

1468
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:27,660
shapes still many of the debates that

1469
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,280
we're having today around the role of

1470
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,079
artists in particular in urban settings

1471
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:32,280
yeah

1472
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,440
so around love living which was New York

1473
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,300
oriented and there were lofts in New

1474
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,619
York but there are lofts in New York

1475
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:39,780
which of course does not apply to every

1476
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,000
city but structurally speaking you can

1477
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,160
see similar processes at least in larger

1478
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,140
cities I would say

1479
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,420
what did she argue okay we have let's

1480
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,760
say abandoned moths anti-locks and we

1481
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,040
see a reoccupancy of abandoned

1482
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,319
structures by artists so early 1980s

1483
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:57,420
we're talking about here also New York

1484
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,339
at the height you could say of its

1485
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:01,800
crisis and let's say at the deep end of

1486
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,960
this development yeah but there's the

1487
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,880
first thing a reoccupancy of abandoned

1488
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,220
structures by ours this is Then followed

1489
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,680
by a new middle class yeah so the

1490
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,300
artists move in first it's still

1491
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,740
roughing Rowdy but then the new Miller

1492
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,540
class it moves in and it gets a bit more

1493
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,520
a bit more let's see clean a bit more

1494
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,220
fancy which she calls a reconquest of

1495
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,420
the inner city

1496
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:24,180
leading to a kind of Loft lifestyle they

1497
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,339
have people living in

1498
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:28,800
let's see dwellings that do not

1499
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,660
represent your classical at certainly at

1500
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,880
that point in time Suburban let's say

1501
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,099
one Family household so you have to come

1502
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:37,920
up with a new architectural style a new

1503
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,780
way of imagining how to live in these

1504
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,339
laws yeah

1505
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:43,500
his size and also become an increasing

1506
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,359
terrain of conflict between competing

1507
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,300
users both between Alton advances if the

1508
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,880
inhabitants if they were still there

1509
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,559
artists and a new middle class yeah

1510
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,359
where artists use Lofts also as a

1511
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:56,520
production infrastructure to produce art

1512
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,980
the new middle class by and large used

1513
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,500
these laws as residential infrastructure

1514
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,800
yeah and you work somewhere else yeah

1515
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,260
and then culture is also in a very early

1516
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,420
on especially even from the early 1980s

1517
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,420
owners in New York was used to develop

1518
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,700
and profit from him from an emergent

1519
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,680
real estate market so real estate

1520
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,619
intermediaries very early on realize

1521
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:22,260
that ah these artists moving in suddenly

1522
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,300
this area becomes interesting becomes

1523
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,000
visible at the very least and thus we

1524
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,800
can actually use this we can exploit

1525
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,420
this this is something we can build on

1526
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,760
yeah we can start identifying this we

1527
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,760
can start selling this for a profit yeah

1528
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,099
now this was early 1980s I mean if and

1529
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,319
if I tell you this story it's pretty

1530
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,720
clear I would think being you all being

1531
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,720
Urban Scholars that this Rings this

1532
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,579
resonates let's put it at those terms

1533
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:49,799
resonates with discussions you see on an

1534
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:51,180
everyday level and most of the cities

1535
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,400
that you're familiar with yeah this idea

1536
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,680
that ah that us identifying areas this

1537
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,960
is like a Proto a proto-definition of

1538
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,099
gentrification or cultural

1539
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:02,160
gentrification yeah so when I think if I

1540
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,440
think of an area such as I know in

1541
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,780
Russell such as sanjul to some extent

1542
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,380
this logic is followed yeah and I mean

1543
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,359
I'm not familiar with too many cities

1544
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:14,400
but I see similar things happening in

1545
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,200
Berlin or so and you still see it

1546
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,059
happening and saw it happening and then

1547
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:21,599
many other cities where this is the case

1548
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,299
for this has been a major strand of

1549
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:25,920
research for quite a long time already

1550
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,619
and it has been refined Etc but it still

1551
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:32,299
shapes shapes the discussion

1552
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:43,079
so ultimately of course there's also and

1553
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,640
again this has also received research

1554
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,260
attention but also means that artists

1555
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,720
have become both drivers and victims of

1556
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,119
Urban Development yeah it is a similar

1557
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,180
article from that time ourselves

1558
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,540
which shows our artists were well really

1559
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,480
the earlier let's say the the movers to

1560
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,280
move into a certain area and to start

1561
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,900
developing the area true Building

1562
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,339
Development to a lot of development or

1563
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,140
other types of uh Building Development

1564
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,740
but then when the the the area the

1565
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,960
neighborhood had reached a certain stage

1566
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,700
of development and real estate prices

1567
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,980
odds then again we're in a sense moved

1568
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,000
out because they couldn't no longer

1569
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,700
afford uh to live there except those

1570
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,559
perhaps that were smart enough to buy at

1571
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,780
an early stage but this was rarely uh

1572
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,280
the case but then they had so they were

1573
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,559
both drivers and victims of urban change

1574
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,859
and this again hasn't changed that much

1575
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:33,720
over the last 30 years except that

1576
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,240
perhaps this phenomenon has globalized

1577
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,700
and it has become a much more strategic

1578
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,660
uh government uh well much more let's

1579
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:45,059
say forceful government strategy so this

1580
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,920
is in a way mainstream Urban Development

1581
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,420
by now

1582
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,940
okay looking at the time let's take a

1583
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,859
quick break uh and then I'll continue

1584
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:55,619
with the second part or let's see the

1585
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:59,000
the last third of the lecture

1586
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,960

01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,480
all right let's continue

1625
01:11:39,739 --> 01:11:43,820
that's my first announcements

1626
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,400
foreign

1627
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:20,159
everything

1628
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,540
yeah okay let's go

1629
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,460
um so we're still in the symbolic

1630
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,260
economy part

1631
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,900
um and I'm discussing different strands

1632
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,699
or what I mean this is lesson identified

1633
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:47,280
by me so what I consider to be a

1634
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,840
relatively clear and body of leadership

1635
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,340
within this body of literature there are

1636
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:52,500
a number of different strands of let's

1637
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,320
say research attention yeah so before

1638
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,960
and I just finished the part on let's

1639
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,179
say cultural Redevelopment

1640
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:02,580
now in last part within that section I

1641
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,260
would argue really focuses on

1642
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,600
representation of urban space now please

1643
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,400
understand every strength that I discuss

1644
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,500
I can only do so much in a two-hour

1645
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,500
lecture minus the breaks But please

1646
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,840
understand every strand as potential

1647
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,940
let's say lives of Investigation for

1648
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,860
yourself for a paper for your

1649
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:22,679
Massachusetts whatever right just I'm

1650
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:24,420
trying to let's say hopefully give some

1651
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:26,460
inspiration as to what possible teams

1652
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,560
possible topics are that you might want

1653
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,080
to engage with in more detail so this

1654
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,420
isn't also for me a bit I want to see us

1655
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:36,480
as my role in in especially for those

1656
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,580
here in their first semester of their

1657
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,699
first year Masters what I see as my role

1658
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:44,219
just giving a few let's say 400 few

1659
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,320
ideas about what could potentially be

1660
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,760
interesting to do more research about

1661
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,400
yeah so one element here is

1662
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,679
representation of urban space this is

1663
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:55,140
probably a relatively straightforward

1664
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,179
exercise where a lot of attention

1665
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:59,699
recently and especially also outside of

1666
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:02,159
urban studies in marketing it's

1667
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,500
cruciatingly boring but still that's not

1668
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,780
a discussion but we should investigated

1669
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,640
the role of media and marketing in

1670
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,820
putting cities on the map yeah yeah I

1671
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,800
mean I should say Nuance there's a lot

1672
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,300
of boring research being done in this

1673
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,440
field there's also some interesting

1674
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,659
research being done in this field but

1675
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:21,360
some of this very very instrumental yeah

1676
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,580
so there's this research that focuses on

1677
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,340
Urban images what kind of images do we

1678
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,840
have in mind when we think about cities

1679
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,460
how we can really sort of change these

1680
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:32,699
images also contested images yeah and we

1681
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:34,739
all will have let's say City images in

1682
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:36,239
our mind when you're not going to do the

1683
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,280
quiz now whatever would ask you to sort

1684
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,260
of I wouldn't mention the city I would

1685
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:43,199
ask you to to to mention the image the

1686
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,880
first image that pops up in your ads

1687
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,860
then it's quite clear there will be a

1688
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,600
large element of consensus I think

1689
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,179
within the audience yeah Paris Eiffel

1690
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:52,679
Tower I mean something like that right

1691
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:55,320
so the couple of uh cliches

1692
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,300
this has become increasingly important

1693
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,239
and debates also around Urban tourism

1694
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,219
especially European cities have always

1695
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:05,340
been key sites for tourism yeah so

1696
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,780
there's The Grand Tour there's sort of

1697
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:08,840
let's say the upper middle classes

1698
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,880
Aristocrats between let's say European

1699
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,040
Elites who have let's say traveled to

1700
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,679
and around Europe two different European

1701
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,780
cities but this has become let's say

1702
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,659
massified over the last 60 70 years

1703
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:24,420
early after World War II yeah and it

1704
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,219
just really that's it to like to its own

1705
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:27,800
development around Urban tourism

1706
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,880
explicitly of course let's see the whole

1707
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,460
discussion about America yeah Airbnb

1708
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:36,780
would also fit in here yeah this has

1709
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:38,340
increased they also been picked up where

1710
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,280
you could say it was to some extent

1711
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,380
firm driven that's the entrepreneur

1712
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,600
driven this has increasingly been picked

1713
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,659
up by most local and National States as

1714
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:50,820
important development strategies for the

1715
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:51,480
local

1716
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,800
government

1717
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,800
and the focus on tourism as an important

1718
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,500
driver for your economy it's a highly

1719
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,120
volatile economy of course and this is

1720
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,000
something we now see with covert well in

1721
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,860
a very clear sense suddenly everything

1722
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,620
falls flat and therefore that's for

1723
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,360
locally conscious rely heavily on

1724
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,580
tourism that's obviously is is quite a

1725
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,020
disaster

1726
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,340
um if we're economically speaking of

1727
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,659
course socially speaking that's another

1728
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:18,120
discussion that is a nice book also

1729
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,500
that's why I just mentioned it here I'm

1730
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,179
not going to discuss it

1731
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:24,300
but in any detail by mayor Greenback

1732
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,940
in a new upside branding New York how a

1733
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,440
Sydney in crisis was sold to the world

1734
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,480
which traces a bit let's say The

1735
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,159
Branding of New York from the 1980s

1736
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,739
onwards our city at let's say at the

1737
01:16:34,739 --> 01:16:37,500
bottom ends uh being confronted without

1738
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,320
migration actually tried to reinvent

1739
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,960
itself through its images in order to

1740
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,060
become let's say more attractive again

1741
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,699
open question of course if The Branding

1742
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:49,380
has played the most important role in

1743
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,420
the city becoming more attractive but

1744
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:54,840
certainly it has played a role in this

1745
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,300
okay

1746
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,000
last part in the role of the states uh

1747
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,800
very briefly

1748
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,719
um again this is debate that has been

1749
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:05,760
picked up both in urban studies as well

1750
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,560
as outside of urban studies from a

1751
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,880
cultural perspective especially in

1752
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,440
literature specifically on cultural

1753
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,900
policies which is a dedicated field of

1754
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,600
research on its own

1755
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,040
um

1756
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,960
which I would say you see a couple of

1757
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,820
things we see strategies aimed at really

1758
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,560
developing cultural Industries I have

1759
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,360
myself done research on on this whole

1760
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,520
debate around cultural Industries which

1761
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,260
is very much about Local Economic

1762
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,360
Development this idea that you actually

1763
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,120
attract artists cultural workers to your

1764
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,360
city in in order to sort of develop your

1765
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,340
local economies much research attention

1766
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,560
has gone into this since the 1990s but

1767
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,440
especially 2000s yeah there's also

1768
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,140
research around large-scale events World

1769
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:48,780
fairs art exhibitions again this has a

1770
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,239
much much longer history it transcends

1771
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:52,739
also Urban studies as a discipline

1772
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:54,840
because if you look at let's say a

1773
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,840
discipline such as art history that has

1774
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,920
done excellent work on let's say

1775
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,780
Arts exhibitions and World fairs from

1776
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,940
the mid-19th century onwards yeah so

1777
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,640
yeah we're always let's say events to

1778
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,560
attract a global or this European

1779
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,219
audience to your city but again this has

1780
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:16,980
become increasingly kind of economic

1781
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,960
strategy so you want to attract the

1782
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,760
Olympic Games you want to attract a

1783
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,699
biannual or you want to have a

1784
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,800
Etc yeah there's also been increasing

1785
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,960
critiqued because often there's a lot of

1786
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,360
investment going into this but what

1787
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,640
actually is that's it it delivers then

1788
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,219
it turns out to be quite Limited

1789
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:36,719
and more broadly I think there's

1790
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,640
literature again from the 1980s all the

1791
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,040
word squash related to work by zukin on

1792
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,960
the Arts and the urban growth machine as

1793
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,719
it was called in the 1980s certainly

1794
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,060
which really focuses on let's say Arts

1795
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,580
networks Elite networks and arts

1796
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:52,739
institute Arts institutions as local

1797
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:55,320
attractors for invert investment and

1798
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,600
Urban Development yeah so there's a

1799
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,940
classic example if you look at

1800
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:03,060
sorry the museum built in the gubernet

1801
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,159
museum in Bilbao that's an always

1802
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:08,340
mentioned case when it comes to uh you

1803
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,860
place a museum in a relatively run down

1804
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,840
City I'm simplifying here and this

1805
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,880
should really boost the local economy

1806
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,920
and to some extent it did again with

1807
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,140
many issues attached to it but it's not

1808
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,320
completely false yeah so there this is

1809
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,520
work that has received a lot of

1810
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,880
attention also

1811
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,420
here one more recent example uh not sure

1812
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:33,360
if the city needed you could say this uh

1813
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,100
it was certainly not a round run-down

1814
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,840
City in a sense does anyone know this

1815
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,199
example

1816
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,340
so it's the M plus Museum in Hong Kong

1817
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,960
actually which actually was just open I

1818
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,179
think two one or two weeks ago two weeks

1819
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:50,820
ago designed by star Architects Herzog

1820
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:55,140
in the Miron uh and a well a uh a

1821
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,960
typical UKC example of a city that is

1822
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,159
both

1823
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:01,080
aimed at attracting and perhaps

1824
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,460
improving you would say the cultural

1825
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,860
image of Hong Kong but attracting uh

1826
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,380
let's say tourism to the city but also

1827
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:09,120
as a kind of

1828
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,540
uh let's see

1829
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,920
advertisement for the city and to some

1830
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,840
extent in a very little sense because

1831
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,300
the the main building side you say is

1832
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,060
one big LCD screen at the same time next

1833
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,500
to being a museum so you could actually

1834
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,140
sort of literally see how this is a kind

1835
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,360
of commodity aesthetic right so very

1836
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:31,080
very literal manner

1837
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,880
but also for example big commercial

1838
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,100
artifacts such as the Art Basel who

1839
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,080
develop let's say

1840
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,239
um well which is now staging I'm not

1841
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:40,500
quite sure what the current state is

1842
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,420
because also covertly messed up a lot

1843
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,060
but what it was is a stage annual art

1844
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,239
fairs in Basel in Miami and in Hong Kong

1845
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,400
um not only do these events attract

1846
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,980
wealthy Visitors by and large yeah they

1847
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,540
also spend there in these cities so

1848
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:55,739
again it becomes a kind of local

1849
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:58,860
development machine yeah more recently

1850
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:01,320
Art Basel also started a so-called Art

1851
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,719
Basel cities initiative where I try to

1852
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:07,140
have events in different cities which in

1853
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,000
this case Buenos Aires is one example

1854
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,640
which supposedly should benefit the Art

1855
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,040
Basel because it can globalize more but

1856
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,659
also other cities across the world who

1857
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:17,699
do not have the annual art fairs can

1858
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:19,560
supposedly benefit from let's see the

1859
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,360
name and reputation of the art barsing

1860
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,420
and we see these kinds of initiatives

1861
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,920
emerging quite forcefully over the last

1862
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,460
especially over the last 10-15 years

1863
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:32,179
okay

1864
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,820
last section for today and I'm actually

1865
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,540
doing quite well on time so um I also

1866
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,300
won't discuss this uh unless not every

1867
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,739
every bullet point on the slide

1868
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,659
but just as a kind of wrapping wrapping

1869
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:49,860
up

1870
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,500
to reposition let's say my my debate

1871
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,360
which was let's say mostly oriented

1872
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,480
within urban geography but to reposition

1873
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,460
it again within a broader debate on the

1874
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:01,080
spatial term yeah so much of what I

1875
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,699
discussed was launching a geographical

1876
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:06,239
concern or geographical concerns but the

1877
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:08,699
spatial turn more broadly frames that

1878
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:11,580
kind of debate foreign

1879
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:14,640
so just to wrap up in the late 20th

1880
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,440
century urban geography was heavily

1881
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,060
influenced by the cultural term this I

1882
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,219
discussed yeah so I related the based on

1883
01:22:20,219 --> 01:22:22,260
post-modernism and globalization yeah

1884
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:24,600
this has had to in effect let's say the

1885
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,760
epistemological methodological effects

1886
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,679
was that there was an increased interest

1887
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:32,360
in ethnography everyday life imaginaries

1888
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,520
representations or in short culture yeah

1889
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,900
so this is really what I think has

1890
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,020
shaped much of urban geography over the

1891
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,420
last uh well 30 years

1892
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,460
across the social science and this is

1893
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,280
how I opened my lecture of today this uh

1894
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,199
cultural turn intertwined with an

1895
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,420
increased interest in spatial

1896
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:53,280
configurations so let's say urban

1897
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,440
geography is already into that became

1898
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,000
more interested in cultural questions

1899
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,699
the cultural disciplines which I would

1900
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:01,199
say is cultural studies and and

1901
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:02,719
anthropology

1902
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:04,860
became more interested in spatial

1903
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,239
questions yeah

1904
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:08,219
so there were a number of reasons for

1905
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:11,040
this one is and I addressed this in some

1906
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,120
other lectures

1907
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,640
one is a kind of really post 1989

1908
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,800
obsession with globalization

1909
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,219
on one level one superficial level

1910
01:23:19,219 --> 01:23:22,800
globalization is or is is the end of

1911
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,540
spatial questions because everything is

1912
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:27,060
global yeah but it actually intensified

1913
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,679
this concern with spatial questions

1914
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:30,620
because it soon became clear of course

1915
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:34,199
that it was a process that actually had

1916
01:23:34,199 --> 01:23:36,000
spatial effects the other spatial

1917
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,159
process there was a stretching of social

1918
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,800
relations taking place which could be

1919
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,960
and and needed to be understood in a

1920
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,140
spatial manner yeah connecting a to B uh

1921
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,060
as a spatial effect and it leads to

1922
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,080
different let's say spatial

1923
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,600
configuration

1924
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,380
uh social sciences Humanities sorry yeah

1925
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:57,360
in order to be able to fit everything on

1926
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,400
an already too crowded slide I had to

1927
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,260
sort of

1928
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,940
across the social sciences and

1929
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:05,219
Humanities yeah so the creating interest

1930
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:07,020
in spatial crash and spatial questions

1931
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:08,280
and this of course is where the

1932
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,500
geography starts becoming let's say an

1933
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,420
inspirational discipline for other

1934
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,159
disciplines this is exactly what happens

1935
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,060
in the 1990s especially

1936
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,140
hence an increased interaction between

1937
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:20,640
our job to Urban methropology and

1938
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,260
cultural studies which are already

1939
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:25,280
hinted at

1940
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,420
um

1941
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,980
I'm only going to go quickly through

1942
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,960
this but uh the the slides are slightly

1943
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,880
more detailed

1944
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:33,600
um

1945
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,420
because I added these slides because not

1946
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:38,460
let's say

1947
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,920
the elements I discussed in the previous

1948
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,600
slides the previous one hour and 20

1949
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,400
minutes or so

1950
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,400
um cover I would say most of what is

1951
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,040
relevant concern the culture in urban

1952
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,860
geography over the last 30 40 years

1953
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,360
which is already quite a challenge to

1954
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,640
fit that into a two-hour lecture but it

1955
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,620
really misses also some elements so I

1956
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,540
mean I propose let's say quietly let's

1957
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:02,940
say in a way a linear trajectory of how

1958
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:04,380
previous discussions influence current

1959
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:05,940
discussions and that had an effect on

1960
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,980
this but in parallel of course there

1961
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,480
were also discussions and I just want to

1962
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,880
briefly hint at it because there's again

1963
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,440
these are all of us that have become

1964
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,060
more or less important but they can't

1965
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:17,400
really necessarily Trace back to some of

1966
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,500
the elements to let's say Friday Jameson

1967
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:20,580
for example

1968
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,500
so there are two

1969
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,500
core teams perhaps that have also really

1970
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,699
shaped

1971
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:27,540
um

1972
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,520
interdisciplinary Urban studies over the

1973
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,560
last couple of years and that in a way

1974
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,320
have emerged more more forcefully from

1975
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,239
disciplines outside of geography but

1976
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,580
it's definitely let's say informing

1977
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:41,580
Urban studies at large which for me is a

1978
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,580
very interdisciplinary discipline uh

1979
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:47,280
up to this day two elements one

1980
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,699
informality second everyday life

1981
01:25:49,699 --> 01:25:52,199
informality for those that have studied

1982
01:25:52,199 --> 01:25:54,300
ethnography and topology they will they

1983
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,400
will become have been well will be quite

1984
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,260
familiar with this term

1985
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:58,920
um

1986
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,540
is historically and I'll give some

1987
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:02,820
examples there a religion has looked

1988
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,860
specifically on coming from also

1989
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,620
Economic Development perspectives or

1990
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,400
developmentalists perspectives to some

1991
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,679
extent focusing on labor markets

1992
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:13,199
precarious work migration legality

1993
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,060
political governance and conversations

1994
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:17,580
I'll unpacked this in a minute

1995
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:20,280
everyday life partially overlapping but

1996
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,560
partially coming from uh whereas this

1997
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,780
tends to become simplifying you from

1998
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:27,120
from anthropology everyday life tends to

1999
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:27,960
come

2000
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:30,239
but I would say is cultural studies as a

2001
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:31,820
discipline that emerged in the 1980s

2002
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:34,860
focusing very much on agency community

2003
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:37,560
community building resistance off on

2004
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,659
local level of Lifestyle driven

2005
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:42,480
consumption identity media and

2006
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,179
representation yeah so and precisely

2007
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:46,620
these terms those that read the

2008
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,719
newspaper provides there's this

2009
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,880
obsession with some of these terms as

2010
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,920
that they want to critique and that

2011
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,480
emerge I think most falsely from

2012
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,100
cultural studies obviously the the

2013
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,840
critics have never read cultural studies

2014
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,440
but that's another discussion

2015
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:04,560
uh let me see

2016
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,659
now in formality I mentioning this here

2017
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:08,219
because this has become a special last

2018
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:10,020
10 years Urban studies I mean there's so

2019
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,820
much research taking place now on on

2020
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:14,820
informality and the urban uh but it's

2021
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,440
important to keep in mind that this was

2022
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,880
already a classic team within Urban

2023
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,040
anthropology and development economics

2024
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:23,159
especially from the early 1970s onwards

2025
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:25,080
an article always references the one by

2026
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,460
Keith Hart in formal income

2027
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,139
opportunities in urban employment in

2028
01:27:28,139 --> 01:27:30,780
Ghana and the title itself already makes

2029
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:33,780
pretty clear what uh well where he

2030
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,520
stands and what the topic is right it is

2031
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,320
really about local labor markets it's

2032
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,480
about Local Economic Development yeah

2033
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,880
but what did Keith Hart and many others

2034
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,820
with him argue there is a lot of and I

2035
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:46,440
think it's something that maybe julvin

2036
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,120
Hammond is lecture for European cities

2037
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,980
in an organizing World also picked up on

2038
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:52,860
what is registered to be part of the

2039
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:55,380
economy is only part of what is what

2040
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,239
what we should consider as economic

2041
01:27:57,239 --> 01:27:59,580
activities yeah so we have formal

2042
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:02,699
economic practices businesses that pay

2043
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:04,199
taxes and that are registered as

2044
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:06,179
businesses but there's a lot of

2045
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:08,820
employment Beyond these forward economic

2046
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:11,639
practices so beyond governments Beyond

2047
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:13,679
firms Beyond factories Beyond

2048
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:16,620
large-scale Commerce yeah so this is

2049
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:18,360
where the distinction between informal

2050
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,699
and formal comes from yeah

2051
01:28:20,699 --> 01:28:23,760
so this is important to keep in mind

2052
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,340
this of course gets slippery because in

2053
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,540
some literature

2054
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,520
this and this comes together right then

2055
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,020
you say well actually the informal is

2056
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:33,060
illegitimate and the formal is the

2057
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,219
legitimate but that is only partial or

2058
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:36,780
partially true I mean we can have a

2059
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:38,400
discussion about what's legitimate

2060
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,500
unless for example say we'll we'll all

2061
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,380
agree that someone taking care at all of

2062
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,940
their children because the constitutes

2063
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:47,760
work but we I think we also all agree

2064
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,880
that this is not illegitimate

2065
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,820
well far from it right so whereas drug

2066
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:57,060
trafficking uh is probably informal

2067
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,760
because it's not registered as such but

2068
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,920
many would also consider it illegitimate

2069
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,420
again we can have a discussion on this

2070
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:04,980
if that makes sense that distinction

2071
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,659
yeah

2072
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:08,699
now this is how to constantly merged and

2073
01:29:08,699 --> 01:29:10,020
this is interesting because this is one

2074
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,360
of the not few cars but one of the key

2075
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,820
Concepts that have really traveled from

2076
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:17,280
the global South to Global North yeah so

2077
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,840
this is where work that emerged most

2078
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,540
forcefully in research on the global

2079
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,580
South yeah and this is terminology

2080
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,340
that's really sort of it traveled

2081
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,800
it doesn't happen too often you could

2082
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,420
say

2083
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,280
so I mean in terms such as post-modern

2084
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,840
urbanism in a way is the opposite

2085
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,260
example

2086
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,780
apparently

2087
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,600
I'll just check in just one sec

2088
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,580
now in urban anthropology if you look at

2089
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:51,920
informality

2090
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,300
it leads to a lot of research on

2091
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,060
opportunities but also precarious uh

2092
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,340
precarities created by unregulated

2093
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:01,620
economic activities so there's a strong

2094
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:04,500
interest in gender Dimensions so people

2095
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,320
women working on markets working at home

2096
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,000
so this is really about let's say what

2097
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,739
what the bread and butter of a lot of

2098
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,120
urban anthropology

2099
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,100
as well as transnational Dimensions

2100
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,659
particularly this Dimension I think has

2101
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:17,400
been picked up most most clearly in

2102
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,620
let's say the more cultural work uh in

2103
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,020
urban studies so for example many Street

2104
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,520
vendors also being transnational

2105
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,920
migrants hearing a picture of LA rambla

2106
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,920
and Barcelona so illegal migrants doing

2107
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,320
working on the in the city

2108
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,120
and it raises questions of economic

2109
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,400
survival most obviously but also

2110
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,500
questions of of the governors of these

2111
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,679
markets of of the political identity of

2112
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:42,120
these actors or the cultural social

2113
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:44,520
identity of these actors and with a

2114
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,320
nervous studies is a particular this

2115
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,880
strand of research which has really led

2116
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,100
to a boom I think of research and

2117
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:53,100
informal uh on informal urbanism yeah

2118
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,139
I'll pick up some of these elements in

2119
01:30:55,139 --> 01:30:57,420
my lecture uh next week

2120
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,340
now that's very brief I mean I could

2121
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,260
have two three lectures for sure on

2122
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,420
informality as a concept as a practice

2123
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,100
and how it's picked up in different

2124
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,199
strands of research just as a kind of

2125
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:08,820
stepping stone please understand this as

2126
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,800
a stepping stone to let's say the more

2127
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,420
contemporary research that I will

2128
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:15,360
discuss next week the second strand of

2129
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,760
research which hasn't been much part of

2130
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,320
let's see the poorest Modern urbanism

2131
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:22,320
Trend the symbolic economy trance is the

2132
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,719
literature on everyday life I myself

2133
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:26,639
have been partially trained in cultural

2134
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,400
studies and everyday life was a concept

2135
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,139
that popped up that this was like

2136
01:31:31,139 --> 01:31:32,880
regularly used all the time from the

2137
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,540
late 1980s 1990s onwards it was really

2138
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:40,500
used as a key as a key uh well topic

2139
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,679
what does the term basically entail in

2140
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,360
most cases because ultimately it's also

2141
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,860
not more than a buzzword there's a lot

2142
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:49,139
of theory behind it yeah but ultimately

2143
01:31:49,139 --> 01:31:51,179
it entails a key concern with Lyft

2144
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:53,639
experiences of people and the meanings

2145
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:56,100
constructed by subjects in their own

2146
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:59,280
world so classic cultural concerns if

2147
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,920
you wish yeah

2148
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:04,139
so most of this leisure in in in

2149
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:07,139
cultural studies on everyday life tends

2150
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:09,480
to also position people as active agents

2151
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,400
rather than as passive consumers or

2152
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,400
passive recipients of political power so

2153
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,960
this automatically leads to this kind of

2154
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,020
debate on strategies versus tactics and

2155
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,000
so the resistance people can have on the

2156
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,400
ground in relation to see the structures

2157
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,380
they are confronted they are well they

2158
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:27,120
are confronted with

2159
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,260
um

2160
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:30,239
I'll skip this part because there's also

2161
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,820
another part in anthropology which also

2162
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,980
addresses this

2163
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,840
um

2164
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,699
and this also makes I think the everyday

2165
01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:41,219
a truly transdisciplinary concept I mean

2166
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:43,020
again there are not too many Concepts

2167
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,360
that are truly transdisciplinary I try

2168
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,920
to understand Urban studies as a

2169
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,300
discipline that is much broader than

2170
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,040
specific disciplinary debates because

2171
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,719
it's just very boring to stick to one

2172
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:54,120
discipline yeah but the everyday has

2173
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:57,060
really emerged from the 1970s 1980s and

2174
01:32:57,060 --> 01:32:59,460
as a truly transdisciplinary concept so

2175
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:01,500
again similar to the postmodern I think

2176
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,600
a question that was raised at the back

2177
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,480
there is no such thing as one postmodern

2178
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,460
if you look at different disciplines the

2179
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:10,260
way they understand the postmodern it's

2180
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,420
quite substantially different and

2181
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,340
sometimes even contradictory the same

2182
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,860
applies to the everyday yeah but one

2183
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:18,480
discipline or one other says about D

2184
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,360
every day might not overlap to a great

2185
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,159
degree with what another author writes

2186
01:33:23,159 --> 01:33:24,480
about you every day so you really have

2187
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,699
to look at disciplinary specifics in

2188
01:33:26,699 --> 01:33:28,620
order to understand it nevertheless

2189
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:31,920
there are it is it has emerged as a as a

2190
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,440
term as a concept it really connects

2191
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,360
cultural Theory with philosophy with

2192
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,460
Marxist is an ethnography with

2193
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:40,500
post-structuralism with sociology and

2194
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,659
with Aesthetics yeah so the many

2195
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,820
interesting let's see entry points also

2196
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:47,580
for you so for a study specifically next

2197
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,460
to an unavoidable

2198
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:52,739
uh the everyday who sees the everyday as

2199
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:55,500
a side of utopian possibility but also

2200
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,239
colonized by the commodity form so

2201
01:33:57,239 --> 01:33:58,920
that's commodity Aesthetics once again

2202
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,500
you'll I can only urge you I mean of

2203
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,820
course I'm not really fair is great we

2204
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:05,460
all like him Etc but there's also a lot

2205
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:06,719
of interesting work that has been done

2206
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:08,639
by other artists which is perhaps

2207
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,920
at least as relevant let's put it in

2208
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,719
those terms uh then then I'll really

2209
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,300
forever so please no no no no no more

2210
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,440
papers on the right to the city I've

2211
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:19,699
read enough of those that's

2212
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:21,600
for example Stuart Hall and Tony

2213
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,639
Jefferson classic British cultural

2214
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:25,560
studies uh some of you might be familiar

2215
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,719
with this over their work our special

2216
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:30,300
Stuart Hall I mean if not do read this

2217
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,219
work because it's pretty well it's very

2218
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:33,300
very good

2219
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,460
we're really looked looked at let's say

2220
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:37,980
subcultures every day as a symbolic

2221
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,840
opposition to a dominant order

2222
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,000
I'll just mention some keywords that top

2223
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,679
up here but this is terminology I think

2224
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:45,080
which has become

2225
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,219
internalized and much of her thinking

2226
01:34:47,219 --> 01:34:50,100
about Urban cultures resistance style

2227
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,800
social practices subcultures growth

2228
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,159
codes Urban use identity yeah

2229
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,260
terminology that was not

2230
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:00,480
used for the first time by Stuart Hall

2231
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,400
and others but they really theorized it

2232
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,900
and they really did something new with

2233
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,340
it yeah

2234
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:08,100
one caveat of forces especially early

2235
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,560
cultural studies work it was highly

2236
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:13,860
blind to gender the gender Dynamics yeah

2237
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:16,080
this was I mean the picture shows that

2238
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,300
it was used subculture was very much

2239
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:21,179
around male use subconscious yeah this

2240
01:35:21,179 --> 01:35:22,800
has partially been addressed by by

2241
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,679
artists such as Angeline like Robbie uh

2242
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,840
who's actually my my first PhD

2243
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,360
supervisor and feminist cultural studies

2244
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:33,300
but certainly let's say it kind of

2245
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,980
um underlying Trend in the early

2246
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,360
cultural studies tradition that it was

2247
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,940
pretty blind to to gender issues or also

2248
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,380
partially intersectional other

2249
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:42,300
intersection issues

2250
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,520
from quite a different angle but again

2251
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,860
it made an amazing book if I didn't book

2252
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:48,480
you could easily read it it's very well

2253
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,300
written the practice of Everyday Life by

2254
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:53,219
Michel de Certo

2255
01:35:53,219 --> 01:35:54,020
um

2256
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,400
translation obviously I think the French

2257
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,159
is uh maybe 10 years older already the

2258
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:00,480
original

2259
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,780
um more poetic but maybe focused on

2260
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:07,139
tactics tactics versus strategies uh so

2261
01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:09,360
the idea being that strategies are top

2262
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,639
down and people on the street they sort

2263
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:14,100
of engage with this and develop tactics

2264
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:15,659
in order to avoid

2265
01:36:15,659 --> 01:36:17,880
State strategies mostly government

2266
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:21,679
strategies so tactics are situated

2267
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:23,520
tactics as

2268
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,199
as

2269
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:26,820
resisting uh let's say broader

2270
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,739
structures this again is very much

2271
01:36:28,739 --> 01:36:30,420
shaped I'm not saying that everything is

2272
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:31,440
good about it because it's too

2273
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,739
dichotomous but it's a very

2274
01:36:33,739 --> 01:36:36,420
influential book that has really shaped

2275
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:38,639
much of the debate that form so next

2276
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,320
week I'll talk a bit more about let's

2277
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,239
say from the everyday to cultural work

2278
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,880
and activism a bit more about DIY

2279
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,239
urbanism where some of the DIY urbanism

2280
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,400
literature for example implicitly or

2281
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,080
explicitly refers to the type of stuff

2282
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:56,120
that is adored it already in 1980s

2283
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,400
okay

2284
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,540
just to conclude

2285
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:03,840
um

2286
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,820
as I mentioned the cultural tournament

2287
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,280
is to be understood as part of a wider

2288
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,380
shift in analytical sensibilities in the

2289
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:12,239
social sciences yeah

2290
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,980
I mean at the very beginning I said okay

2291
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:16,199
there's the empirical theoretical and

2292
01:37:16,199 --> 01:37:19,260
the methodological these are three takes

2293
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:22,320
on how we are how at that point we

2294
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,020
started looking differently at the world

2295
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,460
yeah

2296
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:30,179
so urban geography itself as one strand

2297
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:32,760
of debate within this broader cultural

2298
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,940
turn uh was and is I would argue heavily

2299
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:37,800
influenced by a Marxist or at least

2300
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,020
political economic interpretation of

2301
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,060
post-modernism as the cultural

2302
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,719
expression of late capitalism yeah

2303
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,860
you can also phrase it differently

2304
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:50,100
there's very little subtle Nuance

2305
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:53,300
cultural readings of let's say symbolic

2306
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,560
objects such as the Arts in urban

2307
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,360
geography for that mostly you have to

2308
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,639
move outside of geography because it

2309
01:37:59,639 --> 01:38:02,280
does not have this history of taking

2310
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,960
subtly about let's say cultural

2311
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,239
expressions yeah which doesn't mean it's

2312
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:07,920
not good but it's limited in that

2313
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,380
respect the work and symbol of economy

2314
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:12,300
in a way Builds on this but it has

2315
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:14,159
shifted the tension a bit more to

2316
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,800
questions of representation uh to urban

2317
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,960
lifestyles and cultural production yeah

2318
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,780
so the post-modern urbanism school was

2319
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:24,719
wasn't interested that much in artists

2320
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,540
producing actual pieces of work actual

2321
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,159
art that was most interested in

2322
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:31,080
consumption yeah so the commodity a

2323
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:32,880
study said yeah you buy something with

2324
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,500
which you identify as a lifestyle

2325
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:35,820
question

2326
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,460
and this is the last part that I discuss

2327
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,380
we see an increasing or we saw an

2328
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:43,440
increasing more in a sort of meeting in

2329
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,480
a halfway between urban geography

2330
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,639
cultural studies and anthropology as

2331
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:49,860
part of a broader spatial term so this

2332
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,239
is the funniest thing the interesting

2333
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:53,159
thing is that this cultural turn often

2334
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:55,739
also until the spatial turn yeah it came

2335
01:38:55,739 --> 01:38:59,159
it must emerge together in many ways

2336
01:38:59,159 --> 01:39:01,020
last point that I discuss is the

2337
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,520
research and informality in everyday

2338
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:05,280
life and related concerns as enormously

2339
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,860
contributed to a development of a truly

2340
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:09,900
interdisciplinary transdisciplinary form

2341
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:11,699
of cultural Urban studies I think these

2342
01:39:11,699 --> 01:39:13,320
are some of the some you see this

2343
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,239
happening in in the social science in

2344
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:16,199
the United States at large is that

2345
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:19,199
certain Concepts just resonate with

2346
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:20,760
research is coming from very different

2347
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:22,620
traditions and they become let's say

2348
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:24,719
bridging Concepts that bring together

2349
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:27,300
very different ways of thinking very

2350
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:29,280
different histories of writing and this

2351
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,500
is where uh most of them well the most

2352
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:34,199
exciting stuff happens I would argue

2353
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:37,139
okay next week uh this is what I will

2354
01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:38,699
try to discuss

2355
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:42,000
um so today my main claim is history

2356
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,100
matters so the history of urban studies

2357
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,199
that I just discussed shapes also

2358
01:39:46,199 --> 01:39:47,699
current research debates on Urban

2359
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:50,699
cultures and the four strands I will try

2360
01:39:50,699 --> 01:39:52,860
to discuss with you next week uh

2361
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,960
certainly so it is more but I do think

2362
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,600
that this is a pretty exhaustive at the

2363
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,900
same time are one on the Arts activism

2364
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,520
and urban engagement

2365
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,739
this wants to add the second one

2366
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:06,239
specifically focusing on cultural

2367
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:08,460
infrastructures and informal urbanism

2368
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:10,080
probably a bit more on the cultural

2369
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,719
infrastructure site in the informal side

2370
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:14,280
a third one on Urban tourism and

2371
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,840
consumption cultures

2372
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,880
and a fourth one

2373
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:20,280
which links most closely to the

2374
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,020
methodological concerns perhaps it also

2375
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:23,820
is empirical at the same time

2376
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,920
focusing on sensory urbanism so

2377
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,659
different kinds of let's say engaging

2378
01:40:27,659 --> 01:40:30,000
with the urban beyond the visual and and

2379
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,780
text uh again there's only so much I can

2380
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:35,280
do in the two hours that I have next

2381
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,780
week but hopefully this gives you a

2382
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:39,960
pretty good overview of what

2383
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,699
um cultures of urban research and urban

2384
01:40:41,699 --> 01:40:44,580
cultures can be about okay I'll leave it

2385
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,440
there and I'm very fast for today any

2386
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,520
questions

2387
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,040
no everyone happy to go home at quarter

2388
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,679
to seven on a Monday evening then I will

2389
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:54,000
see you next week if I don't see you

2390
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,120
before

# 7 Urban cultures

1
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,400
I'll start recording immediately because

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,919
I forgot to start recording for the

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,599
lecture of Claire at least for part of

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,880
it let me see here

5
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,280
all right can everyone hear me

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,879
yeah I see shaking ass that's good

7
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,740
I now also open to chats I finally found

8
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,439
out how to deal with the chat while

9
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,380
being in a formal uh presenting mode

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,380
um I think it's about time to start

11
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,320
um welcome to the second lecture for

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,540
um Urban social geography where I'll be

13
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,960
spend in the next two hours uh let's see

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,200
if yeah how how much time we need

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
um for election Urban cultures so um as

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,420
you remember in the last session I

17
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,100
largely gave a historical overview of

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,200
what I consider to be essential let's

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
say core coordinates of thinking about

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,380
culture in urban geography and more

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,420
widely some other let's say related

22
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,880
disciplines starting with a brief

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,979
discussion well but it's a relatively

24
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,960
specific discussion on Frederick Jameson

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,659
and his notion of post-modernism moving

26
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,119
to the shift of moving to let's say the

27
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,640
1980s early 1990s debate on um

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,840
post-modern urbanism and the LA School

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,719
of urbanism and then shifting to a to a

30
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,758
wider or but also related debate on the

31
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,860
symbolic economy those were the key

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,200
coordinates that I tried to to get

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,620
across one of the questions well you

34
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,420
can't see the slides can can everyone

35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,420
see the slides oh that's odd thank you

36
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,400
for asking the question because I'm

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,580
actually screen sharing now

38
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,640
um let me just see I'll just

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,220
stop share you should be able to see the

40
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,840
slides

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,700
another sec

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,700
um

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,819
share screen

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,080
I'll do it like this done simply this

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,280
just a sec

46
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,180
okay you now see my screen

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,700
except that I can't see you now just a

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,959
sec

49
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,379
this is odds uh one here we are

50
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,700
yeah never see the slides now

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,860
I see you one yes thank you so I hope

52
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,280
that's okay perfect okay yes okay thanks

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
a lot yeah feel free to unmute sometimes

54
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,840
that's easier than uh than working with

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,120
uh sign language

56
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,980
um the only thing is I can't see you now

57
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,019
let me see

58
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,959
um where is that

59
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,000
just want to say ah here we are okay now

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,560
I see you and hopefully you see me and

61
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,599
we see the slides you did hear what I

62
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,459
was saying right so okay let's let's

63
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,560
keep it from there

64
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,959
um so what I try to get across last week

65
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,819
is what I just discussed I tried to give

66
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,379
an historical overview of some of the

67
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,879
core elements that I thought I think

68
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,680
were are important thinking about Urban

69
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,080
culture over the last 30 40 years

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,180
actually oh and some people are in the

71
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,260
waiting room

72
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,580
my life is so so easy let me see

73
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,120
[Music]

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,700
before you start working here where are

75
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,340
we no no no no

76
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,319
um I'll stop sharing again that will

77
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,000
admit all again

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,440
but at some point it becomes a bit

79
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,120
tricky then people just have to wait for

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,280
the last the next uh

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,739
the next pause is otherwise it becomes

82
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,720
difficult because with the session of

83
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,280
clear I could actually manage this but

84
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,079
since I don't have an assistant next to

85
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,660
me this is uh what we'll work with Okay

86
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,820
next round we'll we'll go for another

87
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,840
run here we go uh

88
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,360
chat

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,740
and start

90
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,060
and now I just need to slip this

91
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,699
do we disadvantage that I don't see you

92
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,900
anymore ah here we are there we are

93
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,759
okay getting there

94
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,180
so for the third time uh I tried to give

95
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,560
an historical overview one of the

96
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,180
questions I received last week is okay

97
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,100
are we going to learn more about actual

98
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,680
cultures so cultural expressions stuff

99
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,560
that interests interests us as 20 20

100
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,300
year olds 20 year olds that's what I

101
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,460
remember so the question to the answer

102
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,740
to that question is yes uh in the

103
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,620
session today I will focus a bit more in

104
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,840
detail on specific well I I will always

105
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,620
focus on research on Urban culture but

106
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,540
look at zooming in more specifically on

107
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,280
Research that looks at actual cultural

108
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,259
expressions but always from the

109
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,180
perspective as to how this has been done

110
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,580
in urban studies there are many other

111
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,139
disciplines of course that focus on

112
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,360
culture or cultural expressions coming

113
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,220
from the humanities in particular

114
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,500
but I will largely zoom in on how this

115
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,419
has been approached within within Urban

116
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,039
studies

117
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,699
um

118
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,979
that will hopefully become clear or

119
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,780
clearer in a minute

120
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,120
before doing so I have I want to broaden

121
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,860
the debate a bit beyond urban geography

122
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,960
per se and and I show some of the slides

123
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,340
and discuss some of the slides that I

124
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,340
also already mentioned uh last uh last

125
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,900
week

126
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,300
because if you look at the way urban

127
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,759
geography has has undergone its own

128
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,220
cultural turn as I'm as I hinted at last

129
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,560
week what we saw happening in in

130
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,240
parallel is that many other disciplines

131
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,740
within the social science the humanities

132
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,840
have also undergone a kind of spatial

133
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,820
turn so we've seen a kind of meeting

134
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,280
halfway a kind of rakash more between

135
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,139
geography becoming a more cultural

136
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,120
discipline but other disciplines also

137
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,759
becoming more cultural becoming more

138
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,840
geographical becoming more spatial

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,400
um so this cultural this spatial turn

140
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,380
had a number of reasons as I already

141
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,660
mentioned I think last week one of them

142
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,240
being a post 1989 obsession with

143
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,220
globalization so the moment you start

144
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,960
thinking seriously about globalization

145
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,880
you quasi-automatically start thinking

146
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,280
about spatial issues about geographical

147
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,380
issues because what if it's here but

148
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,120
also somewhere else you start thinking

149
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,500
about Connections

150
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,300
the other one being a kind of critique

151
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,160
of modernity which had really shaped I

152
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,479
think most of the social science and

153
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,120
Humanities debates up until the 1970s

154
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,419
which primarily sort of uh paid

155
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,160
attention to temporal issues to time

156
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,539
because that's the very logic of

157
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,840
thinking in terms of modernity so what

158
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,539
we've seen over the years since the late

159
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,759
1970s roughly speaking is we see this

160
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,100
kind of de-emphasizing us of temporal

161
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,500
issues and emphasizing

162
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,620
uh of of spatial issues and this is

163
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,120
where the let's see the spatial turn

164
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,880
comes in so this in turn and this is

165
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,620
what I want to briefly focus on for the

166
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,080
opening of this today's session led to

167
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
an increased interaction between urban

168
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,560
geography Urban anthropology and

169
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,840
cultural studies many other disciplines

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,400
also but for me those are some of the

171
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,620
core disciplines that really

172
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,919
um shaped I think the future of uh of us

173
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,020
the the the the research on Urban

174
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,580
culture at Large

175
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,199
now there are

176
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,960
a number of core teams in urban

177
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,120
anthropology and and or cultural studies

178
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
that have shaped the late 20th century

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,639
early 21st century trajectory of what I

180
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,419
consider to be let's say

181
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,120
interdisciplinary Urban studies I'm not

182
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,740
going to give a review here of urban

183
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,660
anthropology or cultural studies they're

184
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,300
both fascinating disciplines I learned a

185
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,699
lot from both disciplines

186
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,020
um I mean I was trained in cultural

187
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,639
studies myself before becoming a

188
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,560
geographer you could say

189
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,960
um but there are two let's say teams

190
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,599
that I want to briefly flag here which I

191
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,440
think

192
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,620
um I have a much longer history in in in

193
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,900
anthropology and cultural studies but

194
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,000
have which have really been picked up in

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,979
in into this finale Urban studies and

196
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,900
shaped this debate up to the present day

197
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,200
the first debate uh being around what I

198
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,059
label here is informality

199
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,740
it's the kind of debate that that

200
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,620
emerged in anthropology and and

201
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,200
development studies largely focusing on

202
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,180
informal economy labor markets

203
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,640
precarious work migration issues of

204
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,100
workers legality and illegality

205
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,959
distinction but also the regulation so

206
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,480
the political governance of uh of

207
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,580
informality I'll give a few examples in

208
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,360
a minute

209
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,339
the second core team that I think is

210
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,680
important to to keep in mind as a kind

211
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,480
of understanding of the history of

212
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,880
research on Urban culture is research on

213
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,820
everyday life that's a term that is you

214
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,380
don't see the term used that much

215
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,600
anymore I would say in the last 10 years

216
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,760
or so you still see it a lot but then

217
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,279
less so as a theoretical concept but it

218
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,899
was it was a term that was pretty much

219
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,600
dominant almost in dominance in the

220
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,620
1980s 1990s 2000s largely used as a kind

221
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,480
of shorthand or a kind of buzzword for

222
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,100
referring to issues around agency

223
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,920
community community building also

224
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,260
resistance issues as well as consumption

225
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,000
and identity questions and related

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,700
representational questions which then in

227
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,740
turn uh had an often a lot to do with

228
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,899
how things were represented in in media

229
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,700
so everyday life

230
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,560
refers to many things just as

231
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,240
informality refers to many things but if

232
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
you would have to give a kind of

233
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,660
nutshell summary this slide pretty much

234
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,560
covers it I think

235
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,940
now briefly if you think about

236
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,300
informality within biology Urban

237
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,740
anthropology and development studies

238
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,200
it's a term that is last was less use in

239
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,100
in cultural studies it's a classic team

240
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,779
especially from the early 1970s onwards

241
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,420
the the core reference and perhaps uh

242
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,820
the the first person who coined the idea

243
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,399
of the informal economy that many others

244
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,660
of course who did research on the

245
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,820
informal economy without labeling it as

246
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,700
such was key to heart and one of the

247
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,140
classic articles or one of the first

248
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,720
articles there is this article from 1973

249
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,060
which is titled informal income

250
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,860
opportunities and urban employment in

251
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,140
Ghana now the article is actually case

252
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,680
study as such is less relevant than

253
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,720
um than the understanding as to what he

254
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,519
coined in this article how this is

255
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,220
shaped let's say subsequent debates so

256
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,320
heart primarily focused on a number of

257
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,620
things you focused on actual employment

258
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,899
so people making a living beyond

259
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,060
government jobs Beyond factories and

260
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,519
Beyond large-scale companies yeah I said

261
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,500
okay there's a whole world out there of

262
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,779
how people make a living especially in

263
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,579
Ghana but he then sort of extrapolated

264
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,980
this through Urban Africa at large say

265
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,660
okay there's a whole world out there of

266
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,839
work that we actually don't see we don't

267
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,640
capture it we don't matter we don't see

268
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,380
it because we don't have the vocabulary

269
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,899
to really pay attention to it

270
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,820
so that's that's the first observation

271
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,579
he makes there yeah that makes it uh he

272
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,779
bases this on a distinction between

273
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,820
informal and formally where he says well

274
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,459
all the vocabulary that we have is

275
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,019
largely catering to especially from

276
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,360
economics to capturing registering and

277
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,760
registering and measuring uh formal

278
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,519
labor so labor that actually shows up in

279
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,640
in GDP uh values Etc yeah labor that is

280
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,579
actually taxed and a lot of the labor

281
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,680
that we see in urban Africa you argued

282
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,720
is not taxed as such or we don't see it

283
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,220
for that reason

284
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,260
so he introduced the distinction

285
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,720
informal labor formal economy formal

286
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,079
employment and informal employment

287
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,820
he also then makes a distinction between

288
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,680
illegitimate and legitimate labor where

289
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,320
he said okay legitimate activity which

290
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,940
is not the same as informal and formal

291
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,700
he says okay we can have informal

292
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,459
activity according to him so economic

293
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,220
activity which is not measured as such

294
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,779
which is still legitimate which he then

295
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,820
argues those are activities that do

296
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,160
actually make a contribution to economic

297
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,040
growth but at a small scale so if you

298
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,720
let's say uh sell uh uh Foods on on a

299
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
local market but this is not this is not

300
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,440
captured you're not registered as an

301
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,480
official business this according to them

302
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,640
is legitimate in for a legitimate

303
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,920
informal activity which I think most of

304
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,019
us can actually agree with and then

305
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,360
there's illegitimate informal activity

306
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,399
where he says well that can refer to

307
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,260
criminal activities but also for example

308
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,260
to bagging or bribery or corruption

309
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,260
which he considers to be a illegitimate

310
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,240
so there's a kind of fourfold

311
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,519
Distinction which is uh which has really

312
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,019
shaped the thing to debate and you can

313
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,940
question and disagree with some of the

314
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,160
species of his arguments but the way he

315
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,560
structured this idea has uh has been

316
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,000
quite important

317
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
now I mentioned this here not because I

318
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,660
want to discuss with you Urban Africa or

319
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,019
1973 Keith Hart but because I think some

320
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,940
of the the let's see the landmark

321
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,740
studies that he and others have done in

322
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,320
the early 1970s have informed the

323
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,180
debates that followed elsewhere

324
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,100
informality is an interesting concept

325
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,839
because it's one of the few Concepts You

326
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,120
could argue that has really seen a

327
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,740
concept travel from the global styles to

328
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,320
the global North so where most of us are

329
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,300
very well aware of critiques to what

330
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,860
let's say Urban studies saying well it's

331
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,480
actually eurocentric or at least Western

332
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,700
Centric informality is one of those

333
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,459
Concepts which you could say started in

334
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,260
the global South and actually has been

335
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,820
picked up increasingly in order to

336
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,680
understand also practices within the

337
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,959
global North to such an extent I would

338
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,579
argue that as one of the few Concepts

339
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,380
which really transcends this kind of

340
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,540
global style Global nor divides and

341
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,100
really sort of contributes to thinking

342
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,560
in terms of a global Urban studies so if

343
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,240
you look at work for example of of

344
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,880
ananya Roy or Jennifer Roberson they've

345
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,980
picked up on the on the informality

346
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,260
topic as a way of also thinking about

347
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,000
Urban studies in more Global terms

348
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,560
without being being let's say

349
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,200
eurocentric or Western Centric

350
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,000
um there are all kinds of related terms

351
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
and they all have to do let's say this

352
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,279
disciplinary specifics that are pretty

353
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,079
much try to cover the same field but I

354
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,880
won't discuss here such as unregistered

355
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,639
economy Black Market the non-observed

356
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,920
economy Undeclared work or the Shadow or

357
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,680
hidden economy and for those that say

358
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,060
more trained and feminist Theory it's

359
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,800
quite obvious let's say that the

360
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,959
distinction between informal and formal

361
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,600
but actually also maps on to the

362
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,040
distinction between public and private

363
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,100
with public with public activities often

364
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,779
being seen as part of the former economy

365
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,519
but let's say private activities such as

366
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,920
care work being seen as the informal

367
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,260
economy often also not measured and thus

368
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,260
supposedly not worthy of attention yeah

369
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,019
and of course this is as overlapped and

370
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,180
and been involved in rethinking the

371
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,980
terms of that debate to an important

372
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,639
extent also

373
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,320
so on Urban anthropology when thinking

374
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,180
about informality you get the research

375
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,279
on the opportunities but also precarious

376
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,139
created by unregulated economic

377
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,600
activities uh I will give some examples

378
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,279
later but it's quite obvious for example

379
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,199
if we fast forward let's say to research

380
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,240
on creative and cultural Industries and

381
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,100
research that is now being done on

382
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,980
precarious uh precarious uh artistic

383
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,620
labor for example it's it's it struggles

384
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,600
with a similar attention where to a

385
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,399
large extent artistic labor is also

386
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,500
unregulated which creates all kinds of

387
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,779
freedoms and opportunities but is at the

388
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:34,860
same time this let's say this

389
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,019
unregulated nature which makes it very

390
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,820
precarious because there's no way you

391
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,040
can actually support or let's say where

392
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
a state or a welfare state of other

393
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,300
mechanisms can actually structure the

394
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,639
kind of economic activities

395
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,920
Urban anthropology historically speaking

396
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,420
has also seen a strong interest in the

397
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,600
gender dimensions of informal works I've

398
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,820
already hinted at this partially in the

399
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,220
home situation partially mostly females

400
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,279
being women working on markets Etc so

401
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,800
all kinds of uh gendered in exclusions

402
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,839
that are part of this discussion and

403
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,940
again these have shaped debates in the

404
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,639
in the decades that followed

405
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,199
also important things that Urban

406
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,779
anthropology we see informality being

407
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,100
linked strongly to transnational

408
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,560
Dimensions yeah so with the idea that

409
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,860
informal uh labor market in formal Urban

410
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,480
labor markets are often also highly

411
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,240
transnational labor markets on one level

412
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,279
with

413
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,660
diaspora connections people sending back

414
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,579
their their their earnings or part of

415
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,800
their earnings to their home country but

416
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,060
also with many migrants actually

417
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,459
occupying in former labor markets in in

418
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,500
country in cities across the world so

419
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,579
there's a kind of transnational

420
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,440
connection which urban anthropology

421
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,720
certainly was among the first uh to pay

422
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,240
uh to pay attention to oh which has seen

423
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,820
an increasing amount of research in in

424
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,800
urban and interdisciplinary Urban

425
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,839
studies

426
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,000
to use an example of the mandir was in

427
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Barcelona for example who often have an

428
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,620
African background uh and who have who

429
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,480
live in relatively precarious situations

430
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,400
well very precarious situation in Spain

431
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,980
being sort of legal illegal semi-legal

432
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,959
in different different kinds of statuses

433
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,959
and trying to make a living uh in in

434
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,319
this case Barcelona

435
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,880
so that's a five minute summary of a 40

436
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,099
40-year debate in urban anthropology so

437
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,500
apologies for any sort of uh lack of

438
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,599
selfies but my discussion is relatively

439
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,700
instrumental here and that I want to get

440
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
across some of the key uh let's say

441
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,039
conceptual elements uh conceptual

442
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,200
nuggets you could say that that should

443
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,000
also shape debate and interdisciplinary

444
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,059
Urban studies a second term that that

445
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,880
I'm sure you've come across before in in

446
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,679
your reading is everyday life

447
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,820
now but wasn't anthropology but

448
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,799
especially I think in cultural studies

449
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,900
this notion of everyday life really

450
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,299
shaped the debate and and and signifies

451
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,640
in many ways a concern with the lift

452
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,500
experiences and meanings constructed by

453
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,900
subjects in their own worlds

454
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,240
um partially emerging you could save in

455
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,059
in the 1970s as a chronic critique of

456
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,039
supposedly structuralist Marxist theory

457
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,260
paying more attention to agency so it's

458
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,380
part of that 1970s 1980s debate but then

459
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,840
also um

460
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,039
increasingly moving into a let's say

461
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,020
substantive Empirical research

462
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,940
where uh where research started paying

463
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,559
attention to the actual lift experiences

464
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,580
and the meanings of of people yeah so

465
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,380
people as active creative agents rather

466
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,780
than as passive consumers uh this is

467
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,280
kind of what the the broad

468
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,620
interdisciplinary sprawling debate of

469
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,360
everyday life uh signifies

470
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,900
now there are many

471
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,880
I think within different supplies that

472
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,559
have in one way or another try to engage

473
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,480
with everyday life with or without using

474
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,700
the concept one which I will only hint

475
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,400
at I think here but which might be

476
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,500
discussed in some more detail by those

477
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,720
that follow not I know what not everyone

478
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,820
does but depending on your program those

479
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,620
that follow Urban sociology of Ava

480
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,020
swimkidao there's a kind of tradition of

481
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,640
community studies and anthropology and

482
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,799
cultural studies which historically has

483
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,539
focused on participant observation and

484
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,160
extensive periods of field work to

485
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,780
really gain trust and insight knowledge

486
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,240
of everyday practices so basically an

487
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,919
anthropological stance you could say you

488
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,919
become part of a community and only

489
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,780
through this inside knowledge you will

490
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,880
actually understand the meanings and and

491
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,380
interpretations attached to certain

492
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,640
practices

493
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,679
it of course also has a history going

494
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,600
back to the Chicago school with research

495
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,179
on also ethnographic research on on

496
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,700
urban areas and various let's say Urban

497
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,799
topics such as gangs ethnic segregation

498
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,660
lifestyle delinquency

499
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,820
but there's also a rural connection

500
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,220
whereas especially within our sociology

501
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,620
let's say partially in parallel to the

502
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,000
Chicago school which was always more

503
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,520
urban in its orientation where some

504
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,380
classic Community studies especially in

505
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,080
the 1950s and 1960s

506
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,820
um sort of started applying you could

507
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,559
say rural concepts of classic Community

508
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,500
studies to Urban settings so look going

509
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,780
into a supposed community in an urban

510
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,640
setting and then focusing on let's say

511
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,460
family and kinship relations or

512
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,980
traditions and rituals yeah this kind of

513
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,720
community studies literature has been

514
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,600
quite heavily criticized over the years

515
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,820
largely for being too localists or for

516
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,320
assuming Community as relatively

517
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,360
homogeneous which was already

518
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,179
problematic you would say in a in a

519
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,100
rural setting but certainly you is

520
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,799
problematic in a much more dynamic

521
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,240
dynamic Urban setting so this idea that

522
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,120
communities actually share same values

523
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,640
was increasingly questioned but the

524
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,500
tradition there of let's say focusing on

525
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,440
everyday life of these communities uh

526
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,539
was already was established by this kind

527
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,539
of uh this kind of literature

528
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,000
excuse me uh there's somebody waiting on

529
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,039
their waiting room let's see because

530
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,020
every time when I have to well I might

531
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,980
be able to do it like this

532
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,039
nope where are we

533
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:02,760
participants here we are okay four more

534
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,020
because I can't do this all the time

535
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,760
because it's quite interrupting so but

536
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,100
I'll now I'll start again

537
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,039
okay you can still see me

538
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,220
perfect now we'll continue

539
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,660
um

540
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,179
so especially from the 1980s onwards I

541
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,280
think we've seen a Revival of the of the

542
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,440
community studies uh that moved beyond

543
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,880
the kind of nostalgic notion of

544
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,200
community and this is where sort of

545
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
again the everyday life uh Notions uh

546
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,400
um well returns in a way or becomes more

547
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,240
present in in in in theorizing uh urban

548
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,860
communities

549
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,900
some basic Trends and again I just

550
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,520
mentioned them here but I think they

551
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
basically still structure the debate up

552
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,260
to this day is that artists started

553
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,940
using conflict theoretical approaches

554
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,260
instead of cohesion theoretical

555
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,659
approaches so looking at

556
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,940
let's say interactions obviously social

557
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,760
interactions between uh actors between

558
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,340
people but also not sort of assuming

559
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,980
let's say cohesion theoretically but

560
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,419
assuming that's the conflict

561
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,179
theoretically you could say very bluntly

562
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,679
speaking you could say instead moving

563
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,360
from a dual Crimean perspective to a

564
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,400
Marxist perspective that's very

565
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,320
simplistic but basically that's is what

566
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,140
covers to a certain extent the debates

567
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,659
also focus on network ties local and

568
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,280
trans local I already mentioned this

569
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,900
with Urban anthropology

570
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,179
uh care and support and unequal and

571
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,820
changing our settings and because of the

572
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,520
let's say the interest in let's say

573
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,539
conflicts and how communities are

574
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,520
constructed not how they I say are

575
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,799
assumed to be there was increasing

576
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,059
interest to let's see the shifting

577
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,860
symbolic boundaries between communities

578
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,380
so the sort of the the making connection

579
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,260
but also making distinctions between uh

580
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,539
between communities and between groups

581
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,400
and that of course then opens up let's

582
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,260
say the base to not just communities as

583
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,620
let's say an aprily facts of social life

584
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,140
but more into debates around communities

585
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,299
of choice and elective belonging so they

586
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,700
can move into subcultures or lgbtqi

587
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,919
communities but also gated communities

588
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,419
for example in urban settings where

589
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,480
people choose to belong to a very

590
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,140
separate community

591
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,080
now the everyday is really a striking uh

592
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,000
coincidence let's say the career of this

593
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,440
concept because it's a truly

594
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,840
transdisciplinary concept perhaps even

595
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,299
more so than uh than the informal or

596
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,580
informality truly transdisciplinary

597
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,679
maybe with a strong Humanity background

598
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,900
but really connecting cultural Theory

599
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,640
with philosophy with Marxism with

600
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,860
ethnography with more structuralism with

601
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,600
sociology and with Aesthetics and that's

602
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,460
that's precisely what makes this concept

603
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,860
I think so interesting or so influential

604
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,799
for research on Urban cultures now you

605
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,120
have to be careful here because the

606
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,460
simple fact that a concept is used and

607
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,140
all these different let's say Traditions

608
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,059
or disciplines doesn't mean of course

609
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,400
that is used in the same way so if you

610
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,080
look for example that's and there's no

611
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,299
no time to discuss this here but if you

612
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,460
look for example that everyday life in

613
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,980
in let's say ethnography it's quite

614
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,299
different than everyday life and

615
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,700
Aesthetics and quite different than

616
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,200
everyday life let's say in more post

617
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,440
post-structural literary Theory yeah

618
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,120
um so you have to be quite careful there

619
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,400
but for every studies I would argue

620
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,679
there are a number of approaches which

621
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,360
have really let's say let's see Eternal

622
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,220
references in a way those those artists

623
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,900
that are continually continuously

624
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,539
referenced one is the unavoidable Humvee

625
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:22,500
Lafayette

626
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,980
everyone references hallway Lafayette

627
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,480
who sees the everyday as a side of

628
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,480
utopian possibility but in in line with

629
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,880
let's say it's Marx's credentials also

630
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,980
sees the everyday as colonized by the

631
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,860
commodity form so a commodification

632
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,500
logic also shaping the everyday that has

633
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,179
been of course Very differential thing

634
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,760
in in in our studies to a large extent

635
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,400
also because it it's pretty compatible

636
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,020
with the kind of critical political

637
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,240
economic Urban studies approach so

638
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,340
people can claim or can become more

639
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,320
interested in culture but don't actually

640
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,760
don't have to leave let's say the house

641
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,740
of political economy too far they can

642
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,140
stay pretty close to that kind of debate

643
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,760
but I would ask you to also pay

644
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,020
attention to other more let's say

645
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,059
perhaps empirically minded research that

646
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,220
was still very theoretical and I can I

647
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,440
will only mention two here which which

648
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,240
have been equally at least influential I

649
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,720
think in in urban studies one being uh

650
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,480
worked by Stuart Hall

651
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,840
um who is a massive towering figure I

652
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,400
think within cultural studies British

653
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,440
cultural studies at least

654
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
um who looks at let's say the everyday

655
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,860
life Elijah tour you could say

656
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,840
especially in this book here which is an

657
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,580
additive book and a compilation of let's

658
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,980
see classic uh papers of the British

659
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,100
cultural studies

660
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,500
Center at that point in time uh to the

661
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,200
looks at it to the subcultural lands and

662
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,000
the notion of subculture was coined by

663
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,179
British cultural studies and even though

664
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,799
subculture is also where we tend not to

665
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,559
use anymore many of the let's say

666
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,340
practices that we assumed to uh to shape

667
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,679
subcultures are with us today so we

668
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,240
might not name them subcultures anymore

669
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,640
we might talk about them it seems or

670
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,799
about the networks or something along

671
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,779
those lines but the idea that

672
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:10,020
subcultures are let's say every day but

673
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,520
also are also kind of symbolic

674
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,500
opposition to a dominant social order

675
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,240
this idea that they're in one way or

676
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,120
another resistance uh is is very

677
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,279
influential I think so if you look at

678
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,020
the literature on let's say subcultures

679
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,840
or let's say neural literature on on

680
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,880
protest movements or let's say clubbing

681
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,580
culture it's it's it still uses these

682
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,500
kinds of this kind of vocabulary

683
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,620
so that then directs attention allows

684
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,320
you to Urban practices of resistance but

685
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,240
also style of fashion of social

686
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,700
practices or the particular codes that

687
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,159
are used within within a community and

688
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,779
interacts attention I think also to a

689
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,100
particular let's say generational

690
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,100
category namely Urban Youth

691
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,380
um which I think was really has always

692
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,700
been a researched in a way but British

693
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,340
cultural studies tradition as as perhaps

694
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,380
directed most of his attention to let's

695
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,320
see this particular category uh of this

696
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,100
particular generational layer

697
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,700
typical however also for British

698
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,159
cultural studies at that point in time

699
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,039
is a certain gender blindness if you

700
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,659
look at let's say the early cultural

701
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,059
studies tradition uh those that did

702
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,740
research on subcultures by and large

703
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,900
looked at new sculptures as you could

704
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,799
say boyish masculine use cultures yeah

705
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,000
so there's certainly a certain gender

706
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,460
blindness in the kind of resistant youth

707
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,080
cultural literature

708
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,940
however this has increasingly been

709
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,039
addressed in subsequent work partially

710
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,440
this kind of Club cultures literature

711
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,360
that I mentioned also by the work of

712
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,279
artists such as Angela mcrobbie who was

713
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,720
part of the early British cultural

714
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,580
studies tradition is now a professor at

715
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,000
the goldsmiths college and it was really

716
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,500
addressed this kind of literature this

717
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,080
kind of gender dimension of uh of

718
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,860
cultural studies

719
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,720
another order and this is certainly a

720
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,279
book I can well the other book also but

721
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,380
I can certainly um recommend you to read

722
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,179
this book if only because it's a very

723
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,100
pleasant read it's beautifully written

724
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,140
and it's not a thick book I think it has

725
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,299
around 200 Pages Max I think it's pretty

726
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,500
uh pretty readable

727
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,299
uh and his and then he's written many

728
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,799
things on everyday life but this is

729
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,659
perhaps the most heavily cited book the

730
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,200
practice of everyday life from 1984 the

731
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,820
having said the term that the English

732
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,760
translations from 1984 if I'm not

733
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,440
mistaken it might be later that the

734
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,299
original French day is actually from

735
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,279
that time I I will need to look it up I

736
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,120
forgot

737
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,279
is beautifully written it's perhaps more

738
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,620
poetic I would say and less political

739
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,080
than British cultural studies or at

740
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,020
least Less in your face political uh but

741
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,140
it has a vocabulary I think that is um

742
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,020
uh has been very influential

743
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,080
um according to the Sato where Society

744
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,120
is is largely shaped and I think the by

745
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,100
the binary nature of it the way he

746
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,779
phrase it has been has been criticized

747
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,120
but still the the

748
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,039
um it has been very influential but

749
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,620
according to this the society's largely

750
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,320
shaped by tactics versus strategies or

751
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,059
strategies versus tactics in that order

752
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,059
perhaps with a kind of states

753
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,400
by and large he's French right so to see

754
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,960
who puts the states very Central perhaps

755
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,120
even more so than the economy

756
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,860
um devises all kinds of let's say

757
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,960
strategies structures orders of social

758
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,159
life against which uh we as Citizens as

759
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,679
as groups although it has a relatively

760
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,080
individual Focus device all kinds of

761
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,860
tactics in order to resist to to avoid

762
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,020
to intervene

763
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,419
um so all kinds of creative ways of of

764
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,640
dealing with dealing with strategies and

765
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,320
sort of turning it around and doing

766
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,600
something else with it this is the kind

767
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,880
of literature right that which as I said

768
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,860
the binary nature of it that this idea

769
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,419
that there is such a thing as strategies

770
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,700
let's say top-down strategies versus

771
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,500
bottom-up tactics because that's the

772
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,659
kind of image you see is problematic

773
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,059
it's too simplistic I think but it has

774
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,340
very much shaped this idea that we have

775
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,080
let's say uh media cultures shaping uh

776
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,299
shaping things but we are also creative

777
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,220
consumers we can actually change and

778
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,880
creatively interpret things yeah

779
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,279
gives a very Urban angle to this it

780
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,020
really talks a lot about let's say

781
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,419
walking in the city for example some of

782
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,760
the walking literature and walking

783
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,200
um there's a door is one of the key

784
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,880
artists there and it really looks at

785
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,500
okay obviously there's a city which has

786
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,940
been designed and structured and

787
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,220
constructed in a certain way but we as

788
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,440
soon as we can walk in the city and sort

789
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,500
of adapt and use a different line route

790
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,020
of walking Etc and in ways not intended

791
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,820
by the designers

792
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,380
so it doesn't lead to a kind of

793
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,299
literature any kind of reading reading

794
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:47,460
which looks at tactics everyday

795
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,380
practices I would say the practice of

796
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,960
everyday life as situated it's often

797
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,960
very local sometimes as defensive in in

798
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,620
defense uh yeah in defense too but also

799
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,600
sometimes opportunistic you sort of pick

800
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,520
up on some structured elements and do

801
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,620
something else with it so that's the

802
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,120
kind of literature and especially kind

803
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,700
of vocabulary which again has shaped a

804
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,760
lot of things this idea of of of

805
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,440
achieved a lot of research uh on on

806
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,159
Urban sorry on everyday life

807
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,919
okay

808
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,380
that's my first part I will I'm just

809
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,760
going to quick look but I see no one

810
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,200
entering anymore because now I have

811
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
pretty much all

812
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,700
chat box not a box is open

813
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,980
um are there any questions on this first

814
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,380
part as a kind of

815
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,260
uh first corner I see a question from

816
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,980
Vera as James Scott can you maybe

817
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,419
explain this very critical brief

818
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,659
question

819
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,700
I don't see you so you're gonna have to

820
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,460
sort of speak up now I was just thinking

821
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,740
about the the work of uh the the circle

822
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Michelle that you mentioned yeah and

823
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,779
actually also James Carter is from the

824
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,600
the same period he published the the

825
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,419
everyday life experience of the pleasant

826
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,820
Etc yeah and he spoke about this uh

827
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,059
infrapolitics and Mathis stuff

828
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,380
absolutely no it's it's very much part

829
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,960
of the state the same reasoning so one

830
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,100
of the other books that I could have

831
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,600
mentioned deep raps but it has been less

832
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,600
influential in in urban studies but

833
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,880
there's a great book by by James Scott

834
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
also seeing like a state

835
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,620
which is basically this this kind of

836
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,840
logic it's the kind of see like States

837
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,600
you could replace that with the with the

838
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,140
dosato vocabulary of strategies and then

839
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,020
you have citizens people communities

840
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,580
these profitable community oriented

841
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,679
they're partially shaped I think by his

842
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,899
anthropological backgrounds which is

843
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,059
which devise all kinds of tactics as

844
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,740
ways of resistance no absolutely it's

845
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,380
it's that kind of that kind of debate

846
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,620
yeah good question

847
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,899
any other questions on this first point

848
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,539
if so just speak up because that's easy

849
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:02,100
for me than go through the whole list of

850
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,820
people

851
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,220
no

852
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,140
okay

853
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,179
then I'll continue with the second Parts

854
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,700
well yeah indeed

855
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,640
so a couple of lines of research that

856
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,860
are let's say more contemporary so

857
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,539
current lines of research within Urban

858
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:24,480
studies that focus on Urban culture

859
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,640
with an interdisciplinary over studies I

860
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,440
think here we definitely move beyond the

861
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,059
realm of urban geography narrowly

862
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,940
defined and I want to discuss with you

863
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,100
today

864
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,820
um

865
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,799
the reason why I spend a fair amount of

866
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,360
attention to the previous argument to

867
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,980
the previous debate is also because as

868
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,019
you will see in the discussion that now

869
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,179
follows is that the kind of vocabulary

870
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,159
that these kinds of debates use are very

871
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,559
still influenced knowingly or

872
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,260
unknowingly unknowingly so by the

873
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,080
previous discussions so by both issues

874
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,820
on the symbolic economy postmodern

875
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,399
urbanism informality in everyday life so

876
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,500
that really still shapes I think some of

877
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,419
these current debates

878
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,460
I will now discuss all possible

879
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,040
directions uh in in interdisciplinary

880
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,560
over studies on Urban culture if only

881
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,379
because culture is such a let's say

882
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,960
a slippery concept and and research has

883
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,399
to really explode in all kinds of

884
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,379
directions and as led to all kinds we

885
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,320
could say sub-disciplines uh or or let's

886
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,599
say certain strands of research that

887
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,480
that would be impossible to do uh in uh

888
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,659
in a two-hour uh lecture so I've been

889
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,300
quite let's say uh selective the

890
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,859
selection has been purely based on my

891
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,839
own preferences in a sense that I'm

892
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,580
going to discuss with you the number of

893
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,440
strands of research that I consider to

894
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,940
be interesting or the most interesting

895
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,399
strands of research obviously I also

896
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,080
consider to be this the more to be the

897
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,179
more productive strands of research and

898
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,280
a lot of research is being done in this

899
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,560
uh in this kind of field

900
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,300
the first round of research I want to

901
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,339
discuss with you and again I'll pause at

902
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,980
the end of this trend is around the Arts

903
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,680
activism and urban engagement

904
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,760
um

905
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,619
research on the Arts of course there is

906
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,000
an established tradition obviously

907
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,700
primarily in the humanities of aesthetic

908
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,760
analysis of the Arts yeah so of painting

909
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,880
of music of theater mostly actually as

910
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,099
an increasingly so diverse uh

911
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,560
differentiating into different

912
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,780
disciplines so we'll have musicology you

913
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,220
will have tiered studies you will have

914
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,820
let's see art history or visual studies

915
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,140
and those are established editions

916
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,000
afterwards histories reaching back 100

917
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,700
years yeah

918
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,680
Urban studies and even as an

919
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,359
interdisciplinary field Builds on these

920
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,240
Traditions but actually it's primarily

921
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,760
uses a sociological and or political

922
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,440
economic approach towards the arts and

923
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,599
culture so some of the elements I will

924
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,400
discuss here they certainly do not

925
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,200
capture the diversity offer let's say

926
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,760
research on the Arts that is out there

927
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,940
yeah but um they do pretty much capture

928
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,980
I think what's out there within within

929
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,339
nervous studies

930
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:01,079
social scientific approach towards the

931
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,000
Arts obviously shapes the kinds of

932
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,300
questions being asked so one the result

933
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,060
of this is that we also see through the

934
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,560
let's say the critical focus on let's

935
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,140
say the political economy of the Arts we

936
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,560
also see it about in many or with many

937
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,960
orders and many in many Publications and

938
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
interest in the political or critical

939
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,820
potential and practice of the Arts yeah

940
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,760
this is partially also a response to

941
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,140
um and that's something I will not

942
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,660
discuss in detail here to a relatively

943
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,160
dominant debate on the creative and

944
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,960
cultural Industries which has really

945
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,079
shaped I think the debate on the Arts uh

946
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,599
in the last 20 years this idea that

947
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,800
creative and cultural Industries

948
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,200
contribute to to let's see our

949
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,119
contemporary knowledge economy that

950
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,280
there are key economic sectors in in our

951
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,619
in our current cities and thus with a

952
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:51,420
strong focus on economic dimensions of

953
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,380
culture

954
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,000
is interesting you could say the

955
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,560
political potential uh the critical

956
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,420
potential of the Arts is also partially

957
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,520
irresponsiveness there are longer

958
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,900
Traditions I will discuss some of them

959
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,119
but this is a way of also trying to look

960
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,740
at the creative Industries debate

961
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,599
critically and say okay well actually we

962
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,880
miss out on a lot when we do not address

963
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,040
the let's say the the resistant

964
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,780
dimensions of the Arts

965
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,040
now that dream well there are many of

966
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,900
course but I'm summarize them here as as

967
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,760
three main lines of urban research on

968
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,220
the Arts and I will discuss them uh

969
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,280
briefly in turn one and perhaps the most

970
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,800
established line of research uh also

971
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,320
because it ties in I think with a with a

972
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,680
history of research in the

973
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,440
uh well in in in our Theory basically in

974
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,599
an art history is research on public

975
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,020
arts and or site-specific Arts the terms

976
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,220
overlap

977
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,440
a second line of research is research on

978
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,599
artists and urban social movements the

979
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,640
relation between artistic practice and

980
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,260
urban social movements and of course

981
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,359
with social movements we can establish

982
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:57,119
debate within Urban studies also

983
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,220
and the third literature is literature

984
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,420
that is perhaps the most cultural

985
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,220
studies oriented literature is

986
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,440
literature on popular culture and urban

987
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,780
politics so it's literature that that's

988
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,240
increasingly

989
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,640
um I say engaged with with let's see

990
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,900
also theoretical and philosophical

991
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,599
literature on the political uh and how

992
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,820
public culture plays a role in relation

993
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,820
to Urban political questions

994
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,400
and I will discuss of course what I mean

995
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,720
with the political here because it's not

996
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,940
institutional politics per se or if at

997
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,099
all

998
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,099
now the first line of research within uh

999
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,599
within this this section

1000
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,180
as public art or site-specific art

1001
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,760
um for your readings I I added an

1002
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,339
admittedly relatively long uh chapter uh

1003
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,040
by Rosalind Deutsche a New York theorist

1004
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,780
so apologies for the length of the of

1005
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,720
the chapter but I I included it because

1006
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,480
it's well for two reasons one goes in

1007
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,520
Deutsche is a key art theorist a key

1008
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,579
cultural theorist who very early on I

1009
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,640
think understood the the productive

1010
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,099
connections between our Theory and urban

1011
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,800
studies or geography critical geography

1012
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,920
yeah and who wrote in the 1980s and

1013
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,640
1990s a few foundational papers on uh on

1014
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,200
the Arts and the urban

1015
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,359
the the paper here is called uneven

1016
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:21,020
development public art in New York City

1017
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,220
and it basically covers how you could

1018
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,460
say a history of dealing with or

1019
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,680
engaging with public art in New York

1020
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,000
City

1021
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,400
um both by let's say local governments

1022
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,619
local the real estate developers more or

1023
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:37,140
less in Project developers and uh and

1024
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,140
artistic communities

1025
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,000
I could have chosen other articles there

1026
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,040
are many other articles possible

1027
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,780
um in the same book by the way and I

1028
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,880
think I included the full book there's

1029
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,660
also a great uh critique the feminist

1030
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,900
critique of uh of Jameson and Harvey by

1031
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,880
the way I think the the the chapters

1032
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,800
called men in space if I'm not mistaken

1033
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,320
so basically she devises it develops a

1034
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,540
feminist ethnographic critique of

1035
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,040
Jameson and Harvey so I could definitely

1036
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,619
advise you to read this also

1037
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,079
um but in this particular paper she

1038
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,460
basically

1039
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,020
develops a critique of the

1040
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,420
instrumentalization of public art so an

1041
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,800
emotion of the public by local

1042
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,780
governments and developers so this idea

1043
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,900
that public Arts the way is presented or

1044
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,579
used by local governments and developers

1045
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,200
let's say for those working more on

1046
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,300
planning in many countries you will have

1047
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,400
if you have a kind of building scheme or

1048
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,859
a local local planning project a certain

1049
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:33,300
percentage of the budget needs to be

1050
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,000
spent on public art now for those who

1051
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,180
know this in most cases this rarely

1052
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,760
leads in many cases in most cases this

1053
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,380
does not lead to very interesting types

1054
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,420
of art it's a kind of tick to box

1055
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,760
exercise in some cases of course it does

1056
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,859
so she develops the kind of critique of

1057
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:53,280
how public art is instrumentalized in

1058
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,560
order to further you could say the

1059
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,900
uneven development of New York City so

1060
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,320
it kind of shaped by Elite concerns and

1061
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,820
shape of political political economic

1062
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,560
concerns

1063
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,780
so public garden becomes a kind of

1064
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,400
legitimation device for uneven

1065
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,800
development uneven development

1066
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,960
the issue briefly refers and I mentioned

1067
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,700
here because I like the term to the term

1068
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,579
pseudo pseudo public sphere which is a

1069
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,140
critique of Alexander klug and another

1070
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,720
theorist on the sort of this idea of

1071
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,119
Harvard Martian kind of Ideal public

1072
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,700
sphere as a field of deliberation where

1073
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,900
he says well actually there's very

1074
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,380
little actual dialogue taking place but

1075
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,880
she also hints that and this is

1076
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,859
something that for example Nancy Fraser

1077
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,839
and other theorists later data also

1078
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:39,180
developed in more detail perhaps to this

1079
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,099
idea of the emerges oppositional public

1080
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,440
spheres yes there is uneven development

1081
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,780
but it kind of pseudo public sphere but

1082
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,520
we also see kind of oppositional public

1083
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,859
spheres emerging public spheres which

1084
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,020
which on top of that have a heavy

1085
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,640
emphasis on let's say cultural and

1086
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,520
aesthetic Dimensions so basically often

1087
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,260
artistic communities are related to

1088
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,260
actors being engaged in the design of

1089
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,660
oppositional public spheres and again of

1090
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,800
course this especially for those

1091
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,200
interested in the Arts has been of

1092
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,760
massive influence and thinking to what

1093
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,579
kind of role can the Arts play in in the

1094
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,320
urban and in urban development at Large

1095
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,720
now here's a nice quote Thing by

1096
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,640
Deutsche that summarizes like uh

1097
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,380
basically this this kind of idea and the

1098
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,720
critique also so the idea that art

1099
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,880
cannot assume the existence of a public

1100
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,180
what must help produce one and that the

1101
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,980
public sphere is less a physical space

1102
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,880
than a social nullify to a considerable

1103
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,099
considerable extent accepted divisions

1104
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,800
between public and non-public art

1105
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,480
potentially any exhibition venue is a

1106
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,460
public sphere and conversely the

1107
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,619
location of artworks outside privately

1108
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,500
owned galleries in parks and plazas or

1109
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,599
simply Outdoors hardly guarantees that

1110
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,220
you will address the public

1111
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,200
now I'm sure that the the this quote

1112
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,960
perhaps needs a bit of unpacking right

1113
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,520
um but basically what she's trying to

1114
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,339
get at here is in the first sentence is

1115
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,079
that we cannot assume that by simply

1116
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,960
let's say putting public art on a Public

1117
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,839
Square for example we cannot assume that

1118
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,119
we automatically address the public yeah

1119
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,220
people just don't mind not engage with

1120
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,040
it uh people just that might just be

1121
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,500
there but but that doesn't really make

1122
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,079
it public right we can only make it

1123
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,060
public if it actually is actively engage

1124
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,460
with people so you actually you actually

1125
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,800
have to construct a public and this is

1126
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,420
more than what most public Arts

1127
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,440
supposedly public art achieves yeah

1128
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,960
at this so this this is the first

1129
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,339
question the question you're the first

1130
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,800
critique she has the second line is okay

1131
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,079
we we this actually leads If You Think

1132
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,760
Through The Logical conclusions of this

1133
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,140
it means that

1134
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,940
it uh simply by putting uh arts in the

1135
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,339
out in the open doesn't make public art

1136
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,960
but it also means that for example we

1137
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,200
can have public arts in a gallery yeah

1138
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,240
as long as you engage with the public

1139
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,980
this obviously would constitute public

1140
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,319
art so she critiques this distinction

1141
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,960
within much of our theory of that time

1142
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,740
uh that that relied on this idea that uh

1143
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,780
a critique of let's say Modern Art is

1144
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,760
that you move out of move out of the

1145
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,680
gallery and into the public she says

1146
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,780
well actually yes that's a good idea but

1147
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,220
it doesn't really make for public art

1148
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,300
per se

1149
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,520
so this is basically the kind of let's

1150
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,800
say dichotomy she's playing with and

1151
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,040
that are important I think to uh to um

1152
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,800
well to keep in mind

1153
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,440
short summary most important thing to

1154
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,300
keep in mind is that that we have an art

1155
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,599
object but this art object needs actual

1156
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,400
engagement with an audience with the

1157
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,099
public in order to become public yeah

1158
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,200
that's that's important to keep in mind

1159
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,440
here

1160
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,520
to make it a bit more uh concrete she

1161
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,540
she has one very famous example

1162
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,619
um by an equally famous artist although

1163
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,300
not not at the time I think he was still

1164
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,040
relatively let's say young in his career

1165
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,900
at that point in time

1166
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,180
um which is Richard Sarah's tilted Arc

1167
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,040
this example is also discussed in the in

1168
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,359
the paper by

1169
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:15,540
um uh by uh by Deutsche

1170
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,700
now as you can see on the on the image

1171
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,480
here

1172
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,119
this is quite obviously an intervention

1173
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,000
in public space right it's a massive

1174
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,339
piece of work it's a 37 meter long and

1175
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,579
3.7 meter tall steel plate on Foley

1176
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,640
Square which is uh in lower Manhattan

1177
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,319
New York yeah

1178
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,780
so if anything this this is this is a

1179
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,579
kind of public artwork that you cannot

1180
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,520
ignore obviously

1181
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,560
now the way sort of this

1182
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,599
um according to Deutsche the way sort of

1183
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,500
this

1184
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,040
um uh this artwork has been sort of uh

1185
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,599
um let's say interpreted or let's say

1186
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,640
received and it really shows some of the

1187
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,680
problems of of public art as she she

1188
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,480
made as she sees it

1189
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,800
um some of you could say some of the

1190
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,079
more conservative voices or sort of use

1191
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,180
of the public space heavily criticize

1192
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,880
this this piece of piece of art because

1193
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,220
it basically it blocks their way of

1194
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,020
Passage obviously right if you look at

1195
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,500
the image uh it it it completely makes

1196
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,900
impossible the usage of of the of the

1197
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,859
Public Square by um by uh let's say

1198
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,720
workers working moving from one building

1199
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,140
to the next yeah at the same time uh

1200
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,520
Deutsche argues well this doesn't

1201
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,500
necessarily make it public arts and some

1202
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,240
of the exaggerated claims made by

1203
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,240
critical let's say Defenders of of this

1204
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,339
piece of work uh they have really

1205
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,440
focused you could say on assumptions as

1206
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,680
the shifts in behavior of disposed uses

1207
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,599
of this space so without actually

1208
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,460
talking to people without actually

1209
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,380
engaging with their own interests they

1210
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,359
have assumed that the very fact that

1211
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,040
people had to sort of re-articulate

1212
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,560
their let's say everyday practices that

1213
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,480
that led to a more aesthetic engagement

1214
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,760
with the public space

1215
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,380
now according to Deutsche the main

1216
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,980
problem of the the discourse around this

1217
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,260
this piece of art as well as the piece

1218
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,720
of art itself is that it relied on a

1219
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,000
very narrow aesthetic reading so

1220
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,640
ignoring actual uses of urban space to

1221
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,040
very generic claims on ecstatic uses of

1222
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,680
the square yeah so actually it's a kind

1223
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,160
of public art Intervention which refuses

1224
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,079
to be public because it doesn't engage

1225
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,300
in any sense with the public so this

1226
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,220
idea that the public involves a dialogue

1227
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,319
is completely ignored in this sense it's

1228
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,220
basically and ultimately a strong artist

1229
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,940
figure putting an art piece in a Public

1230
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,980
Square without actually becoming part

1231
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,260
and engaging with the public now this

1232
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,300
piece was also removed in 1989 after

1233
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,060
years of of critique but that's perhaps

1234
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,900
a side note for the debate here

1235
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,240
the counter example uh perhaps

1236
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,859
oppositional public sphere You could

1237
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:54,720
argue that that Deutsche uses and I

1238
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,599
think this is a an artwork that that has

1239
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,099
also been picked up by artists such as

1240
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:01,319
Neil Smith who also wrote a piece on

1241
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:02,400
this

1242
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,079
um it's just of what just caused the

1243
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,900
homeless vehicle project also a public

1244
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,060
art space but a different kind of animal

1245
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,640
so here in this case the vehicle decided

1246
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,380
that I had a lab by the way when looking

1247
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,640
at this picture because I'm pretty sure

1248
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,619
it is the Trump Tower in the back but

1249
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:18,100
that's something else

1250
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,819
[Music]

1251
00:48:19,819 --> 00:48:22,380
which at that point in time had less of

1252
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,480
a less of symbolic value perhaps in it

1253
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,339
than it has now

1254
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:27,720
um that's a different kind of animal

1255
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,540
it's also public art

1256
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,180
um also metal in many ways but here it's

1257
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,220
a vehicle designed by artists by the

1258
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,960
artist sorry and singular in

1259
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,420
consultation with homeless people and it

1260
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,920
was seen in a different way it was seen

1261
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,260
as a practical tool for managing

1262
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,780
everyday life of the homeless so in this

1263
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,400
thing which you can let's say expand

1264
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,540
when uh once when when when uh placed

1265
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,300
somewhere uh it was a space for washing

1266
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,099
for sleeping but also for storage space

1267
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,260
for example for collecting empty bottles

1268
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,700
or something

1269
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,180
um so all this in into one one vehicle

1270
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,099
vehicle sorry

1271
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,500
this was both an exhibition object which

1272
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,420
was exhibited in you could say classic

1273
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,760
galleries as well as an objects for

1274
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,800
actually making visible the homeless in

1275
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,119
public space

1276
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,160
so it's it I think on the base of this

1277
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,020
example you already feel a bit to kind

1278
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,780
of did let's say different approach uh

1279
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,200
used uh towards the public by this this

1280
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,119
piece of work or by the previous piece

1281
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,460
by by Richard Sarah because here there

1282
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,200
is an engagement with specific Urban

1283
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,260
users highly marginalized you use on top

1284
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,140
of this uh and thus implicitly or

1285
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,060
explicitly a critique of uneven Urban

1286
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,099
developments because it's a piece of

1287
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:43,619
work that is situated in public space

1288
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,540
and makes visible you could say the

1289
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,680
effects of on the Urban Development on a

1290
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,400
wider group of let's say Urban users

1291
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:02,000
see whoops all right to my screens here

1292
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,480
okay maybe to wrap up here on this on

1293
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,599
this first strand of of research so

1294
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,339
these are all examples of site-specific

1295
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,740
art that that that moved art beyond the

1296
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,140
exhibition space into the urban so there

1297
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,940
was a thing within our Theory and art

1298
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,859
and art history kind of internal

1299
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,900
critique of the art worlds we have to

1300
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,880
move out of the museums out of the

1301
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,640
galleries but also a broadening or and

1302
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,280
and sort of as a result of that also a

1303
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,079
broadening of aesthetic debates to wider

1304
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:32,700
social concerns

1305
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,760
so this then leads to to Notions such as

1306
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,800
going by critically in this case by by

1307
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,660
Health Foster such as the Artist as a

1308
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,579
sonographer which looks at the role of

1309
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:43,560
the artist in the collaborative process

1310
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,660
or the or the Artist as a participant

1311
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,160
Observer so the artist has an

1312
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,780
ethnographer

1313
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,599
um so a critique of foster is also I

1314
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,099
think this has been picked up in in

1315
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:54,960
later work also is that the

1316
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,880
globalization of our market and this is

1317
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,260
where let's say different disciplinary

1318
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,599
debates also become interesting that the

1319
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,579
globalization of the Art Market this is

1320
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:04,200
something rarely addressed sufficiently

1321
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,180
I think in urban studies leads for

1322
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,800
example to commissioning of artists to

1323
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,500
produce a community-based site-specific

1324
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,720
artworks however without the clear

1325
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,240
knowledge of the local context so we see

1326
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,280
let's say the bayonet by and biannual

1327
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,319
Logic for example the Art Festival logic

1328
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,380
where artists are are flown into

1329
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,640
particular sites in order to develop

1330
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,619
community-based work but they rarely

1331
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,079
know the community so often these are uh

1332
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,380
let's say only superficially speaking uh

1333
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,240
Public Works uh of works of public Arts

1334
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,640
and again so much of this was

1335
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,079
foreshadowed a thing by the work of

1336
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,760
Deutsche also but of course also others

1337
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,040
at this point in time

1338
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,460
okay

1339
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,940
so that's the first strand of research

1340
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,920
a second strand of research is around

1341
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,900
Artisans Urban social movements and of

1342
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,859
course I'm making analytical

1343
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:57,480
distinctions here in practice some of

1344
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,099
these debates overlap and there are

1345
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,260
interactions but for the purpose of

1346
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,640
discussion I think it's helpful to keep

1347
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,500
them a bit separate

1348
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,359
so the second strand of research tries

1349
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:07,859
to look at artists and Earth social

1350
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:09,540
movements so there's a long-standing

1351
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,980
tradition obviously

1352
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,920
of artists engaging in social movements

1353
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,020
but mostly those have been researched I

1354
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,780
would argue outside of urban studies

1355
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:20,760
again within let's say the the the the

1356
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,400
the field specific debates such as

1357
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,099
theater or such as as our visual studies

1358
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:27,960
Etc or art history

1359
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,440
within our studies I think uh most of

1360
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,319
the recent debates in this area has been

1361
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,940
on the critique of the creative class

1362
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,800
and creative Industries policies has

1363
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,260
already hinted that or perhaps

1364
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,480
neoliberal or entrepreneurial urbanism

1365
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,760
more widely so what kind of role do

1366
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,180
artists play in or part of urban social

1367
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,700
movements and critiquing you could say

1368
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,880
the neo-liberalization of of the urban

1369
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,140
now it is a nice paper actually by

1370
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,900
Johannes Novi and Claire colon who many

1371
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,720
of you have seen attended today who

1372
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,280
wrote a nice paper on struggling for the

1373
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,020
right to the creative City in Berlin and

1374
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,980
Hamburg and where they give a nice brief

1375
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,079
brief but nice overview I think of urban

1376
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:16,020
social movements uh so it's a kind of

1377
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,839
literature which I'd well we don't

1378
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:20,339
really discuss a thing in our social

1379
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:22,140
geography that's an important literature

1380
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,240
which moves from the history of

1381
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,520
squatting and demonstrations against a

1382
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,800
renewal uh politics to Urban Counter

1383
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,240
Culture

1384
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,339
um and then zoom in on the role of

1385
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:33,720
artists and cultural workers in

1386
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,300
contesting uh called creative class and

1387
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,520
creative Industries politics now there's

1388
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,020
a lot that can be said about this but

1389
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,400
what is interesting here of course is

1390
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,140
that automatically the debate becomes

1391
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,760
you could say sociological or social

1392
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,040
scientific because the moment you start

1393
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,359
looking at artists within social

1394
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,099
movements you can no longer look just at

1395
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,079
their aesthetic Expressions but you

1396
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,579
automatically have to look at what is

1397
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:55,920
practically speaking their role with an

1398
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,319
often quite heterogeneous diverse

1399
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,900
composition of protest movements so we

1400
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,700
see artists collaborating with diverse

1401
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,099
set of actors and that of course shapes

1402
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,619
their artistic practice

1403
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,359
the role of artists here at least this

1404
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,520
is what no vehicle highlights uh

1405
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,380
highlights strongly I think they they

1406
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,720
are definitely on to something there is

1407
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,579
that artists and to some extent have a

1408
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,319
privileged role or a particular role

1409
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:21,420
within Urban social movements because

1410
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,400
they have access to an experience with

1411
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,740
media networks and a familiarity with

1412
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,140
communication techniques so this then

1413
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,880
leads to a discussion around the role of

1414
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,220
artists in in how let's say particular

1415
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,619
Urban conflicts are framed and reframed

1416
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:37,740
by artists in an often in visual or

1417
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,819
other ways

1418
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:43,200
now there are many examples you can

1419
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,640
discuss here this is one example

1420
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,040
discussed also in the in the article of

1421
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,220
the media protest in Berlin uh for those

1422
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,660
that know Berlin you will know probably

1423
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,280
also know sort of the history a bit of

1424
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,660
media I should be I will now discuss

1425
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,700
this here it's a big Urban Development

1426
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,140
uh area uh on let's say well the

1427
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,700
southern part of free design northern

1428
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,800
part of course pack

1429
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,520
um

1430
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,920
partially which really let's let the

1431
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,079
counter mobilization uh because this is

1432
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,000
also the area which is let's say you

1433
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,940
have a a concentration of artistic and

1434
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,420
and and Leisure and clubbing activity so

1435
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,000
here's a one

1436
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,800
simple example where sort of artists you

1437
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,839
could say have been involved in

1438
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:26,700
developing different let's say visual

1439
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,319
Aesthetics in a sense this basically

1440
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,420
ironically Builds on the B Berlin

1441
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,220
branding scheme so for those who don't

1442
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,500
know it just Google it and it uses the

1443
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,099
same kind of design but then changes the

1444
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:39,839
kind of language right and sort of

1445
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,359
ironically so instead of being hip being

1446
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:45,240
creative and being uh how to translate

1447
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,440
that if I can translate that being

1448
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,599
well used and thrown away so to speak

1449
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,359
modifiable yeah commodifiables perhaps

1450
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:55,920
the closest yeah thank you very very

1451
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,839
good point for real bus sounds better

1452
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,240
though but you're right commodifiable

1453
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,780
and they replace it by size

1454
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,700
so it could be self

1455
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,180
Again difficult to try itself uh

1456
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,359
um

1457
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,480
independent something along those lines

1458
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,760
solidarity solidarity uh and be

1459
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,579
resistance so stop gentrification so

1460
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,319
this is one example

1461
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,420
other examples of course not discussing

1462
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,760
this particular article but um

1463
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,319
uh from other

1464
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,260
um other sites of course this kind of

1465
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,119
artistic let's say framing of political

1466
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,640
and urban conflicts ties in with a much

1467
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,099
much longer history of Art and pro-step

1468
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,680
protest most obviously in street art as

1469
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,240
well as graphic design so there are a

1470
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,220
couple of examples that are let's say

1471
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,780
illustrative of this but certainly not

1472
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,180
exhaustive so on the top right you see a

1473
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,920
performance protest of an extension

1474
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,500
extension Extinction Rebellion uh

1475
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,960
protest in London uh do the middle left

1476
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,359
I think has been quite a similar visible

1477
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,119
to most if you would think black lives

1478
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:01,800
matter paint the street I think this one

1479
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,559
indeed Washington DC or to the bottom

1480
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,960
right

1481
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,859
a a

1482
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:10,200
claim State well if a painting stating

1483
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,260
the load to the debt repayments uh on

1484
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,480
Street Arts intervention in Buenos Aires

1485
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,819
yeah and I could have used many many

1486
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:20,280
other examples but just to give a sense

1487
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,440
of uh of the various sort of artists

1488
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,319
play a role in in urban social movements

1489
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,420
or at least early protests if it's less

1490
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,880
organized than than a social movement

1491
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,040
and again this has a much much longer

1492
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,700
history uh going back uh many many years

1493
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,559
some would argue since the emergence of

1494
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:40,140
industrialization in many ways

1495
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,319
about where are you

1496
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:45,839
so the last

1497
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,260
one yeah sorry

1498
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,119
so the last round within this section

1499
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,640
that I want to discuss with you

1500
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,500
um is popular cultural and urban

1501
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,240
politics

1502
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,040
um this is last you could say less

1503
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,079
around Urban social movement it also

1504
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:03,420
lasts around the art world as such but

1505
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,040
more about more broader cultural

1506
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,440
expressions so here we really go back to

1507
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,000
the classical core of cultural studies

1508
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,280
that I discussed before with you to use

1509
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,200
the focus on popular culture

1510
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,200
as in everyday life as questioning

1511
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,700
Authority but also as imagining

1512
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,700
political Alternatives so the kind of

1513
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,460
language that we then uh use or see use

1514
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,140
in this kind of research is that there's

1515
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,660
a it's about politics Beyond governments

1516
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,700
and politicians to work on the street

1517
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,339
Politics As I said about called it or

1518
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:34,200
also kind of informalization and this is

1519
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,119
where the informality the term pops up

1520
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:38,579
again as you see informalization of the

1521
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:41,460
State uh as for example Julian Boudreau

1522
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,400
has called it a nice nice book by the

1523
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,520
way

1524
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,960
again there are many many examples here

1525
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,740
to to to to to to to discuss the classic

1526
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,780
case I would argue in this in this field

1527
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,780
of research is hip-hop or rap rap music

1528
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,160
more narrowly

1529
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,079
which has been studied by now I think by

1530
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,940
multiple multiple disciplines range from

1531
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,040
musicology cultural studies anthropology

1532
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,260
but also Urban studies which

1533
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,240
traditionally has Focus I think strongly

1534
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,160
on account of classic cultural studies

1535
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,500
Community orientation Urban localities

1536
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,440
and so the hood the ghetto as classic

1537
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,440
Urban teams but which also I think in a

1538
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,599
more critical literature uh has paid

1539
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,059
attention to let's say the way rap

1540
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:26,339
hip-hop culture has become less they

1541
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:29,339
commodified in in its globalization of

1542
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:32,040
of of its cultural form yeah but also

1543
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,140
how it has been picked up by people from

1544
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,420
outside of let's say the us as as

1545
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,960
opposed to the source of of hip-hop

1546
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,359
culture so that's the classic case the

1547
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:44,099
library is full of books by now I think

1548
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:46,079
on hip-hop there's some more interesting

1549
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,240
than others this book by Murray Foreman

1550
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,059
is quite uh quite an interesting example

1551
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:51,960
though

1552
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,579
similar research has also been done in

1553
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:55,799
other genres uh typically a lot of

1554
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:57,599
attention has been paid to music we see

1555
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,160
it in other fields of activity also but

1556
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,480
music has received perhaps most

1557
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,640
attention in relation to popular culture

1558
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,839
and the political

1559
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,000
ranging from clubbing culture but also

1560
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,680
Opera a lot of political perhaps less

1561
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,500
obviously there to punk to Jazz to all

1562
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,780
kinds of other cultural expressions

1563
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:19,260
laughs

1564
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,020
now with all these strands um

1565
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,480
amount to is that they point to

1566
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,460
different aesthetic strategies to engage

1567
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,380
the urban yeah and this is something

1568
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:32,040
that uh well as as also increasingly

1569
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,799
received attention within Urban studies

1570
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,480
um in an article about team and bias I

1571
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,099
put a reference at the bottom of the

1572
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:39,960
slides it points to a number of

1573
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,380
different aesthetic strategies they as I

1574
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,819
said as a right here they are

1575
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:47,099
analytically distinct but in practice of

1576
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:48,299
course they are they can they are

1577
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,400
Messier it's some some let's say

1578
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,220
aesthetic practices might be uh involved

1579
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,619
in a number of things at the same time

1580
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,660
here we said okay we basically we have

1581
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,640
spectacle Grassroots Social Work

1582
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,680
arousing the census and you can

1583
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,420
automatically see a thing to have some

1584
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,700
of the examples I've I've shown before

1585
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,520
can be one or more of these things so

1586
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,440
let's say for example the black lives

1587
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,000
matter

1588
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,460
um let's say Banner on the street so to

1589
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,799
speak in a way you could argue this is

1590
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,020
Grassroots uh you could argue this is

1591
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,299
also social work you could argue with

1592
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,099
some some I would also arouses the

1593
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,200
senses because it's it's sometimes it

1594
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,780
questions the Norms of what these trees

1595
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,339
are for and questions different let's

1596
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:32,339
say media representations but quite

1597
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:34,500
obviously it's also spectacle because it

1598
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,500
has really sort of traveled widely and

1599
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,880
can easily be used any kind of

1600
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,339
commodification strategy almost of

1601
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:43,559
branding almost particular cities yeah

1602
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:45,119
so there are all kinds of different

1603
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,980
dimensions and it's it's an empirical

1604
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,260
question ultimately to look at concrete

1605
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,599
artistic practices to look at what the

1606
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,339
different dimensions uh let's say their

1607
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:57,180
relation to each other is

1608
01:01:57,319 --> 01:02:01,440
okay that's a long stretch for one uh

1609
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,599
one slide but it might also be one of

1610
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,480
the longer uh longer discussions

1611
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,359
uh I'll take a short break here four

1612
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,640
questions so please

1613
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,440
um just either type them in the chat or

1614
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,559
just start unmuting and speaking if if

1615
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:17,940
there are any questions on this section

1616
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,740
it gives me a chance to drink a bit of

1617
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,859
water

1618
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,880
wow that was a pre-prepared question

1619
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,400
that was a fast or unless you type very

1620
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,299
fast

1621
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:33,660
so already can answer the question uh or

1622
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,220
or a point I want to raise attention to

1623
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,440
your related phenomenon where an

1624
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,180
artistic creative approach

1625
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,599
is used in part uh of a broader

1626
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:44,280
participatory and Redevelopment strategy

1627
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,380
here's some sort of institutionalizing

1628
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,000
of arts and their movements is happening

1629
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,280
as small quirky teams of Architects

1630
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,780
planners activists and artists are

1631
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,640
leading the process and through an

1632
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,819
example and then there's a website maybe

1633
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:59,520
you can so if if I understand you

1634
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,079
correctly we won't look at the example

1635
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:02,640
now

1636
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,579
then it's your point being that artists

1637
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:07,980
can actually be become Urban developers

1638
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,460
themselves

1639
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,359
will be good

1640
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:17,099
I don't see you so you have to I have to

1641
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,660
unmute the weekend now I see you but

1642
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,180
you're immunity all right sorry

1643
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,000
um yeah uh exactly like artists are

1644
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,720
becoming part of the planning process or

1645
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,819
more I think that the

1646
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:34,740
um I think the low threshold uh approach

1647
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,140
of like artistic experimental like

1648
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,880
creativeness

1649
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,420
as being employed in order to like

1650
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,900
justify maybe participatory processes or

1651
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,420
lead to a more like inclusion of people

1652
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:52,020
or like let them participate participate

1653
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,839
in the first place but also just to uh

1654
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:57,780
get uh the people on board and create

1655
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,720
some sort of tolerance so they this one

1656
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,720
would be like the creative what is it

1657
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,299
called the Festival of creative Urban

1658
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:09,480
living in Milton Keynes

1659
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,220
um the UK England uh so yeah it's like

1660
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,160
uh it sounds like coming from a very

1661
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,160
like dry urban planning background this

1662
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,520
is like a weird thing to do because

1663
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,500
people who are attending this they're

1664
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,540
usually not aware of the broader scope

1665
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,280
of this whole development that's

1666
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,079
happening to them

1667
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,960
um so that's just interesting to to also

1668
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,940
take absolutely it's a good addition

1669
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,380
something that I don't explicitly

1670
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,240
mention here but it's a it's a

1671
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,160
relatively new trend I think certainly

1672
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,960
something that we see more and more of

1673
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,059
the last I mean it was there before but

1674
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:46,619
it has become more visible I think in

1675
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:48,420
the last 10 years

1676
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,880
um I would still argue though that the

1677
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,680
same kind of critical vocabulary already

1678
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,599
introduced by Deutsche is also necessary

1679
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,640
for these projects because in some of

1680
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,020
these projects or initiatives at least

1681
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:01,079
we do see a relatively instrumental or

1682
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:04,200
instrumentalization of artists I.E not

1683
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,940
the one artist is not the other artists

1684
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,480
right so we see certain artists

1685
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,400
um standing up as entrepreneurs you

1686
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,500
could say and becoming project

1687
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,839
developers in relatively uncritical ways

1688
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,059
and I can name some examples also in

1689
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,299
Brussels where there's um where this is

1690
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:24,299
happening which actually leads to a fair

1691
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:27,359
amount of uh critique also within the

1692
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,339
artistic Community yeah and I wouldn't

1693
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:32,160
say uh that this is like necessarily

1694
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,140
like a bad or a good thing like the

1695
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,000
themes that are involved are like really

1696
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,599
good uh teams but it's just uh like

1697
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,460
always like look look very critical

1698
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,680
because also the urban governments try

1699
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,640
sometimes to use this strategy in a very

1700
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,680
deceiving way yeah okay excellent thank

1701
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,540
you I see another calendar or comment

1702
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,880
literally by Vera

1703
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,780
please unmute

1704
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,640
yeah but but you already write this

1705
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:03,480
critic from the what is her name yeah

1706
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,599
and he's also the critic from zurkin

1707
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,240
like did this tricky fact of the art to

1708
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,599
be also the vehicle of the

1709
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:15,839
gentrification and and stuff so uh

1710
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,940
it's always super tricky to speak about

1711
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,119
the art and it's potential in urban

1712
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,059
space let's say yeah absolutely so I'll

1713
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:25,740
give another example later on I think

1714
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,799
also which which is and the article I

1715
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:31,619
mentioned by uh sorry was uh I can't go

1716
01:06:31,619 --> 01:06:33,960
back I can't go back I buy Timon base

1717
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,640
also mentioned some of these

1718
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,099
ambivalences that are seemingly

1719
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:40,020
unavoidable so to speak there's no pure

1720
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:42,180
space in that sense okay excellent and

1721
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,780
then there's Max also has a comment

1722
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:49,140
yeah just to add on this point that uh

1723
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,880
urica raised and this theme of

1724
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,359
institutionalization and

1725
01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:56,819
instrumentalization of of Art and

1726
01:06:56,819 --> 01:06:59,700
artists I think Amsterdam is actually an

1727
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,740
interesting example because there is

1728
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,039
this Municipal policy which could be

1729
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,700
translated as the breeding ground policy

1730
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,380
whereby the city assigns certain

1731
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:14,579
buildings as available for workshops and

1732
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:15,799
for artists

1733
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:18,660
to work there and often it's also very

1734
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,119
related to

1735
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:21,839
um

1736
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,200
yeah strategy actually to gentrify a

1737
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,599
particular area I don't know whether

1738
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,359
there's any research done on this plus

1739
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,579
maybe you know uh yeah it has been

1740
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:34,020
definitely also by the Amsterdam

1741
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,280
colleagues who also have a strong Urban

1742
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,900
studies research Tradition at the

1743
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,339
University of Amsterdam but also others

1744
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:40,380
uh no no that has been critical research

1745
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,760
being done at the Netherlands is a

1746
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,079
particular case it's an interesting case

1747
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:45,480
in any case because it's it's very less

1748
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,099
the advanced and professional and it is

1749
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:49,619
instrumentalization of the Arts on the

1750
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:52,319
urban level and the brute plus and the

1751
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:56,160
breeding policy policy is yeah it's it's

1752
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,680
striking in the way it's sort of

1753
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,839
well use and test positive side effects

1754
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:03,539
also but the way it literally uses the

1755
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:06,000
Arts in in relatively classical Urban

1756
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,559
Development strategies that's that's

1757
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:10,140
that's definitely uh true yeah no the

1758
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,119
research has been done in that yeah

1759
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:13,799
okay excellent thank you for the

1760
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:16,020
comments they they really add some very

1761
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,479
important uh additional thoughts here

1762
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,399
other points

1763
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,219
if not I continue with the third part uh

1764
01:08:23,219 --> 01:08:26,540
of the presentation and that's the the

1765
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:29,640
another section or direction of research

1766
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,140
on the

1767
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,319
uh on the Arts well also on on culture

1768
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,198
uh and the urban this is what I would

1769
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,120
call or this this is basically my label

1770
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,380
but I think it's what I would call

1771
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,359
research on cultural infrastructures and

1772
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:44,279
informal urbanism so that's whether

1773
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:45,779
that's in the literature on your formula

1774
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:48,660
actually starts uh broadening to let's

1775
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,060
say a literature on on informal urbanism

1776
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,620
which might be a phrase that you've come

1777
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,479
across also a number of times

1778
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,880
and this overlaps the thing in recent

1779
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,319
years where increasing attention has

1780
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,399
been paid to let's see the

1781
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:00,899
infrastructural dimension of urban

1782
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:03,060
cultures some Scholars have already

1783
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,339
talked about an infrastructural turn I I

1784
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:07,439
dislike talking about terms because it's

1785
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,339
very

1786
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:10,380
claiming a new fashion and it helps to

1787
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,020
get cited more but uh yeah there's some

1788
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,299
all these things built on all on older

1789
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:17,640
interest also having said that there is

1790
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,080
obviously more and more attention being

1791
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,540
paid within Urban studies to let's see

1792
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,939
questions of infrastructure uh and not

1793
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:26,698
just narrowly defined but a very diverse

1794
01:09:26,698 --> 01:09:28,799
types of infrastructure as you will see

1795
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,719
now let's hear one example I think which

1796
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,698
is a good example of it discussed by the

1797
01:09:32,698 --> 01:09:34,319
team and base article that I mentioned

1798
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,880
before

1799
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,319
um which you discussed in this article

1800
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:39,238
is it is is the work of the

1801
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:42,120
chicago-based artist yester Gates as

1802
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,219
some of you might know him

1803
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:46,560
um where to the left you see a piece

1804
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,020
that you did for the documentary

1805
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,260
well not biannual but documentary five

1806
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:58,560
yearly uh Festival in Castle so the

1807
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,660
documentary 2013 which I think was in

1808
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,260 2012. if I'm correct uh 12 ballasts for

1809
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,540
eugenotes house which basically is a

1810
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,280
restoration of an empty building in

1811
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,800
castle using labor and materials from

1812
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,480
the south side of Chicago

1813
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,460
so it's an interesting case because it

1814
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,679
was a kind of rundown building in Castle

1815
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,320
and where he had let's say we had the

1816
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,760
thoughtiest against the artists had

1817
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,400
materials but also workers moved

1818
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,620
transported so to say from Chicago to

1819
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,380
Castle to actually renovate the building

1820
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,260
and to actually perform in the building

1821
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:31,980
Etc

1822
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:34,560
so here's space and let's say the

1823
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,179
infrastructure of this space really

1824
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:38,460
emerged as a kind of social space while

1825
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,140
at the same time directing attention to

1826
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:42,900
migrant labor and in the case of of the

1827
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,580
SD Gates that is work and the kind of

1828
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,679
the issues he engages with with black

1829
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:49,080
cultural expression in a very particular

1830
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,300
space in Castle so there's a very let's

1831
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,659
see concrete artistic intervention

1832
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:57,600
to the right you see let's say the

1833
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,580
in a way the reference project for for

1834
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,820
the castle uh the castle case which is

1835
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,580
the Dorchester project or projects in

1836
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,380
Chicago which is basically you can argue

1837
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,640
and it links back I think to the

1838
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,540
previous

1839
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:13,140
um uh uh well addition raised by by the

1840
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,900
week but perhaps in the last let's say

1841
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,260
uh uh planner mode but basically this is

1842
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,300
a kind of urban development project led

1843
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,159
by Siesta gates in the south side of

1844
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:26,280
Chicago where the gate started buying up

1845
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,500
abandoned property after the 2008

1846
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,900
financial crisis and has redeveloped

1847
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,640
these buildings with local communities

1848
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,580
with other artists uh often creating a

1849
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,640
mixed of outer spaces of community

1850
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,460
spaces of let's say local restaurants or

1851
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,440
in this particular case also a library

1852
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,159
and and archive uh so the the Dorchester

1853
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:49,140
project

1854
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,699
now what's interesting here of course is

1855
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:52,199
that we we

1856
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:54,540
um we we are still in the realm of let's

1857
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,820
say issues around Urban culture but

1858
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,260
we've started paying more and more

1859
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,940
attention to okay where practically

1860
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,219
literally materially speaking are these

1861
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:04,380
are these located so this really leads

1862
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,820
them to the material infrastructure

1863
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,219
dimension of urban culture and some of

1864
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:10,260
what I consider to be some of the more

1865
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,179
interesting more productive line of

1866
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:14,460
research on Urban culture in the last

1867
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,440
years has really looked at these kind of

1868
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,120
infrastructural dimensions

1869
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,900
another pushing this a bit broader and

1870
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,699
perhaps also becoming less local and his

1871
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:32,159
orientation towards infrastructure

1872
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:36,239
is um a book that I that I added for the

1873
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,940
reading for today uh by Brian Larkin

1874
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,500
from 2008.

1875
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,260
signal and noise media infrastructure

1876
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,300
and urban culture in Nigeria

1877
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,000
which is for those that have rats I

1878
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,800
don't I don't expect you to have read

1879
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,659
the full book but maybe it may be the

1880
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,000
introduction at least

1881
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,620
which is an anthropological study on the

1882
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,020
cultural work of media Technologies

1883
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,420
this is the quote and their role in what

1884
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,400
in producing what we call Urban Africa

1885
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,699
focusing on Kano and a Muslim City in

1886
01:13:05,699 --> 01:13:07,020
Northern Islamic City and Northern

1887
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,520
Nigeria

1888
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,860
the Larkin book is interesting because

1889
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,600
it's just a very interesting book but

1890
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,300
also because he Flags a number of

1891
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,360
debates that that are let's say

1892
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,219
essential in research on infrastructures

1893
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:22,199
or in general or cultural

1894
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:23,880
infrastructures in particular

1895
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,640
one being it's not just about let's say

1896
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,460
pipes Etc and literally infrastructure

1897
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:31,800
but also a lot about the symbolic of

1898
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,300
representational logic of

1899
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,460
infrastructures so what do

1900
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,020
infrastructures mean how are they

1901
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,640
interpreted how are they envisioned how

1902
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,920
are they imagined this really receives a

1903
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,900
lot of attention I think in in most of

1904
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,060
the infrastructure research

1905
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,400
also in terms of governments to go to

1906
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,440
govern or control these infrastructures

1907
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,860
uh it gives examples of uh of this in

1908
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,840
the case of Nigeria

1909
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,000
um at the same time also the unexpected

1910
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,800
or unintended consequences of an

1911
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,080
infrastructural development governments

1912
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,520
for example or let's say our local

1913
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,640
developers can have a plan okay can have

1914
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,380
an idea as to why they want to develop a

1915
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,300
certain infrastructure but it doesn't

1916
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,920
necessarily mean that infrastructure is

1917
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,440
also used in this way so here we back a

1918
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,940
thing to perhaps to the older discussion

1919
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,980
around strategies and tactics but

1920
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,659
transpose to an infrastructural

1921
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:20,159
discussion

1922
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,600
and the other and the last element

1923
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,699
related to this of course is that around

1924
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:26,040
these infrastructures we see all kinds

1925
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,719
of informal social practices in everyday

1926
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:30,659
life emerging yeah which then are word

1927
01:14:30,659 --> 01:14:32,760
of attention but also worthy of of

1928
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,280
research so the example here I gave for

1929
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,780
example you can easily get very

1930
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,540
concretely imagine how around these

1931
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:42,719
spaces social practices emerge and are

1932
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,120
and are developed and they would perhaps

1933
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,340
not exist without these these

1934
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:48,659
infrastructures and that's the thing the

1935
01:14:48,659 --> 01:14:50,520
importance important to keep in mind

1936
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,199
here

1937
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:54,800
foreign

1938
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,880
for me the most interesting

1939
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,500
chapter in the book is perhaps the what

1940
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,820
is the last chapter if I remember

1941
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:06,140
correctly on on the role of piracy in in

1942
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,940
Nigeria so the examples he gives for

1943
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:12,300
example is is how Nigerian video

1944
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,719
and piracy a circus of distribution

1945
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,000
emerged in Nigeria uh and how this

1946
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,860
actually relates to a kind of what

1947
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,179
perhaps which goes called a full

1948
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:23,940
ecosystem of cultural but also obviously

1949
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:26,760
economic activity largely informal in

1950
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,340
the sense that it's barely regulated uh

1951
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:33,260
perhaps also uh illegal or

1952
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:35,520
illegitimate or something because it's

1953
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,620
uh often at that point in time when he

1954
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,020
did his research late 1990s early 2000s

1955
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:42,840
uh often copies illegal copies of

1956
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,420
Hollywood and Indian films but we're a

1957
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,280
bit at the same encano as a northern

1958
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,560
Nigeria City really emerging literally

1959
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,540
literally as a kind of Distribution Hub

1960
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,480
for The Wider African region yeah so

1961
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,460
with people on the right for example

1962
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,260
selling it on the street but also the

1963
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,820
same people or other people actually

1964
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,100
moving the the goods so to speak the

1965
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,840
material from one city to other cities

1966
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,780
often crossing boundaries

1967
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:09,360
now from the 1990s onwards I think we've

1968
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,760
seen an increase in production also and

1969
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,620
this is the the the argument developed

1970
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,260
by Larkin of Nigerian and especially

1971
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,960
hausa language videos leading to a quite

1972
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,820
organized system of how is that video

1973
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,580
Film Production but it building on the

1974
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,580
existing pirate infrastructure yeah so

1975
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,100
again a classic case of informal

1976
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:32,760
urbanism a very slippery or unclear

1977
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,860
distinction between where when is

1978
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,719
something still informal when does

1979
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,219
something become full because it has

1980
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:40,560
also become part to a certain extent of

1981
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,840
a formal registered economy with some

1982
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,659
businesses growing bigger and bigger but

1983
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:47,400
at the same time with for example how is

1984
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,600
the films aesthetically and

1985
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,120
organizationally still being shaped by

1986
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,520
you could say the older uh pirate

1987
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,280
Aesthetics and infrastructure yeah this

1988
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,800
is also the kind of a research which has

1989
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,360
received a lot of attention in recent

1990
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,460
years and which I have labeled here as

1991
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,320
being part of let's say research on

1992
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,179
cultural infrastructures and informal

1993
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:09,260
Urban them

1994
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,659
or to give another example a paper I

1995
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:17,940
wrote myself together with a with a PhD

1996
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,159
student a while ago

1997
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,719
gold spaces of openness Urban

1998
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:23,219
citizenship and cultural infrastructures

1999
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:25,080
have come alive in Istanbul

2000
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,000
which focused in let's say a more

2001
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,040
institutional way perhaps less

2002
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,380
ethnographic way on the institutional

2003
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,360
geography of collaboration and support

2004
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,060
to sustain local cultural spaces and

2005
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,760
networks in the shadow of the states so

2006
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,620
the argument we develop here is that in

2007
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,659
in a turkey and and partially also

2008
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,000
nistable increasingly being let's say

2009
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,300
shaped by a kind of authoritarian

2010
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,159
semi-authoritarian state in any case we

2011
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,080
discuss in some detail how particular

2012
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,060
cultural organizations salt and pepper

2013
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,920
for those that know as Istanbul they

2014
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,500
might know the organizations how they

2015
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,540
act as kind of cultural infrastructures

2016
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:03,480
of let's say common life or a different

2017
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,980
way would be saying oh actually Public

2018
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:08,460
public life in Istanbul largely by

2019
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,199
actually collaborating with very many

2020
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:12,600
other organizations but also offering

2021
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,520
spaces and this is what the image to the

2022
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,520
right shows sorry what this image shows

2023
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,920
offering spaces

2024
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,800
um uh well no sorry offering actual

2025
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,600
space in their buildings to all kinds of

2026
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,000
different organs positions so you see a

2027
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,620
kind of let's say

2028
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,659
hidden or semi-hidden cultural

2029
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:32,520
infrastructure which doesn't easily show

2030
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,260
when you look at just the main cultural

2031
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,420
organizations but which really shaped

2032
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,340
you could say cultural practices in this

2033
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:40,080
particular City and which is only

2034
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,600
possible or or in any case is made

2035
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,540
possible by the actual existence of

2036
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,880
these actual spaces in in these cities

2037
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,280
of salt and Depot

2038
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,820
so again another

2039
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:55,199
possible let's say entry point into

2040
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,300
research on cultural infrastructures and

2041
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,880
informal urbanism

2042
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,000
last Point perhaps for this slide well

2043
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
not not the level yeah last example is

2044
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,679
what we see happening in the research

2045
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,300
and cultural infrastructures much of the

2046
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,100
research on Urban culture is research

2047
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,780
that is both you could say fundamental

2048
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:16,620
let's say basic basic real academic

2049
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,600
research but it also has a strong

2050
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,280
applied nature and the notion of

2051
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,900
infrastructure has also started to

2052
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:24,600
emerging or started popping up in policy

2053
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,060
documents across the world

2054
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,699
um that has many consequences not all of

2055
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:31,380
them positive but to a large extent I

2056
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,780
think it's an interesting development

2057
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:36,500
where we let's say cultural policy

2058
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,880
documents and cultural actual cultural

2059
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,219
policy practices did not refer to

2060
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:43,199
infrastructure let's say 10 years ago we

2061
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,000
see in the last five years or so we see

2062
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,159
various organizations very local and

2063
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:49,199
Regional governments actually using the

2064
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:51,960
notion of infrastructure in order to pay

2065
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,219
attention to certain let's say

2066
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:55,080
infrastructural dimensions of of of

2067
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,260
cultural of the cultural Industries also

2068
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,960
so here are a few examples on the top

2069
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,239
left creative City News cultural

2070
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:04,920
infrastructure an integral component of

2071
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,260
Canadian communities this is quite

2072
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,000
strong and again I think it's critique

2073
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,500
of the creative Industries literature

2074
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,719
even among policy makers where you say

2075
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,820
okay we actually need a wider diversity

2076
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,219
of cultural infrastructures that

2077
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:18,840
actually connect with our local

2078
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,120
communities whatever that may mean but

2079
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,739
that's let's say the game

2080
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:25,199
or for example sustaining London as a

2081
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,360
cultural capital why London needs a

2082
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,640
cultural infrastructure plan this again

2083
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,560
is not a strand of the debate I think in

2084
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,020
policy communities where we see because

2085
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,219
of the increasing let's say

2086
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:37,199
gentrification and increasing real

2087
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,060
estate price and especially Global

2088
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:42,239
cities even policy makers let's say or

2089
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,640
let's say mainstream policy has started

2090
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,320
realizing that if we continue like this

2091
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,060
we will have no artists left in the city

2092
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,219
so we need to actually start thinking

2093
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:52,380
about the availability of cultural

2094
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,900
infrastructure in our cities and to make

2095
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,300
this available literally in order to

2096
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:00,960
sort of uh keep let's say the status of

2097
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,880
London as a global City but also as a

2098
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,920
cultural City so why London is the

2099
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,900
cultural infrastructure plan

2100
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,880
a similar debate around cultural

2101
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,620
infrastructure in New South Wales which

2102
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,199
is this mixer thing also of the Canadian

2103
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:14,820
example I just mentioned and the London

2104
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,520
example of availability of space or

2105
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,260
another example in Brussels and this is

2106
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,300
one I'm partially involved in by

2107
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,239
permanent so permanent uh the the name

2108
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,100
of the of the association pretty much

2109
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,440
sums it up which is a kind of practice

2110
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,360
based research I'm also now involved in

2111
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,860
where we try to develop an

2112
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,300
infrastructure for permanently

2113
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,040
affordable and a valid social and

2114
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,320
cultural space in Brussels so basically

2115
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,199
claiming a space in Brussels which is

2116
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:43,320
open not just to artists but also other

2117
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,600
types of users such as refugees such as

2118
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,640
social housing such as University

2119
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,520
researchers Etc in order to look at

2120
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,860
different models of ownership also where

2121
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:55,140
ours are no longer Reliant and other

2122
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,719
users on let's say temporary use but I

2123
01:21:57,719 --> 01:21:59,159
can actually let's say permanently

2124
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:01,980
literally permanently claim a space

2125
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,140
through all kinds of ownership models

2126
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:05,880
partially building on issues around

2127
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,100
unless the community land for us or

2128
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,920
social cooperatives

2129
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,239
cheese

2130
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,880
okay that's a lot of information

2131
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,880
um just to sum this up if you look at

2132
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:18,900
the cultural infrastructures and

2133
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,000
informal urbanism literature I see at

2134
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,159
least the following analytical shifts

2135
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:26,760
we have moved the thing from a concern

2136
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,199
with the informal economy and

2137
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:29,760
anthropology and development studies and

2138
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,440
everyday life tactics and cultural

2139
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,679
studies to INF to informal urbanism this

2140
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:36,480
is the term that is perhaps most present

2141
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,060
now it's no longer informality as such

2142
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:40,980
but the phrase informal urbanism you see

2143
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,659
uh constantly

2144
01:22:42,659 --> 01:22:45,360
so we've moved to a situation where

2145
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,820
um sorry here we are

2146
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:50,340
we see a continued interest in labor

2147
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,900
questions social embeddedness of

2148
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,239
economic relations and interrelation of

2149
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,100
informal networks and the formal

2150
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,600
institutions so all the classic

2151
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,420
informality discussions but at the same

2152
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,340
time we see a diversification of topics

2153
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,800
so it's no longer just about we would

2154
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,679
say beautiful labor markets no it's also

2155
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,440
about di urbanism it's also about

2156
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,179
co-working space it is also about

2157
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:14,760
Guerilla gardening about co-housing or

2158
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,380
about artistic interventions in public

2159
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,420
space it's also about squatting it's

2160
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,760
also about self-built housing and the

2161
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,100
list is endless yeah all these kinds of

2162
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,960
practices of course each but they're all

2163
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,360
with their own and I see approaches and

2164
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,280
styles you see all these kinds of

2165
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,679
practice being

2166
01:23:30,679 --> 01:23:34,080
labeled as expressions of informal

2167
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,340
urbanism

2168
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,739
there's a legitimate question to ask how

2169
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:40,140
useful such a slippery term is but it

2170
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,760
has certainly led to a broadening of

2171
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,380
empirical interests

2172
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:45,780
as already mentioned before I think the

2173
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:48,420
the term informal has really helped to

2174
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:50,820
move Beyond a global South versus global

2175
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,100
North studies on cities and to really

2176
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,020
look at the informal urbanism AS Global

2177
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:57,659
urbanism where the informal in a way has

2178
01:23:57,659 --> 01:23:59,760
become foundational to our understanding

2179
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,620
of cities at Large

2180
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,020
uh and the last point I'll skip uh for

2181
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:06,600
now is less essential

2182
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,420
okay I need a sip of water

2183
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,000
um questions please or or comments or

2184
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,640
additions uh on this on this part

2185
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:20,900
if any

2186
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,719
um maybe I could ask a question about

2187
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:30,360
um let's say these structures these

2188
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,980
infrastructures growing in the shadow of

2189
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,020
the state as you have mentioned it so we

2190
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:35,340
noticed that

2191
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,080
um actually a lot of communes in

2192
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:40,860
Brussels are trying to set themselves on

2193
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:44,100
the let's say cultural map and we are

2194
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,840
working in urban analysis on the

2195
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,060
community Forge that has its own like a

2196
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:50,280
very active plan and wants to be a

2197
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,500
leader and a new place for art and

2198
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,199
culture in Brussels yes I wonder what

2199
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,739
your take on that was also working with

2200
01:24:58,739 --> 01:25:00,659
um with the association that you

2201
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:02,040
mentioned you must be seeing also a

2202
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,739
different side of of the the influence

2203
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:08,460
of of local yeah local government in

2204
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:11,600
Brussels on that yeah exactly yeah

2205
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,460
I mean I mean asking a question about a

2206
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:15,960
city in which which I live of course is

2207
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,040
always difficult because I can talk

2208
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,320
about this for hours but

2209
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:19,980
um

2210
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,320
it's a tricky I mean I would say for

2211
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,780
that to a large extent has become a a

2212
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:27,060
creative or cultural hub for artists

2213
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,940
which is really which it obviously is uh

2214
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:33,420
despite for a municipality uh as as

2215
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,980
often happens in Russell is not because

2216
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,739
of the government that we see uh

2217
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:39,480
interesting activity happening somewhere

2218
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:42,480
Russell is a city that really relies a

2219
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,980
thing on on strong let's say um uh well

2220
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,560
social movements and citizen activity uh

2221
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,820
and this also applies a thing to

2222
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:53,340
Artistic activity in Forever have you

2223
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:54,840
said that what of course what you now

2224
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,659
see happening is that because for the uh

2225
01:25:57,659 --> 01:26:00,780
it has become let's see uh let's say a

2226
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,300
concentration uh let's say for for

2227
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:06,060
artists uh we do see of course that

2228
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:07,800
local municipality is increasingly also

2229
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,320
using this to in a way to to to to Brand

2230
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,199
itself right to to uh as such there is

2231
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:14,699
nothing wrong with this

2232
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:17,280
uh I mean I don't live in Florida we

2233
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,840
need to look into a very specific local

2234
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,460
details at the same time I don't have

2235
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:21,620
the feeling

2236
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:25,320
that they have a strong strategic

2237
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,860
perspective and for that on the role of

2238
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,360
of arts and culture in their

2239
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,420
municipality so it doesn't and that's

2240
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:35,100
apply this applies to process as a whole

2241
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:37,440
I think it doesn't get to my knowledge

2242
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:41,100
move Beyond a kind of offering of

2243
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:44,219
temporary interim use spaces for artists

2244
01:26:44,219 --> 01:26:46,260
so there doesn't yet seem to be a kind

2245
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,659
of broader let's say more substantial

2246
01:26:48,659 --> 01:26:50,280
perspective on this but maybe you

2247
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,719
already know more about this through the

2248
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:53,760
urban analysis and and the work that

2249
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,600
you've done so far

2250
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,639
I think we we definitely see a lot of

2251
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:02,580
policy claims for sure and a lot of use

2252
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,540
of it

2253
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:05,760
um so now indeed it's a next challenge

2254
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,980
to look into how that actually plays out

2255
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:10,199
on the ground and whether that actually

2256
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:11,639
translates into action but thank you for

2257
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:14,960
your reaction yes okay thank you

2258
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,639
a comment as well

2259
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:21,300
um last year I did uh literature study

2260
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:24,239
about gentrification in Brussels yeah

2261
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,179
especially in the region of um

2262
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:29,280
since molenberg

2263
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,620
and we saw

2264
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,780
um in the 80s there come a lot of

2265
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,179
artists start living there

2266
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:39,239
so it became very popular to to live

2267
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:42,659
there and the results was poor people

2268
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:45,239
poor people need to move out

2269
01:27:45,239 --> 01:27:48,540
so I guess there is always

2270
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:53,639
a small dark sites of this one let's do

2271
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:55,500
gentle Creations especially in in

2272
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,199
Brussels yeah yeah I mean I can only say

2273
01:27:58,199 --> 01:28:01,400
I showed yes to that

2274
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,080
um yeah I mean I mean I mean there's

2275
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,520
there are different opinions on

2276
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,860
gentrification and Brussels I mean some

2277
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:09,600
would say well there's clear

2278
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,400
gentrification and B and there's there's

2279
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,260
expulsion

2280
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,159
um

2281
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,380
if you look at the numbers that my the

2282
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,060
actual expulsion of people from a

2283
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,620
certain localities might be limited

2284
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:21,480
still but it's clear that certain

2285
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,120
certain areas are changing rapidly

2286
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,620
um one of the things we're trying to do

2287
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:26,940
which for example the permanent project

2288
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:29,159
I'm permanent project I mentioned is to

2289
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:30,900
also think about spatial because one of

2290
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,760
the problems is let's say artists move

2291
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,159
into certain spaces they're looking for

2292
01:28:35,159 --> 01:28:37,980
let's say work and Living Spaces but in

2293
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,199
a way unintendedly so data and actually

2294
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:42,900
lead to a push out effect for other uh

2295
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,120
for adolescent poor poor citizens in

2296
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,800
most cases

2297
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,960
at the same time it's not as if artists

2298
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,639
are belong let's say to an urban Elite

2299
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:51,719
in general

2300
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:54,780
so one is on a very small level what

2301
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:55,860
we're trying to do with the permanent

2302
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:57,840
project is also try to think of let's

2303
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,360
say spaces that are that are co-owned

2304
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,480
and where let's say the the move of

2305
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,699
artists into a certain area does not

2306
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:07,260
automatically translate into the move

2307
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:11,280
out of other citizens uh

2308
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,199
realistically speaking of course my

2309
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,320
position on this is that

2310
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,940
this can only partially be solved on the

2311
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:19,739
project level because practically

2312
01:29:19,739 --> 01:29:21,000
speaking you simply need more social

2313
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
housing for this and muscles is is a

2314
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,440
disastrous City when it comes to

2315
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,380
percentage of social housing let alone

2316
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:30,060
qualitative social housing we're really

2317
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:31,820
talking about a few percentages

2318
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:35,219
uh of the total housing stock which is

2319
01:29:35,219 --> 01:29:37,020
social housing which is completely

2320
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:38,760
different for example in a city such as

2321
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,500
such as Amsterdam which has also seen

2322
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,780
gentrification obviously but that's the

2323
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,880
social housing stock definitely helps

2324
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,159
there which all is all is its own

2325
01:29:47,159 --> 01:29:51,920
complexities and problems so yeah

2326
01:29:53,219 --> 01:29:56,540
any other comments

2327
01:29:57,739 --> 01:30:01,440
no okay then I'll move to the like the

2328
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,080
last section I think of the

2329
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,179
of the the the session I think we're

2330
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:08,040
more or less okay on time

2331
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,679
which is good so I I what I did I

2332
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:12,060
promised last week that I would also

2333
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,100
have a separate section on tourism I

2334
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,280
don't so I didn't manage to fit it in

2335
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,080
and uh it's it's picked up in some of

2336
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,540
these elements implicitly I think so

2337
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,219
um I'm also less of an expert on Urban

2338
01:30:23,219 --> 01:30:24,960
tourism I know the literature quite well

2339
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,159
but it's not something that I do

2340
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,560
research on myself uh but this is

2341
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,060
certainly also a let's see another

2342
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,280
strand of research which would be is

2343
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,900
interesting from an urban cultural

2344
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,420
perspective

2345
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:37,860
however the last strand I want to

2346
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:39,780
discuss with you today is is literature

2347
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,520
which is perhaps more closely related to

2348
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,380
the humanities than some other elements

2349
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:46,320
I that I that I discussed with you today

2350
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,320
um which I flag here as the research on

2351
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,840
sensory urbanism visual cultures or

2352
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,400
sensory urbanism and then two examples

2353
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,460
visual cultures and sounds

2354
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,620
um the Brian largest text that was on

2355
01:30:58,620 --> 01:30:59,699
your reading for today already

2356
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:01,440
highlighted I think how media

2357
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,139
Technologies and Aesthetics shape Urban

2358
01:31:04,139 --> 01:31:06,600
places so this idea that actually by

2359
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,800
building certain distribution

2360
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,719
infrastructures by having certain places

2361
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:12,300
you actually shape Urban places through

2362
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,920
through these Technologies and

2363
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,380
Aesthetics in turn and this you could

2364
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:18,380
see is let's say the more experiential

2365
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:20,940
phenomenological or or user point of

2366
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,280
view this implies also that places are

2367
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,280
experienced through multiple senses

2368
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,840
seeing listening smelling touching

2369
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,480
tasting now historically most research

2370
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,940
has focused on the visual Dimension but

2371
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:34,739
increasingly we also see it and this has

2372
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,360
a long long history I'll give a few

2373
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,040
simple examples in a minute

2374
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,600
but increasingly you also see the

2375
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,120
attention paid to other sciences and

2376
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,679
I'll briefly discuss tourists to

2377
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,719
research which I think is pretty

2378
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:47,159
interesting but obviously I'm biased

2379
01:31:47,159 --> 01:31:50,400
because I I tend to like mostly or Focus

2380
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,760
mostly on on Music and Sound myself

2381
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,340
um but I'll briefly discuss uh some of

2382
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,719
the research on let's see auditory

2383
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:00,360
culture Sonic cultures or Music and

2384
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:02,600
Sound

2385
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:05,040
now to start with the visual ecology

2386
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,440
spots so remember Jameson so this is

2387
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,780
let's say the the the hotel that was

2388
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,120
already discussed uh in the in the

2389
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,060
Jameson text 1984. basically you could

2390
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,800
say one element of if not star

2391
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,900
architecture but at least let's see very

2392
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:21,000
sort of in your face uh phase

2393
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,880
architecture and within Urban studies a

2394
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,620
lot of attention has been paid to this

2395
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,420
kind of architecture so basically

2396
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:29,280
buildings designed to leave a strong

2397
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,320
visual impression because that is what

2398
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:32,940
these buildings do and what they aim to

2399
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:35,400
do now the analytical Focus starting

2400
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,340
already in the 1980s some elements have

2401
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:40,320
let's say survived the years others have

2402
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,900
not has been on cognitive disorientation

2403
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,480
but also on Landmark statements in a

2404
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,520
city with an emphasis on spectacle and

2405
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,080
surveillance with emphasis and

2406
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,659
consumption Landscapes and an emphasis

2407
01:32:51,659 --> 01:32:53,639
on representation and Global

2408
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:55,920
attractiveness so this is all you see

2409
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,199
well rehearsed territory within Urban

2410
01:32:58,199 --> 01:33:01,199
studies and which has a long history of

2411
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:04,920
of analysis now star architecture you

2412
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:08,580
literally adds value to world cities or

2413
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:10,679
aspiring world cities so the

2414
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:12,239
architecture becomes you could say an

2415
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:15,360
urban icon in global rankings it really

2416
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,860
helps and years there is a tourism

2417
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:19,440
reference it really helps to put world

2418
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,360
cities on the map for tourism and

2419
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,860
consumption purposes

2420
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:25,560
uh these sites or or the surrounding

2421
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,820
areas become size for business

2422
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:29,520
Investments uh or also for up Market

2423
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,500
residential housing so they literally

2424
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,560
add value to aspiring the world cities

2425
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,639
true you could say strong visual claims

2426
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:40,679
now this has this of course has a

2427
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:42,540
history right this is not we have we

2428
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,639
should not be naiveless historically a

2429
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,679
leaf and pretend that this is something

2430
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:49,440
of let's say the post for this age or

2431
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,880
something that we've only seen since the

2432
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,980
late 20th century although it probably

2433
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:56,100
has increased and probably let's say

2434
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,980
more let's say professional and

2435
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:01,139
strategic attention is now being paid a

2436
01:34:01,139 --> 01:34:02,699
paid to let's say the visual dimension

2437
01:34:02,699 --> 01:34:05,340
of cities compared to the let's say the

2438
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,360
the

2439
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:09,120
the decades before but it has a much

2440
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,219
longer history the most and most obvious

2441
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:12,780
or let's say a classic example of course

2442
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:15,420
being the Eiffel Tower which itself was

2443
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,360
built to put Paris on the map or to make

2444
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,239
it more visual Again part of let's say a

2445
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:23,880
broader broader exhibition setup you

2446
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,500
know originally intended temporary but

2447
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,719
has been there for quite some time and

2448
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:30,480
which now is a classic Landmark case in

2449
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,460
uh or example in oops sorry

2450
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,600
around the world when people think about

2451
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,800
Paris sorry

2452
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,719
or another example

2453
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:43,739
um

2454
01:34:43,739 --> 01:34:45,540
so I'm working with two two computers

2455
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:48,600
here so this is sometimes confusing uh

2456
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,460
another example the Opera housing City

2457
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,440
again an example even if you've never

2458
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,360
visited Sydney you will know this

2459
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,219
building the Opera House in Sydney

2460
01:34:56,219 --> 01:34:59,520
architect you're on utsan uh or another

2461
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,980
example which I think by now also

2462
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:03,719
everyone knows which is perhaps you in a

2463
01:35:03,719 --> 01:35:05,580
way the more recent example the gubernet

2464
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:09,900
museum in Bilbao Spain which in its very

2465
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:14,340
setup uh was intended to leave Legacy a

2466
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:16,920
visual impression and you will see that

2467
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,120
many people visit the Google night

2468
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,580
Museum in Bilbao without seeing anything

2469
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,159
else or any or very little of Bilbao as

2470
01:35:23,159 --> 01:35:26,940
such so I would I would dare to to claim

2471
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:28,739
that the vast majority of people that

2472
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:31,620
visit the Google Museum in Bilbao will

2473
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:33,840
leave the city Without Really knowing

2474
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,540
much about Bilbao yeah I mean there's

2475
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:37,860
not a question if they should be it

2476
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:39,780
should but it's clear that this kind of

2477
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:42,060
a visual attraction plays a key role and

2478
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:43,679
it has played out at the same time in

2479
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,620
almost role in increasing tourism flows

2480
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:48,480
towards Bilbao

2481
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,880
or an even more recent Example The

2482
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,719
Helpful Harmony the Opera House in

2483
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:58,739
Hamburg uh 800 million euros enormously

2484
01:35:58,739 --> 01:36:00,719
over budget which is very typical also

2485
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:03,060
for some a lot of the star architecture

2486
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:05,040
but in general though and not

2487
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,840
surprisingly perhaps also is that many

2488
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,639
of these buildings are cultural

2489
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:10,440
landmarks that both offer you could say

2490
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:12,960
culture and a design space for tourism

2491
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,060
and consumption yeah

2492
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:17,340
so this as I said this is well rehearsed

2493
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:18,719
territory still a lot of interesting

2494
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:20,639
research is being done on this but it's

2495
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:24,780
it's quite established in in the base

2496
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:26,280
I'll give some examples of course that

2497
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,020
leads to all kinds of discussions also

2498
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,400
about

2499
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,260
um who has the biggest tower I won't go

2500
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,940
into sort of the masculine connotations

2501
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,340
of building the world's tall tallest

2502
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,980
building but it's quite obvious here uh

2503
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:40,620
the Burj Khalifa and also I think and

2504
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,659
this is perhaps a shift which is newer

2505
01:36:42,659 --> 01:36:45,120
uh although and also not completely new

2506
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,580
is that especially unless the world

2507
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:49,620
global cities such as New York such as

2508
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,780
London we see a lot of intention being

2509
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:53,340
paid by private developers to very

2510
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,100
up-market elite residential housing yeah

2511
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:59,040
so this is height one uh in in London

2512
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,520
for example

2513
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:05,580
it is interesting also because these

2514
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:06,960
there's some of these space for up

2515
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,940
Market residential housing they are

2516
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:10,620
built to leave a visual impact they are

2517
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,500
built to attract buyers multi buyers but

2518
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,179
let's say the running joke in a way or

2519
01:37:15,179 --> 01:37:16,860
low the sadness of the story in many

2520
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:20,760
ways is that if you look at uh how well

2521
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,620
for which period of the Year these are

2522
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:24,659
Partners or builds are actually occupied

2523
01:37:24,659 --> 01:37:27,300
by actual actual inhabitants is often

2524
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,980
quite limited some of these are just

2525
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:31,860
Apartments to park uh to park like money

2526
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:34,500
but not Nest or do laundry money but not

2527
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,840
necessary to actually live there for for

2528
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,179
a sustainers well substantial period of

2529
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:41,219
the year

2530
01:37:41,219 --> 01:37:43,159
foreign

2531
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:47,580
or another example in New York for 423

2532
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:49,620
Park Avenue

2533
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,960
um perhaps less spectacular but maybe

2534
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,520
intend in a similar Direction at least

2535
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,580
visually speaking uh is this building at

2536
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,040
the in the Canal Zone the upside Tower

2537
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,260
in Brussels but the prices are certainly

2538
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,719
more affordable than what the price you

2539
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:07,620
will see in uh in New York or London

2540
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,600
now what's interesting about this this

2541
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,340
visual cultures especially in sort of

2542
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:14,400
New Media times is that these let's say

2543
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,139
these Landmark statements these are

2544
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:17,699
actual buildings these are buildings

2545
01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:20,159
very much let's say uh very costly

2546
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:24,120
investments in urban space uh but the

2547
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,920
vast majority of people will know these

2548
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,360
buildings they will see these buildings

2549
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,460
through social media and online

2550
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:31,800
magazines or maybe the let's say a

2551
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,320
coffee table book magazines yeah so

2552
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,120
these these buildings play a massive an

2553
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,460
important role in City branding and

2554
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,080
hopefully attracting cultural tourism

2555
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,600
and also in circulating on social media

2556
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,699
so you've got images such as this where

2557
01:38:44,699 --> 01:38:46,139
sort of if you look at Instagram and

2558
01:38:46,139 --> 01:38:48,120
search for Star architecture or

2559
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,480
spectacular architecture you will see

2560
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:53,580
loads of images or even let's say New

2561
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:57,060
York using using uh using let's say

2562
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:59,340
certain space or new builds in New York

2563
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,800
and labeling it as best Instagram spots

2564
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,659
and then you get these uh this

2565
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:05,100
interesting uh let's say tourism

2566
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,440
basically photograph themselves with the

2567
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,600
building in the background as a candles

2568
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,679
let's say

2569
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:13,320
uh I've been there kind of attitudes but

2570
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,239
it's quite obvious where sort of the the

2571
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:17,340
spectacular Arctic plays a key role not

2572
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:19,560
in relation to questions actual use but

2573
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,300
largely in regression in relation to

2574
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,460
questions of representation and how can

2575
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:25,980
you actually uh how do how well do these

2576
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:28,260
images look like on Instagram or other

2577
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,860
websites

2578
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:35,880
now this is empirically this is

2579
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,340
interesting he's a new phenomena with

2580
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:39,780
longer histories but empirically

2581
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:41,880
interesting theoretically it raises

2582
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,260
certain questions about how we should

2583
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:46,320
look like how we should look at at city

2584
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,000
development and how we should look at

2585
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,719
how cities uh change over time this ties

2586
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:53,280
then I would argue with a literature on

2587
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,960
what is sometimes called geographies of

2588
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,120
circulation where we really try to

2589
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,400
understand City cultures as an effect of

2590
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,920
circulation so not necessarily designed

2591
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,900
locally but actually images traveling

2592
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:06,360
between cities of course also traveling

2593
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,639
of Architects and other experts but also

2594
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:11,639
Concepts images plans best practices so

2595
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:13,739
my Urban culture as such perhaps also

2596
01:40:13,739 --> 01:40:15,900
Urban policy as such becomes a kind of

2597
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,000
practice of inter-inter referencing so

2598
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,580
cities referencing each other or

2599
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:22,860
buildings referencing each other to to

2600
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:25,020
to to to to stake out a claim so to

2601
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:25,679
speak

2602
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,500
now all this leaves back in my view

2603
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,120
although not always recognized as such

2604
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,159
with the Innovative nervous studies do

2605
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,840
classic cultural studies concerns with

2606
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,480
the politics of representation but also

2607
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,040
to an anthropological interest and

2608
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,320
there's a very nice book an article also

2609
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,440
by Ayana already from the late 1980s on

2610
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,719
the social life of objects so how do

2611
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:49,080
objects travel through space and Through

2612
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:51,380
Time

2613
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,320
okay

2614
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,239
last section for today because this as I

2615
01:40:57,239 --> 01:40:58,980
said is it's well well throttling Theory

2616
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:00,719
within Urban studies to really look at

2617
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:03,540
sort of the visual in relation to to the

2618
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:04,739
urban

2619
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:07,260
but especially uh yeah the last 10 20

2620
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:08,820
years I guess we see an increasing

2621
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,739
interest also in other sciences and the

2622
01:41:10,739 --> 01:41:12,900
urban the example I briefly want to

2623
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,639
discuss with you today as a closure for

2624
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:17,760
the lecture uh isn't it is um research

2625
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,380
and auditory Sonic cultures the

2626
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,840
vocabulary tends to differ

2627
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,820
um there's a lot of interesting work

2628
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:26,040
being done on this still sometimes also

2629
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,139
by practicing uh practicing artists

2630
01:41:28,139 --> 01:41:30,179
practicing musicians that also writes

2631
01:41:30,179 --> 01:41:32,820
such as for example Brandon LaBelle who

2632
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,619
wrote quite a nice book on acoustic

2633
01:41:34,619 --> 01:41:36,300
territories sound culture and everyday

2634
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,239
life so you see again everyday life

2635
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:43,199
returning as a as a as vocabulary so in

2636
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:45,420
chapter 3 for example which is the some

2637
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:47,880
of the examples I use here where you

2638
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,800
explicitly bills on micheliness of those

2639
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,840
the practice of everyday life a very

2640
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,080
develop the view on walking not an in a

2641
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,239
visual way as actually the setode did

2642
01:41:57,239 --> 01:41:58,679
because he had a lot of discussions to

2643
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:00,540
do about how you look in relation to

2644
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:01,980
building how you position yourself in

2645
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:04,139
relation to the city but a very develops

2646
01:42:04,139 --> 01:42:06,360
with you and walk through an auditory or

2647
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:09,000
rhythmic perspectives and then he gives

2648
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,920
all kinds of examples such as crosswalk

2649
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:13,560
signals warning warning alarms or

2650
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,360
personal audio so looking listening on

2651
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,860
your smartphone to music while walking

2652
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:18,719
through the city but also for example

2653
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,300
sound art or marching bands or protests

2654
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,760
and they're all sound plays and let's

2655
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,940
say experiencing and and structuring uh

2656
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:30,239
let's say city city life

2657
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,219
he gives the example for example of

2658
01:42:32,219 --> 01:42:35,400
floriano jumano and fallante Sao Paulo I

2659
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,719
think he actually mentions as Rio

2660
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,840
dictionary but I think it's in Sao Paulo

2661
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,900
um we walked around uh with with a big

2662
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:46,860
speaker on us on his back uh which

2663
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:47,880
basically

2664
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,639
um where the voice is speaking out loud

2665
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,260
don't don't something like don't pay

2666
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:54,600
attention if I remember correctly so he

2667
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,100
was walking around the streets in public

2668
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:58,260
space don't pay attention don't pay

2669
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:00,420
attention don't pay attention which

2670
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:02,400
obviously the exact opposite will then

2671
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,119
happen which is a pretty nice or neat uh

2672
01:43:06,119 --> 01:43:08,460
intervention I think in in public space

2673
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:12,119
as a kind of art project

2674
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:14,580
another example is okay is that that we

2675
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:16,679
have active networks this is a much

2676
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:18,659
longer history also of field recorders

2677
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:20,639
people doing field recordings but

2678
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:22,320
there's a very nice website for those

2679
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,960
that are that are into this stuff uh

2680
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,880
which uh it's called sound cities just

2681
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,219
Google it you'll find it which has

2682
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:31,380
connected let's say field records from

2683
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:33,659
cities across the world where you can

2684
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:35,280
actually play well this has been mapped

2685
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,380
literally on the map of these cities and

2686
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:39,360
where you can play Let's see sounds from

2687
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,739
these cities or from these particular

2688
01:43:40,739 --> 01:43:43,260
locations in these cities uh and that's

2689
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,119
that's an ever-growing database but

2690
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,219
there's also active community of sound

2691
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:49,980
recorders field recorders recording

2692
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,960
sounds are cities and it's quite nice if

2693
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,060
you have a bit of time to let's say to

2694
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:55,800
go through some of the sounds and also

2695
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,560
experience some of the let's say

2696
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,880
differences and sounds uh between

2697
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:03,020
between different cities

2698
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:06,300
one example I want to just briefly play

2699
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:08,460
and I hope this all works with uh with

2700
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:09,659
sounds I'm just going to play it and

2701
01:44:09,659 --> 01:44:10,860
then you're gonna have to tell me if you

2702
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:12,659
hear the sound so turn on do turn on the

2703
01:44:12,659 --> 01:44:15,540
sounds uh is a very nice piece I think

2704
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,760
by Felix bloom a Mexican artist simaphor

2705
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,820
was so normal from Mexico City 2015.

2706
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:22,739
very

2707
01:44:22,739 --> 01:44:25,020
um basically manipulated the walking

2708
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:27,780
signals uh of

2709
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:30,000
um on the street in um

2710
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,699
uh in Mexico City and when we replace

2711
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:34,679
the sound of a pedestrian traffic light

2712
01:44:34,679 --> 01:44:36,659
with the sound uh with like let's say

2713
01:44:36,659 --> 01:44:38,400
the classic sound with the sound of a

2714
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,400
donkey uh which according to him is a

2715
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,860
nice way of of well paying attention to

2716
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:46,440
well first of all making people think

2717
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:48,060
differently look differently wait this

2718
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:49,500
is something else than I expected so

2719
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,900
it's a kind of intervention but also a

2720
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,460
bit directing attention to an animal

2721
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:55,260
which is largely disappeared from Mexico

2722
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:58,800
City uh says this Urban space which uh

2723
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,199
which uh was different let's say 30 40

2724
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:03,719
50 years ago so I'm just gonna look if

2725
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:04,980
this works and you're gonna have to tell

2726
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:07,560
me just do it like this or something if

2727
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,520
the sound is okay

2728
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,480
do you hear sounds

2729
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:19,340
okay perfect now please play

2730
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:44,250
[Music]

2731
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:58,699
[Music]

2732
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:08,300
foreign

2733
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:23,770
[Music]

2734
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:33,780
okay so just one one small example which

2735
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:36,659
I thought is a pretty pretty nice

2736
01:46:36,659 --> 01:46:37,260
um

2737
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:40,199
nice intervention with a lot of humor uh

2738
01:46:40,199 --> 01:46:42,179
Felix Bloom also did quite he's done a

2739
01:46:42,179 --> 01:46:43,679
lot of work as a sound artist he also

2740
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,480
did quite some interesting work and this

2741
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:47,520
is a kind of early work you could argue

2742
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,159
but where later on he actually worked in

2743
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:52,980
collaboration with blind people uh to

2744
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,960
actually and and use let's say sounds

2745
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,239
and their experience of urban space in

2746
01:46:57,239 --> 01:46:59,340
order to sort of make make artistic uh

2747
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:00,900
well it's artistic projects which is

2748
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:02,699
also some interesting work to just check

2749
01:47:02,699 --> 01:47:04,980
his website if you're interested in this

2750
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:07,139
kind of stuff

2751
01:47:07,139 --> 01:47:09,540
this example I'll move to the very end

2752
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:12,659
which is a nice example by the way of

2753
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:14,820
of sound and protests and there are many

2754
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:17,960
examples of this following the 2011

2755
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,940
Fukushima Fukushima nuclear accident in

2756
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:24,420
Japan Japan saw actually a wide range of

2757
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,440
public protests here's one example which

2758
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,440
was a sound demo organized by a loose

2759
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,360
association called shirota noiran

2760
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,940
amateur revolt

2761
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:37,500
and the organized a kind of sound demo

2762
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,179
protest which is pretty neat if you like

2763
01:47:39,179 --> 01:47:41,760
noise which I do but since it's a 10

2764
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,679
minute video I will

2765
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:48,540
leave this for the very end and close my

2766
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:50,159
sorry that one that will come in a

2767
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:51,020
second

2768
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:53,760
and move to my conclusions

2769
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,860
before I do so are there any questions

2770
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:59,699
on the um on the section on sensory

2771
01:47:59,699 --> 01:48:02,239
urbanism

2772
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,600
and I know it's almost 8 PM so I know

2773
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,100
it's late

2774
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:10,080
yeah just just unmute yourself and start

2775
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,280
talking because I don't see anyone

2776
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,619
everyone in my screen okay I would just

2777
01:48:13,619 --> 01:48:16,800
like to share with with you and with

2778
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,080
whom can be interested about the project

2779
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:23,900
of um sound of tourist tourism

2780
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:27,659
Lisbon he mapped the the sound of

2781
01:48:27,659 --> 01:48:29,219
tourism in the city and it's pretty

2782
01:48:29,219 --> 01:48:31,760
interesting

2783
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,260
I didn't know it yet so I'll check it

2784
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:37,800
out very cool yeah okay thanks

2785
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:40,199
other comments suggestions

2786
01:48:40,199 --> 01:48:42,420
interventions

2787
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:44,400
no

2788
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,440
I will wrap up then with the conclusions

2789
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:48,540
and then after the conclusions I will

2790
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:51,300
move to the to the Tokyo video but

2791
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:52,920
there's obviously no obligation to sit

2792
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,719
through 12 minutes of noise so I'll just

2793
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:56,340
leave it play for those that are

2794
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:59,219
interested uh but I will conclude uh and

2795
01:48:59,219 --> 01:49:01,920
say bye after the after the conclusions

2796
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:05,940
okay to wrap up this uh this relatively

2797
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,800
intense session I think around the

2798
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,540
different strands of research on on

2799
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,600
Urban culture what I tried to get across

2800
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,760
is that research and urban cultures is a

2801
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:16,619
thriving and more perhaps more

2802
01:49:16,619 --> 01:49:18,300
importantly or very all equally

2803
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:19,920
importantly and into a transdisciplinary

2804
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,960
field of research it's increasingly

2805
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,280
difficult to distinguish between

2806
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,260
disciplines in research and urban

2807
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:28,260
cultures which perhaps is a trend that

2808
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:31,380
applies to all teams you could say but I

2809
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:32,580
definitely think it applies more

2810
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:34,920
strongly to research and urban culture

2811
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:37,679
building on 1980s 1990s debate on the

2812
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:39,900
cultural term uh post-modernism and

2813
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:42,239
urban uh and the symbolic economy and

2814
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:43,199
through interaction with Urban

2815
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:44,699
anthropology and cultural studies

2816
01:49:44,699 --> 01:49:46,139
particularly through Notions such as

2817
01:49:46,139 --> 01:49:48,000
informal informality informal urbanism

2818
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,159
everyday life what we see is that Urban

2819
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:51,780
studies is really Diversified into

2820
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:53,699
multiple strands of research dedicated

2821
01:49:53,699 --> 01:49:56,460
to cultural issues it's important to

2822
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,380
make distinctions here because different

2823
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:00,119
strands have different artists have

2824
01:50:00,119 --> 01:50:02,520
different communities of practice but I

2825
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,719
would say there are three different

2826
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:06,360
strands that that that are most

2827
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,040
interesting but they pretty much do

2828
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:09,179
cover it and they're not the only

2829
01:50:09,179 --> 01:50:11,639
strands but I do think they cover uh

2830
01:50:11,639 --> 01:50:14,280
let's say 80 of of the urban studies

2831
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,219
research on Urban culture perhaps with

2832
01:50:17,219 --> 01:50:18,659
the exception of urban tourism and

2833
01:50:18,659 --> 01:50:20,460
cultural issues which I didn't discuss

2834
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:22,920
in detail today the first one being the

2835
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:25,320
Arts activism and urban engagement the

2836
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,760
second cultural infrastructure the

2837
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:28,619
informal urbanism and the third strand

2838
01:50:28,619 --> 01:50:31,020
around sensory urbanism where I give

2839
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:34,139
very briefly two examples on visual

2840
01:50:34,139 --> 01:50:36,119
cultures and sounds

2841
01:50:36,119 --> 01:50:39,780
that's it from my site for today

2842
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:41,480
um if there are no further questions

2843
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:45,780
then I will move back to the uh to this

2844
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:49,020
presentation sorry to this video

2845
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:52,080
um I have one quick question

2846
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,300
um are there any connections between

2847
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:57,239
um Sansui urbanism and clubbing culture

2848
01:50:57,239 --> 01:50:59,400
for instance

2849
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,380
um

2850
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:03,600
limited limited I think it's in the

2851
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,820
research is limited I think the clubbing

2852
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:08,040
culture literature as far as I know it

2853
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,600
is last year literature that builds on

2854
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,219
the LA City Classic cultural studies

2855
01:51:11,219 --> 01:51:12,119
tradition

2856
01:51:12,119 --> 01:51:14,159
focusing on let's say youth culture

2857
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:16,679
popular culture uh sociological

2858
01:51:16,679 --> 01:51:18,600
approaches by and large

2859
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:21,840
however it's if you look at let's say

2860
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,179
practitioners in clubbing culture

2861
01:51:24,179 --> 01:51:25,679
then I think there are stronger

2862
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,840
connections especially those working in

2863
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:31,199
let's say electronic music moving let's

2864
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,659
say from a minimal techno orientation

2865
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:35,940
who have increasingly moved into let's

2866
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:39,360
say modern composition and or indeed

2867
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,580
field work type Fields field recordings

2868
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:44,699
type of work there you will see

2869
01:51:44,699 --> 01:51:45,420
um

2870
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:47,880
artist who

2871
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,639
um well who who sort of transcend the

2872
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:51,840
boundaries who connect these things

2873
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,940
because they then become you could say

2874
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,800
sensory urbanists through their practice

2875
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:58,139
but in the research I would say less so

2876
01:51:58,139 --> 01:51:59,760
they think they seem to be quite

2877
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,800
separate well they are to a large extent

2878
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:03,420
quite separate fields

2879
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:05,280
but which doesn't mean that the

2880
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:06,840
connection cannot be made so that may be

2881
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,780
done your job yeah

2882
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:12,480
well I'm thinking uh

2883
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:15,540
I have one example in mind

2884
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:18,380
um of Tbilisi in Georgia

2885
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:21,960
where last year there were very big

2886
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,820
protests I have to say I really don't

2887
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:25,199
know the details about it but I know

2888
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:26,780
there was also

2889
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:32,040
uh some substantial mobilization from uh

2890
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:36,560
clubs and from people from artists and

2891
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:39,980
people from that scene um

2892
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:42,840
and you saw some sort of a collaboration

2893
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,280
between

2894
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:46,679
yeah these these people from club

2895
01:52:46,679 --> 01:52:48,300
culture so to say and more political

2896
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:51,060
movements and also using music in public

2897
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:54,300
space as a form of protest yeah no that

2898
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,280
that happens of course and I think in in

2899
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:58,260
the Berlin example I used before I think

2900
01:52:58,260 --> 01:52:59,760
you also see these examples of public

2901
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,360
protest and uh and music I mean the the

2902
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,580
classic example of the love love parade

2903
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,199
started out you could say as a political

2904
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,659
movement even though I would argue it's

2905
01:53:09,659 --> 01:53:11,880
that it was heavily commodified soon

2906
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:14,639
after or increasingly so

2907
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:16,739
um but the sensory urbanism literature

2908
01:53:16,739 --> 01:53:18,300
perhaps relates more you could say to

2909
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,219
the experimental sites and to the sound

2910
01:53:20,219 --> 01:53:22,500
not not even necessarily music and

2911
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:24,119
that's a different kind of scene I would

2912
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:26,699
argue and although there is overlap

2913
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:28,380
obviously so yeah

2914
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:32,219
yeah thank you any other comments

2915
01:53:32,219 --> 01:53:33,719
questions

2916
01:53:33,719 --> 01:53:35,760
perhaps just a very practical question

2917
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,159
uh for me regarding the seminars that

2918
01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:41,159
will follow uh in the coming weeks and I

2919
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:42,900
wonder how

2920
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:46,080
um the presentations will will go

2921
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:48,300
I asked because we were asked in the

2922
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:49,619
past to record the video of our

2923
01:53:49,619 --> 01:53:51,239
presentation and I wondered if you

2924
01:53:51,239 --> 01:53:53,280
wanted the same or if we will give that

2925
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:55,020
in person yes the rule would be would

2926
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:56,340
remain the same I think that's how it's

2927
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:57,960
the most communicated also so I would

2928
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:59,219
actually need to look into the details

2929
01:53:59,219 --> 01:54:00,840
myself because I've been busy with with

2930
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:03,179
the lectures so far but the idea would

2931
01:54:03,179 --> 01:54:04,820
still be that

2932
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:08,760
the recordings are well are recorded in

2933
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:11,219
advance and then we have and use and use

2934
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:13,260
email it to me or you and and we

2935
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:15,600
presented yes

2936
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:17,820
thank you so much

2937
01:54:17,820 --> 01:54:21,239
sorry okay yeah okay

2938
01:54:21,239 --> 01:54:23,520
then I will move to the presentation but

2939
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,860
it's 8 P.M so this is just when I say

2940
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:28,100
the hardcore survivors who

2941
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:30,420
want to stick stick around for a bit

2942
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:31,800
longer

2943
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:33,780
um I'm gonna say goodbye in any case I

2944
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:36,600
will also look at it again so you can

2945
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:39,119

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,220
um

23
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,120
so grab a grab a drink a tea or coffee

24
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,160
or whatever it is that you like to drink

25
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
at this time of the day and uh

26
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,540
and let's try to make this as pleasant

27
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,720
and experience as possible so five more

28
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,820
minutes I'm gonna switch up the video

29
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,300
for a moment and join you then

30
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,680
foreign

31
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,940
oh yeah please tell us or tell me in the

32
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,020
chat

33
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,620
um which I have open here just in case

34
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,020
welcome all of you

35
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,000
um I'm sure that you've had that so many

36
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,099
times already I really wish we could

37
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,380
meet face to face in a in an actual

38
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,840
lecture room at Pub

39
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,240
um but uh I'm still happy that we're

40
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,220
doing it in any case in this very

41
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,560
unusual or maybe for you actually

42
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,680
already a very normal format by now who

43
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,699
am I you might be wondering my name is

44
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,440
I am a postdoctoral researcher here at

45
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,240
vub

46
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,699
and I'm the last of the four white males

47
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,500
to tell you everything about urban

48
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,639
geography so uh I come last but I hope

49
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,160
um this was not been a very tiring

50
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,479
course by now and you still have the

51
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,500
energy and then will to to follow

52
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,740
um over the course of the next two

53
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,840
lectures two sessions I will be sharing

54
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,860
with you my perspective my ideas about

55
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,800
Urban transport and Mobility

56
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,440
um well it's a lecture so it's very

57
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,900
difficult to make it highly interactive

58
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,520
but I will still try to ask you some

59
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,080
questions and

60
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,958
um I think I hope it's possible for you

61
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,200
to try to respond to them not only

62
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
through chat but basically you know turn

63
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,580
the audio on video and

64
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,659
um I don't think it will be a

65
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,219
conversation but at least it would be

66
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,779
nice to hear some other voices not only

67
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,060
mine for two hours and then two hours

68
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,580
again and of course this is followed by

69
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,100
a discussion seminar so you will have

70
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,600
read or you have read already some

71
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,880
articles and I hope we will have a

72
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,440
discussion there

73
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,360
um so that we we can make this whole

74
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,240
thing a little bit more interactive than

75
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,459
um then it is usually the case through

76
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,760
these uh online online courses

77
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,260
right

78
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,120
um I hope you can also see the slides

79
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,040
can you not those of you who have the

80
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,300
video on

81
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,540
do you see them perfect very good so

82
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,360
um excellent so Urban transported

83
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,700
Mobility it is uh if you have any

84
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,920
questions concerning the content or I

85
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,959
don't know the quality of uh video audio

86
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,019
let me know in the chat I'll try to read

87
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,320
this as I as I talk

88
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,440
multitasking and try to interrupt me if

89
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,300
you yeah if you have any you know

90
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,760
questions if you disagree if you if you

91
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
have some burning issue let me know or

92
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,500
let us know and then I'll try to stop

93
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,680
and address that all right great so what

94
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,380
is the plan for the next two sessions

95
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,600
today we're going to talk about a

96
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
historical hegemony of two different

97
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,279
main sets of approaches to Urban

98
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,220
Geography of transport and next week

99
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,080
we're going to try to deconstruct all

100
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,760
that to address this in a critical

101
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,399
manner and to understand how to look at

102
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
Urban transport immobility from a

103
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,660
critical set of perspectives

104
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,540
so without further Ado today we're going

105
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,060
to start with a bit of a historical

106
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,680
overview of the relationship between

107
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,080
transport and the city uh how this

108
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,120
relationship evolved in

109
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,339
these two directions

110
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,260
and discuss as much as possible as much

111
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,260
as time will allow us to this historical

112
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,600
hegemony of two main sets of approaches

113
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,300
on Urban transport and geography so

114
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,980
neoclassical and sustainable

115
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,100
perspectives of urban transport

116
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
but before we begin

117
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,779
um I'm really curious about what your

118
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,600
expectations might be I imagine that a

119
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,940
lot of you when you know starting a

120
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,100
course of urban studies or geography

121
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,800
didn't really expect to study transport

122
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,700
why would the transport be important for

123
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,959
understanding cities and their geography

124
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,420
what do you think would any like anybody

125
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,600
like to say something or type it in the

126
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,820
chat that's the moment we're going to

127
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,320
have a few of these open questions

128
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,779
throughout these four hours together

129
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,760
why study transport when studying cities

130
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,380
why why is that important or not

131
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,779
um I I did actually expect transport to

132
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,600
be part of the the study because to me

133
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,560
at least

134
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,779
um it Alters the way the city is

135
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,160
structured sometimes it's structured

136
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,279
around a specific mode of Transport

137
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,860
um like there's differences between

138
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,060
um

139
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,040
um what they call like Harbor cities or

140
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,839
cities more in the middle of land

141
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,459
something and I think it makes a big

142
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,220
difference with how with a geographic

143
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,579
development so to me it's actually I

144
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,820
think it's it's a key factor right so it

145
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,959
would have some impact on the urban

146
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,899
Forum on on so it's spatial arrangement

147
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,000
of the city why else

148
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,680
there are many reasons as you can

149
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,060
imagine but what comes to your mind

150
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,940
I think it also like Matilda already

151
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,300
mentioned before uh one main aspect is

152
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,459
sustainability and cities how to like uh

153
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,899
to to reach the climate goals so okay

154
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,519
it's yeah linked to different

155
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,820
transportation systems or so to think of

156
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,640
let's say environmental impact of of

157
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,620
cities and transport being a big part of

158
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,180
that

159
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,260
um possibly or being part of the the

160
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,800
problem right so generating emissions

161
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,800
CO2 and other gases that yeah

162
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,019
contribute to the climate crisis all

163
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,420
right what else

164
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,060
I think something has to do with job

165
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,720
opportunities

166
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,760
for example in Lagos in Nigeria

167
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,720
we see people moving for hours

168
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,200
um go to town to to look for a job and

169
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,180
go back again so eight hours they're

170
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,420
spending in in casual right right so

171
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,700
transport is well without transport it's

172
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,339
difficult to get around the city and and

173
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,060
use its different functions and uh

174
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,380
use different opportunities that the

175
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,240
city might provide like employment

176
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,019
education Leisure many other things all

177
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:25,820
right

178
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,040
any last point before we move on does

179
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,260
somebody have a great idea to add this

180
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,920
little discussion

181
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,399
well okay well I think today yes it's

182
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,079
quite

183
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,120
um actually is this slide a little bit

184
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,980
cut or do you see it yeah I think this

185
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,440
will be better now so today when you

186
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,779
open the news I think it's difficult to

187
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,360
not to notice that transport is well

188
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,940
very present I would say in the in the

189
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,360
public debate last year I'm just taking

190
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,279
a few examples here last year you

191
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,600
probably

192
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,700
um read about or maybe even participated

193
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,680
in a witnessed huge protests that

194
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,019
erupted in Chile studying in the capital

195
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,839
of the country which of course

196
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,360
very much addressed uh

197
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,399
um fundamental structural issues in

198
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,800
terms of how capitalism develops in this

199
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,380
in this country and how it has its Urban

200
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,139
or spatial impact but the beginning of

201
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,240
the protest was so the final you know

202
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,459
dropped that actually led to the

203
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,800
eruption of those and all those strikes

204
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,779
in these uprisings was the increase of

205
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,600
public transport first and specifically

206
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,160
the underground phase

207
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,920
in Brussels that's the top right corner

208
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,440
we've in the past years we've witnessed

209
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,940
a series of protests in public space

210
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,279
that address uh the increased presence

211
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,920
of the car which supposedly these

212
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,740
protests claim takes space from the from

213
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,540
the people so decrease the quality of

214
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,339
our life

215
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,180
um negatively impact the the quality of

216
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,279
um quality of every living health

217
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,279
conditions especially of of children and

218
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,620
then the figure in the top left I'm sure

219
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,240
that you all know Greta

220
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,420
uh who refers to transport of course she

221
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,740
doesn't talk only about the transport

222
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,600
boy when she does when she makes this

223
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,459
very political statement of not

224
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,320
traveling by plane and using only trains

225
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,399
to go to her meetings or or

226
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,260
conferences at least before copied she

227
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,139
did the idea there is to to show us that

228
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,240
there isn't a necessity for us to engage

229
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,220
in some social and environmental

230
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,860
transition and transport is part of this

231
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,720
transition so the way that we've moved

232
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,760
around the way that we've lived is

233
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,440
essentially unsustainable it's

234
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,940
detrimental from the environmental point

235
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,880
of view we need to change that radically

236
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,899
uh meaning in a very drastic way so

237
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,279
really

238
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,420
um

239
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,639
in a very profound way but also in terms

240
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,560
of speed of that change in order to

241
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,420
address what shared and devices the main

242
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,980
issue today the main problem today which

243
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,899
is the climate crisis or the climate

244
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,300
catastrophe that is that is imminent

245
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,579
it's I think easy to yeah just by

246
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,380
following the news to realize that well

247
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,060
something is profoundly wrong with with

248
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,920
uh with the way that we are Mobile today

249
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,639
and that has to change and indeed the

250
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,699
industry or those who are the the key

251
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,320
actors in terms of producing transport

252
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,860
is there to of course respond with some

253
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,899
solutions at least so we're being told

254
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,699
that at least one of the solutions or

255
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,260
one of the series of solutions that are

256
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,880
that are available are those of

257
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,800
platform-based economies of shared

258
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,459
digitalized smart Giga economy related

259
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,880
Mobility or mobilities so we for

260
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,180
instance in the future uh living in the

261
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,579
city we don't have to have a car as we

262
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,320
know detrimental to human environment we

263
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,199
can rent one through an app we can drive

264
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,759
electric cars which are readily

265
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,259
available in public space in our cities

266
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,880
we can use one of these electric

267
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,980
scooters and many other modes of

268
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,500
Transport that have boomed in recent

269
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,779
years in in many many cities of the

270
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,459
flogo north especially but also Global

271
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,220
South and Brussels uh I'm sure those of

272
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,199
you who are from the city who have been

273
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,119
there for a couple of months now

274
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,280
you know you can observe many of these

275
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,439
different practices of Mobility very

276
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
present in the city and some of them at

277
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,919
least

278
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,679
um being part of a narrative of of some

279
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,660
change of some future of something that

280
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,880
is shaping the way that we that we live

281
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,459
and move around the city

282
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,880
from a more scientific perspective one

283
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,340
answer why to the question why study

284
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,039
transport is that quite simply and this

285
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,720
is I think actually the very first

286
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,299
sentence of one of the most seminal uh

287
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,280
textbooks on German of Transport

288
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,559
geography there wouldn't be no

289
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,940
Transportation without geography and

290
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,260
there will be no Transportation no

291
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,660
church free without transportation and

292
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,240
transport of Transportation in North

293
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,500
America

294
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,179
um is an essentially geographical issue

295
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,700
the idea is and again it's the same

296
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,340
textbook the transport allows to reduce

297
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,080
the distance to zero of course that

298
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,120
reduction never really happens but the

299
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,039
idea is the transport allows to

300
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,320
manipulate space and time that is

301
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,740
required to to conquer to cover that

302
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,120
space

303
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,480
and I think beyond that very dry

304
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,520
definition of the relationship between

305
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,400
the two what's quite important is that

306
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,919
well it's very hard to imagine not only

307
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,620
contemporary but also

308
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,760
pre-modern ancient societies without

309
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,280
movement without without transport it's

310
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,539
it's something that has always been

311
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,520
fundamental for for human societies for

312
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,160
human settlements and today and that's

313
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,600
something that I will try to show you in

314
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,580
these two two lectures and in the

315
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,260
discussion that will follow the week

316
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,220
after

317
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,260
transport is absolutely fundamental for

318
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,760
for studying the city and I think it's a

319
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,039
fascinating entry for for studying what

320
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,919
cities are today with problems might be

321
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,960
found in the not only transport problems

322
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,520
but social problems facial problems

323
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,440
economic problems related to all

324
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,080
different challenges that at first at

325
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,120
least do not seem to be transport

326
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,460
related but in fact they are being

327
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,120
negotiated articulated contested soft

328
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,100
sometimes but more often unfortunately

329
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,440
created through transport through the

330
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,020
production and distribution of of

331
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,580
transport

332
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,320
so we will try to unpack this

333
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
relationship starting by uh let's say

334
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,880
more of a historical analysis so I'll

335
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,160
start in mid 19th century in cities in

336
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,740
western Europe uh in what we can

337
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,559
identify as a pre-industrial era

338
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,299
and we will bring that analysis to the

339
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:35,039
1960s 1970s let's see how much time

340
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,000
we've got uh for this today too uh well

341
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,100
let's say the beginning a major crisis

342
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,299
that formed or framed the debate in a

343
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,520
way that it is Being Framed still today

344
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,380
so some kind of a setting of a

345
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,559
contemporary challenge or series of

346
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,179
contemporary charity challenges related

347
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,280
to to transport and Mobility

348
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,559
all right

349
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,220
so

350
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,460
um

351
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,679
the main point here I don't want to

352
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,120
spend too much time on this historical

353
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,679
part because I don't think this is the

354
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,200
well it's it's not contemporary so

355
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,720
perhaps it's not as interesting as many

356
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,000
challenges that are happening right now

357
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,980
the main point here is that Urban

358
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,320
Transport Systems are are very strongly

359
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,299
and strictly related with Urban form and

360
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,280
with a spatial structure so the

361
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,840
development of cities is conditioned by

362
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,039
the development of what we call

363
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,400
transport modes from walking so just

364
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,860
walking on foot to the bicycle to public

365
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,100
transport and and to the car

366
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,720
and there is a persistently strong

367
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,820
relationship between the intra-urban

368
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,960
transportation system and the

369
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,640
organization of the Metropolis as

370
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,860
Mueller who wrote one of the most

371
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,860
seminal again textbooks on on the

372
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,960
history of Transport geography tells us

373
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,039
and there is a variety of different

374
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,080
Urban forms and spiritual structures and

375
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,820
land use patents which are related

376
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,880
specifically or very closely to the

377
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,980
development of different transport laws

378
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,559
and as far as I understand you've

379
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,720
covered quite a few of the most

380
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,080
important models of development Urban

381
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,880
Development throughout history with with

382
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,400
Nick you can not hear if that's the case

383
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,660
and or deny the fact that if you if you

384
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,400
didn't but I think that this was this

385
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,380
was covered at some point and the idea

386
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,919
here is that and a lot of these models

387
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,059
although not explicitly mentioned

388
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,559
transport was actually absolutely

389
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,740
crucial so the idea was both purchase

390
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,900
and announcer movement Mills mentioned

391
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,280
that without the development of

392
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,620
different ways of moving around the city

393
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,380
um the development which of course to an

394
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,299
extent erroneously they try to model or

395
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:44,179
predict would not be able to to happen

396
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,600
um well the debate has been there in the

397
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,120
in the in transport geography until the

398
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,260
1970s 1980s how to how to model that

399
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,720
relationship how to analyze it and

400
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,600
whether in fact it's it's more the

401
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,520
development of the city that drives the

402
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,900
development of transport of the other

403
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,280
Iran whether it's the development of

404
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,320
different transport modes that drive the

405
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,539
development of the city it's not a

406
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:10,620
particularly interesting debate today

407
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,419
but it's important to acknowledge that

408
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,880
geographers were very early on Urban

409
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
geographers interested in the

410
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,360
development of Mobility

411
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,600
one also rather imperfect and symbolic

412
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,880
rather than you know analytical way of

413
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,340
describing this is through identifying

414
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,200
some cycles of innovation so looking at

415
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,340
different

416
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,700
um scientific developments uh come uh

417
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,159
well some scientists would say in in

418
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,980
these kind of crucial moments and

419
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,120
there's a bundle of different

420
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,159
Innovations coming together so at the

421
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,200
end of the 19 18th century as you can

422
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,059
see at the left-hand side of the graph

423
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,299
and the invention of water power

424
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,299
textiles iron then some 60 70 years

425
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,940
later the steam engine rail production

426
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,720
of Steel etc etc each of these bundle of

427
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,000
Innovations allowing you to of course

428
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,820
create a more efficient that usually

429
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,860
meant faster and more energy efficient

430
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,799
way of moving uh of course not only

431
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,440
within but also between cities changing

432
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,299
not only the way that people move but

433
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,360
also the way that the city itself could

434
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,380
be could be organized in in space and in

435
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,539
this sense we could although of course

436
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,880
this is not a perfect you know robust

437
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,919
typology but we could

438
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,500
come into some kind of agreement you

439
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,360
don't have to accept it and I'm happy if

440
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,220
you if you raise some some issues with

441
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,440
it but we could divide the development

442
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,179
of the city around the development of

443
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,059
Transport by identifying four different

444
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,919
let's say stages I wouldn't call them

445
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,780
errors but a city that is a

446
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,880
pre-industrial city that largely was

447
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
based on walking uh since

448
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,640
um motorized transport was uh was

449
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,380
generally speaking not uh well it was

450
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,480
just not there and having a horse would

451
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,700
be an extremely expensive investment so

452
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,440
basically most people walked an

453
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,720
industrial city which uh developed

454
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,860
around

455
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,500
um the birth of what we could identify

456
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,980
today as public transport first horse

457
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,200
driven carts and then motorized ones

458
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,440
then the fordest city which very much

459
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,880
developed around the not only the

460
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,860
invention but rather domestification and

461
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,960
the panelization of of private vehicles

462
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,480
or private cars and then a city of today

463
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,980
the post Forest City which uh very much

464
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,940
Builds on the development of Transport

465
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,820
modes that use the ICT information and

466
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,919
information and communication

467
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,059
Technologies

468
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,220
and of course

469
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,159
um Aviation so the city does is very

470
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,080
much related also to the development of

471
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,299
of all the typology of spaces related to

472
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:46,500
to Flying to airplanes both passenger

473
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,620
and and cargo transport

474
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,179
are there any questions at this stage

475
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,100
before we dive into

476
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,860
these different four stages

477
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,520
I don't hear any yeah yeah go ahead

478
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,350
um

479
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,720
[Music]

480
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,820
it's linked to conductive

481
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,020
um because we saw something like that

482
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,000
with lessons of Nick

483
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,640
yeah I would say so I I think that it's

484
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,179
one of it's one of the ways of um

485
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,340
I wouldn't say that it's specific yeah

486
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,200
that it completely matches conductance

487
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,299
ways but the idea is the same uh that

488
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,520
there is some kind of development of uh

489
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,140
of innovation within the capitalist

490
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,240
system which allows to gain some

491
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,679
competitive Advantage which device

492
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,039
allows to create uh some kind of growth

493
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,659
machine and then this competitive

494
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,779
advantage over time is is uh is lost so

495
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,240
that we have a decline until it picks up

496
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,880
again what I think with chondratic is

497
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,980
still not clear is whether this new wave

498
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,779
so the one that here in this graph

499
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,480
happens after the 1990s it's very clear

500
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,760
so as far as I understand although I'm

501
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,559
not a specialist here there is a

502
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,720
discussion whether this new wave is with

503
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,299
the digitalization and software

504
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,220
engineering is actually materializing or

505
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,799
whether we've arrived at a global system

506
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,179
in which there is uh no growth of

507
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,100
um well at least within industrial

508
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,500
production it's rather a financial or

509
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,559
financialized growth

510
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,080
um but it's it's a good

511
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,360
um let's say it's a good hunch it's the

512
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,740
idea is more or less the same it's the

513
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,500
same intuition

514
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
also the problem with this clearly is

515
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,539
that it's not uh I mean this kind of way

516
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,400
of trying to understand what happened in

517
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,500
cities around transport in the past two

518
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,380
centuries is extremely Western uh

519
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,919
focused or very eurocentric

520
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,200
so so this would not be a story of of

521
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,100
cities in most of Latin America Africa

522
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,940
south Asia and also uh post Soviet or

523
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,580
Soviet world right so the global South

524
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,679
and the global east as it's sometimes

525
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,020
even called today it's not really part

526
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,159
of this

527
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,919
um well the story that is told by this

528
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,000
graph

529
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,580
um we will try to address this but um

530
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,880
it's yeah it's um that will happen at

531
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,440
the very end of the last of the last

532
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,840
session to try to decolonize a little

533
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,100
bit our knowledge about transport

534
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,480
geography because it's extremely

535
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,260
westernized and extremely eurocentric

536
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,740
right let's let's dive into that

537
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,880
um

538
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,020
right so the pre-industrial city right

539
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,260
um well I guess it's quite uh

540
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,100
self-explanatory it's not very difficult

541
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,080
to understand I mean the the idea is

542
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,940
that the city basically is

543
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,159
um well since there is no motorized

544
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,840
transport modes and

545
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,760
um having as I mentioned having a horse

546
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,039
or a horse car it's an it's a cost it's

547
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,440
a fortune it's an absolutely uh

548
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,380
luxurious good

549
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,240
pretty much everybody walks and since

550
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,360
everybody walks uh the city could not be

551
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,400
um cannot be too big for people to cross

552
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,059
it on foot with within more than 20 30

553
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,320
maybe 40 minutes so a traditional

554
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,059
Global northern European city would have

555
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,919
until

556
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,679
let's say end of the 18th century no

557
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,659
more than five kilometers in diameter

558
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,020
and that would mean of course here for

559
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,700
example you have a map of Brussels from

560
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,400
from that time that will mean that

561
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,620
within the city walls which existed for

562
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,960
for military purposes for defense

563
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,840
you know how to be a very high density

564
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,460
of of different functions of different

565
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,260
users

566
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,320
um and uh for other reasons that we're

567
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,179
not going to dive into today the great

568
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,520
Street pattern was also very common from

569
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,340
Middle Ages onwards also very

570
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,620
importantly since these well not maybe

571
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,480
since but as these different functions

572
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,880
were were mixed

573
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,799
um maybe this mixed city was allowed

574
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,419
partially also because of the fact that

575
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,159
the division between work at home a

576
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,440
division that is absolutely fundamental

577
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,419
for a lot of writing on transport

578
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,659
geography that focuses on that morning

579
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,120
and evening commute from home to work

580
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,919
and work from home that did not exist

581
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,740
most people worked from home most people

582
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,840
did not have to move

583
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,559
um to to reach we can say they employ

584
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,179
for the employment that they had or to

585
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:16,200
engage in some kind of productive

586
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,440
activity that would be renumerated to to

587
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,179
um gain some kind of salary or profit

588
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,880
things and this is all Brussels first

589
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,179
Brussels uh the map of it and then uh a

590
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,919
view of the of the city center where you

591
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,140
obviously well you basically see a lot

592
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,179
of pedestrians and uh not much else in

593
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,700
terms of in terms of Mobility modes this

594
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,159
began to change with a series of

595
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,980
inventions first a steam engine an

596
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,020
electric engine in both

597
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,799
um

598
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,020
well the invention started at the end of

599
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,840
18th century and and moved also to the

600
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,480
19th century then the bicycle

601
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,820
um I'm moving very fast here in time

602
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,960
when bicycle was invented in the

603
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,179
60s of the 19th century I think 1867

604
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,559
more or less

605
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,360
of course all these inventions first

606
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,419
being on Curiosities and again very

607
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,940
luxurious Goods bicycle being something

608
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,860
that was much more used for us as a form

609
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,200
of pleasure before eventually becoming a

610
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,340
mode of Transport for for many workers

611
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,020
all that it meant is that they gradually

612
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,940
uh led to mechanization of of land

613
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,340
Transport Systems

614
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,899
and

615
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:35,419
we see that gradually happening here so

616
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,039
these different inventions particularly

617
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,880
steam engine and nature also the

618
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,620
discovery and then Discovery information

619
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,220
that allow to produce electricity uh

620
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,039
meant that uh towards the end of the

621
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,899
19th century appears a completely

622
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,340
different amount of Transport which

623
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,679
revolutionized uh cities of the time

624
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,260
which is that of first a host drone

625
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,880
streetcar and then an electric street

626
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,240
car which started to be introduced in

627
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,700
European Western European cities around

628
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,820
1890s and then became extremely Popular

629
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,080
by the 1920s

630
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:15,659
that led to well we moved to this second

631
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,399
state let's say to the industrial city

632
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:20,460
led to a huge revolution of of how

633
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,340
cities could be conquered by its by its

634
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,840
inhabitants how they could be managed

635
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,940
navigated by by its inhabitants

636
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:30,539
um

637
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,659
that also allowed or led to the decision

638
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,580
to to engage in construction of a number

639
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,100
of underground uh tramways as they were

640
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,600
first called The Underground systems

641
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,460
first

642
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,460
uh in London and 18 as early as 1863

643
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,460
then Budapest in 1896 and the First

644
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,559
Northern American system in Boston in

645
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,200 1897.

646
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,360
and that that marked the beginning of of

647
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,059
as I said a revolutionary change in a

648
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,980
golden era of the development of Railway

649
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,980
Transport Systems as Railway networks

650
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,840
expanded tremendously and became the

651
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,220
dominant land transport for both

652
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,460
passengers and for Freight and that was

653
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,580
valid or is valid for both inter-urban

654
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,640
and intra intra-urban transport

655
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,620
why was this invention revolutionary

656
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,360
well of course because

657
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,399
increased speed allowed to cover

658
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,500
increased distance so suddenly the for

659
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,320
instance the idea of of still living

660
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,480
within the very medieval perimeter of

661
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,200
the city uh was or started to be to be

662
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,120
questioned the idea of expanding the

663
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,740
city to the suburb or connecting the

664
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,919
villages and the suburbs to the to the

665
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,620
city proper began to to make a lot of

666
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,779
sense so that led

667
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:43,500
um

668
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,200
was one at least one of the ideas why in

669
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,600
a number of uh cities across Europe City

670
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,059
walls where um were demolished

671
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,399
see that here in in Brussels so first uh

672
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,320
horse drawn card I think it's a

673
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,960
photograph from the 1890s

674
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,799
so end of the 19th century and

675
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,600
1910 uh I think it's a great Royal in

676
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,840
Brussels you already see and uh no I

677
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,559
think that's is that a horse

678
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,360
I think it actually is already it's an

679
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,620
electric one although I don't see the

680
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,120
cables I thought it was an electric but

681
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,220
I think it might still be

682
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,779
um pulled by a horse although you don't

683
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,779
see that from uh well the drum that is

684
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,279
heading in our direction does not have a

685
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,419
have a horse pulling it

686
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:33,539
right so

687
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,940
I already mentioned this in a little bit

688
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,779
so a revolution in urban travel a

689
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:43,380
breaking uh mode that's allowed to

690
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,600
um to rethink the air before made an

691
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,600
impact on it in a great way breaking

692
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,480
this idea of a compact dense medieval

693
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,480
city allowing to extend what we what was

694
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,059
considered to be a city to up to 20 or

695
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:58,679
30 kilometers in Diamond if you think

696
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,240
that the previous

697
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,820
um let's say model of a city had up to

698
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,820
five This was um

699
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,780
an expansion of four to six six times

700
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,379
what also appears in in this process uh

701
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:14,699
of course it's not all related to

702
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,080
transport but it's happening at more or

703
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,359
less the same time and it makes a big

704
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,879
impact on on what transport is in the

705
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,879
city and what a role is is that this

706
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,560
expansion of the urban form in space

707
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,480
allows for some specialization of

708
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,159
different functions especially economic

709
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,219
functions and what it also creates or

710
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,199
contributes to the creation of is the

711
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,599
creation of a working class of of a

712
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,480
specific group a social group of course

713
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,139
Very diverse internally but a group that

714
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,980
um sells its time for a living that uh

715
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,418
of course with the Industrial Revolution

716
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,760
does that not anymore at home but

717
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,399
actually starts what we start calling

718
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,040
commuting to its uh to its workplace

719
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,040
where

720
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,320
things are being produced what profit is

721
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,119
being made and where their salary

722
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,260
workers is exchanged uh for uh for money

723
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,240
for a salary

724
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,040
um that separation as I mentioned being

725
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,220
absolutely fundamental for decades of of

726
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,859
analysis of transport to to come so

727
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,500
focus on this commute from from work to

728
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,500
home and vice versa

729
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,680
moving to the next some technical issues

730
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,740
here moving to the next uh stage of

731
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,839
Urban Development we can put it very

732
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,020
very roughly of course a fundamental

733
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,359
invention of of the car not only the

734
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:38,820
invention of the car proper because the

735
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,760
well the vehicle itself I mean we can go

736
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,040
back to the first the diesel engine

737
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,500
invented in the 90s of the 19th century

738
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,480
pneumatic tire four-stroke engine

739
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,780
invented a few years later and that led

740
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,820
to the construction of the first

741
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,380
automobiles as they were called back

742
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,260
then in 1890s

743
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,660
um but it was fundamentally the

744
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,640
massification of of the current the

745
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,220
invention of this particular model uh

746
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,780
which I'm sure you've

747
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,460
or a lot of you probably have heard

748
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,099
about already the Model T by Ford uh

749
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,980
which began to be produced in 1913 and

750
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,980
famously Mr Ford said that this model is

751
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,380
available in any color as long as it is

752
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,780
black the idea being that with

753
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,720
unification of

754
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,460
universalization of the model uh getting

755
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,180
rid of any options of any customization

756
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,240
of any personalization

757
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,240
um and also the implementation of today

758
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,339
is being called taylorism so reaching a

759
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:43,440
near automated way of producing this

760
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,660
this vehicle with very strictly measured

761
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,380
time for every single activity that

762
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,640
that was part of the production process

763
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,400
the final price of the production and

764
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,320
the final price for the consumer could

765
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,240
be reduced as much as possible meaning

766
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,240
that this product this commodity could

767
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,900
be available to to White masses and that

768
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,500
does begin uh from the 1910s already but

769
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,380
especially from the 1930s uh when indeed

770
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,540
the price started going significantly

771
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,300
down the era of of the automobile the

772
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,359
era of a mode which I'm sure that if you

773
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,280
you know turn on the news about Brussels

774
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,140
or any other Western European North

775
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,680
American city uh by that debate also uh

776
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,599
is very very present in many African

777
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,540
Latin American South Asian cities

778
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,940
um it's a mode that is very much on the

779
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,980
agenda whenever you talk about whenever

780
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,140
you hear about transport

781
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,660
and we're going to talk about that I

782
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,520
guess tonight if not in a week as a very

783
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,020
uh well as a very present mode of

784
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,460
Transport in our cities and also very

785
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,839
problematic mode of Transport that

786
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,940
attracts a lot of condensation a lot of

787
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,020
uh

788
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,359
um a lot of anger and a lot of

789
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,280
um creative and critical thinking in

790
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,660
terms of what's the alternative to the

791
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,040
to the automobile

792
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,020
so it's been almost a century now that

793
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,480
our cities if we think about it from the

794
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,000
global North uh I don't know benefiting

795
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,040
or suffering from that from that no you

796
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,599
tell me

797
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,380
um

798
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,940
famously from 1913 to 1927 Ford managed

799
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,520
to build 15 million units 15 million

800
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,560
Vehicles making it the second most

801
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,240
produced car in history right after

802
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,220
Volkswagen Beetle

803
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,740
um which was also they began the

804
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,240
production a little bit later but also

805
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,220
in the period between the first and

806
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,800
second World War

807
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,800
so why uh well this we've covered

808
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,859
already mostly but well the most

809
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,780
important thing here is in the last

810
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,140
bullet points I mean why is the car such

811
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,640
a revolutionary and such an important

812
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,380
mode of transports to be to be mentioned

813
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,300
here is that for the very first time

814
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,160
Mobility

815
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,440
um modernized Mobility is an individual

816
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,920
exercise it's no longer only a motorized

817
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,440
or a horse horse-drone streetcar that

818
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,200
allows you to cover long distances of

819
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,720
taking a train a Suburban train that

820
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,220
takes you to the factory and back but

821
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,740
it's an it is an individual vehicle an

822
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,420
individual product that allows you to

823
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,540
reach unprecedented levels of of

824
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,460
individual Mobility

825
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,599
and of course that uh immediately uh had

826
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,300
a very important impact on on the way

827
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,859
that the cities are planned and and

828
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:25,859
imagined

829
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,320
um

830
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,079
well

831
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,900
without running the risk of uh or maybe

832
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,060
a little bit of you know drawing some

833
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,060
kind of caricature this impact

834
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,980
um starting from especially the second

835
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,520
world war when when it was a very strong

836
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,619
Narrative of the need of modernizing

837
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:48,240
um cities especially in North America

838
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,160
and Western Europe

839
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,940
a lot of cities be became basically

840
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,320
um

841
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,780
well perfect space for for for for

842
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,200
driving around a space in which huge

843
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,780
amounts of infrastructure for this

844
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,119
individual car based Mobility was built

845
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,220
this process started a little bit early

846
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,980
in the US and the 1940s and 50s already

847
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,260
and after the second world war

848
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,060
um that narrative was started to be very

849
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,460
present in in Western European as 50

850
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,260
both of these images by the way come

851
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,200
from a really wonderful film by uh

852
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,060
Jacques tatti I believe it's called

853
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,579
playtime from the 1967 which I really

854
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:27,900
recommend you watch it's a great

855
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,599
critique of this idea of this training

856
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,180
of modernity which also very much hinges

857
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,480
on on the idea of having a car of um

858
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,240
of driving around

859
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,900
um and well moving to more serious stuff

860
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,480
I mean accommodating the current city

861
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,240
meant that

862
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,619
serious infrastructure had to be built

863
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,960
uh series have had to happen in in

864
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,140
cities at the time for for the car to

865
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,720
receive this kind of space

866
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,500
um

867
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,839
some of the most important projects

868
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:02,579
happen in the US as I mentioned on the

869
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,020
on the left hand side you've got the

870
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,480
Franklin Delano Roosevelt drive and

871
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,240
opened in 1966 in New York on the right

872
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,820
hand side the infamous Ponte Morandi in

873
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,859
in Genoa in Italy 1967 which

874
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,740
unfortunately collapsed I believe two

875
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,280
years ago which also symbolized of

876
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,020
course it's a it's a terrible terrible

877
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,140
event but for for many it was a very

878
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,180
powerful symbol of this infrastructure

879
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,760
crumbling and an important question of

880
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,820
what to do with these relics of

881
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,820
um of modernity or past modernity

882
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,099
whether they should be in this case

883
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:41,220
rebuilt or maintained or invested in

884
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,839
whether this is something that we want

885
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:45,540
to gradually dismantle uh and and stop

886
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,460
subsidizing the maintenance of these

887
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,700
infrastructures is um undoubtedly very

888
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,440
costly

889
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,920
and the next slide uh does anybody have

890
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,380
a clue where this city is

891
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,780
very good well done yes this is the uh

892
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,339
I don't remember the name of the road

893
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,980
but uh yeah yeah it's in the next slide

894
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,800
I'm so silly green belch are nine built

895
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,140
in 90 or opened in 1976. I don't know if

896
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,060
you've ever had the experience of of

897
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,460
driving this but it's really uh it's

898
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,800
uncanny it's it it makes me personally

899
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,099
feel as if I was in some uh Chinese or

900
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,260
other Asian City where you're on this

901
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,200
elevated platform almost gliding through

902
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,119
through the city so it's really one of

903
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,200
the

904
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,540
uh I think most extreme or more extreme

905
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,280
cases at least in this part of of Europe

906
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,660
of

907
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,060
um really plowing through through a city

908
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,140
to build this Motorway uh Ring Road

909
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,380
but chalawa was not the only one I mean

910
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,780
we are after all or I don't know where

911
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,460
you are right now but most of us are in

912
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,020
Brussels right now and Brussels was

913
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,720
definitely also a playground for many of

914
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,180
these many of these ideas and the idea

915
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,740
of bringing the car and opening the city

916
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,880
to the car

917
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,980
like in American cities at least that

918
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,720
was the comparison used in Belgium

919
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,880
became particularly strong and

920
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,099
particularly

921
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,740
um potent among the political class the

922
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,680
decision makers around 1958. what

923
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,560
happened in 1958 I guess you've heard

924
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,480
that date before

925
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,579
any non-belgians

926
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:28,220
1958 why is that important for Brussels

927
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,560
the atomium and why would the atomium be

928
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,680
uh well okay the World Expo symbolized

929
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,000
by the atomium and why would that be

930
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,839
related to the car

931
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,099
um you really don't have any ideas

932
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:50,099
I mean if you opening a World Expo for

933
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,480
the very first time in Belgium and

934
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,220
inviting I don't remember how many

935
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,140
people actually visited the Expo in the

936
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,180
end but millions of people uh visited

937
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,119
the city why why would a car be

938
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,980
important of the car be important in

939
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,520
that regard

940
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,339
so for putting Belgium on the map

941
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,319
yes it's to solve the idea of I mean not

942
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,359
the idea the problem of congestion is to

943
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,280
bring these masses to the Expo and back

944
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,380
is to allow for a better communication

945
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,540
but also to put Belgium on them to show

946
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,700
that Belgium is a modern country to show

947
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,760
that it's it's on you know Cutting Edge

948
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,980
and being Cutting Edge in 1958 and those

949
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,960
who meant opening the city for the car

950
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,800
and

951
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,680
building huge infrastructure or start at

952
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,300
least to build huge infrastructure that

953
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,079
would accommodate this new modern uh us

954
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,579
like

955
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:51,240
um American way of of mobility of moving

956
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,220
around the city

957
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:58,020
uh so yeah uh some things that are quite

958
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,540
quite Unthinkable today uh were going on

959
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,599
at that time so this is Gohan plus uh I

960
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,819
think it's in the 1960s

961
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:08,940
so of course Expo was a symbolic event

962
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,700
it didn't really uh I mean it was it was

963
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,880
not just tipping points there were a lot

964
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,500
of Dynamics happening at that time and

965
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,900
the Expo was maybe a more of a symbolic

966
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,180
moment but it is around the time that

967
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,460
the level of motorization so the level

968
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,920
of ownership of cars in Belgian

969
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,380
households and similar processes are

970
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,640
mentioned in Belgium here but similar

971
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,960
things were going on in France in

972
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,920
Germany

973
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,880
uh in the UK it went through the roof

974
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,880
um so it was

975
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,640
it was very very common back then to uh

976
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,920
to invest in a car as a symbol of of

977
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,960
advancing as a household as a symbol of

978
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,720
social Mobility not only a physical uh

979
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,160
geographical Mobility that of course

980
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,260
meant that more and more space had to be

981
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,240
given to the car and as the car became

982
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,740
more present more people bought the car

983
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,140
so the circle was closed and it was a

984
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,700
vicious one

985
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,400
in Brussels specifically well one of the

986
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,200
most important infrastructures built at

987
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,599
the time is the Petit Center so the Ring

988
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,660
Road that surrounds the Pentagon of the

989
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,520
city I'm sure that you've all have been

990
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,240
there so essentially the

991
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,500
well the the framing of it right the the

992
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,000
actual shape of the Pentagon comes from

993
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,800
the city was the second walls of

994
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,079
Brussels uh coming from the 14th century

995
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,300
uh completely destroyed which defined

996
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,800
the historic center of the city still

997
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,560
and until the 1950s it was a very much

998
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,180
an urban Boulevard in which one could

999
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,520
stroll and and walk very much like in

1000
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,180
the

1001
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,920
drawings rather than photographs that I

1002
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,900
showed you at the beginning from this

1003
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,940
city of walking city that was very much

1004
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,520
defined by by The Pedestrian mode of

1005
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,180
moving around

1006
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,099
um and in relation to the 1958 that had

1007
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,220
to be gradually uh transformed so a

1008
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,980
series of first tunnels were built then

1009
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,859
uh the service was raised to uh to open

1010
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:01,020
to the car it took 20 years of work

1011
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,760
which is not a very unusual thing in

1012
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,740
Brussels uh to do so two decades of

1013
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,900
extremely heavy work uh and very

1014
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,400
destructive work whole neighborhoods

1015
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,680
have to be relocated destroyed to

1016
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,060
rebuilt

1017
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,780
um so opened in 1976 uh with 15 tunnels

1018
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,060
surrounding the city also quite

1019
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,640
importantly and that's maybe a bit of an

1020
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,380
extreme story that not necessarily

1021
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,480
happened also in France or in Germany or

1022
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,460
in other Western European cities but

1023
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,920
what was very crucial in Brussels is

1024
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,020
that the engineering teams or the

1025
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,000
engineering offices consultancy officers

1026
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,460
who would call them today would receive

1027
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,380
a personal bonus on top of their salary

1028
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,480
for every kilo kilometer of an

1029
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,720
underground tunnel built so that led to

1030
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,480
creation of a huge push to build

1031
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,300
underground infrastructure for Mobility

1032
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,119
both for for cars but also for railroad

1033
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,119
and Metro uh and that led to a creation

1034
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:56,099
of very important expertise in building

1035
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:58,260
these underground tunnels uh which of

1036
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,660
course once you have that expertise you

1037
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,400
of course want to keep building more

1038
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,500
because that's what you are very good at

1039
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,500
doing and that problem in Brussels well

1040
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,020
problem of situation exists until today

1041
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,099
where we have huge teams of engineering

1042
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,119
Specialists who specialize in building

1043
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,339
underground it's in steep in the public

1044
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:19,380
transport company in Brussels half of

1045
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,780
the company is responsible for for Metro

1046
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,599
for maintenance and construction so you

1047
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,220
can imagine that what you want to do of

1048
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,260
course is to keep building and Metro

1049
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,000
which is what they are currently doing

1050
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,160
in Brussels

1051
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,200
um moving a little bit or zooming out a

1052
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,960
little bit from cities

1053
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,720
um the large-scale diffusion of of the

1054
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,099
car or the automobile is a mass

1055
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,460
consumption project of course was uh

1056
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,560
strongly also influenced or maybe also

1057
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,440
LED so it's a two-way Dynamic to the

1058
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,260
emergence of first Nationwide Highway

1059
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,260
systems in the first one uh created was

1060
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,540
of course the one in the US the American

1061
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,000
interstate highway system which began to

1062
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,980
be not maybe completely built from

1063
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,880
scratch but the first framing of it and

1064
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,920
continuous gradual addition to the

1065
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,579
network in 1956.

1066
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,700
um which was of course back then uh that

1067
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,859
symbol of modernity that

1068
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,800
um in many many places in Belgium being

1069
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,560
one of them influence the definition of

1070
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,300
the idea of what was Modern what was

1071
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,160
cutting-edge was technologically

1072
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,800
advanced

1073
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,400
today of course uh it's not the us

1074
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,800
anymore that it's the leading uh country

1075
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,420
or the leading power in terms of the

1076
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,220
development of Transport technology and

1077
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,740
and highways in particular uh that

1078
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,140
system that American system has been by

1079
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,319
now surpassed definitely by the one in

1080
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,540
China the national trunk highway system

1081
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,280
here I have a little bit of an old graph

1082
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,540
but by 2011 as far as I can read it well

1083
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,720
but already 2009 the total amount of

1084
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,339
kilometers of motorways in both

1085
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:02,520
countries us and China was equal and the

1086
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,440
one in China of course was Rising still

1087
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,579
very

1088
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:08,880
um very steep but you can see that this

1089
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,640
I don't like the term but let's say the

1090
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,460
catching up or this idea of following a

1091
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,079
little bit in the footsteps of what the

1092
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,119
Americans did in the 1950s in China

1093
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,339
happened in an extremely

1094
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:23,700
um short time which not only because of

1095
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,200
the construction of the motorways but

1096
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,839
this was a very important part of the of

1097
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,900
the construction boom meant that

1098
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,680
um

1099
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,880
from 2006 2007 onwards now the situation

1100
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,200
is a little bit different because of the

1101
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,000
ongoing crisis and also other problems

1102
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,819
the Chinese economy uh suffered from but

1103
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:44,520
the consumption of the the demand for

1104
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,800
concrete in China was bigger than in all

1105
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,760
other countries around the world

1106
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,000
combined so this was really a boom of an

1107
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,540
unprecedented scale and we will see a

1108
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,280
few other graphs and down the lecture

1109
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,660
which

1110
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:01,440
show us that while in many cities many

1111
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,819
countries around what we might be

1112
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,559
thinking that we are moving away from

1113
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,660
the current right now but that's the

1114
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,240
idea that the other parts of the world

1115
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,280
that did not experience this development

1116
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,740
at the same time as Global noise are now

1117
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:18,059
and definitely contributing to um to not

1118
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:19,680
even I would say Persistence of

1119
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,819
automobility but actually it's

1120
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:23,780
continuous rise on the global scale

1121
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,040
what was very important going back to

1122
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,160
the Belgium uh context of the 1950s and

1123
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,400
1960s it's also difficult to say what

1124
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,579
was first the car or the suburbs or the

1125
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:37,260
suburbs and the car but the two were

1126
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,020
extremely uh strongly linked with one

1127
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,839
another having the car

1128
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,720
and as I mentioned as I explained the

1129
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,760
car became a very common popular and

1130
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,579
cheap commodity not only defined how we

1131
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,680
moved to to uh to work and you move

1132
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,420
around the city but actually it's again

1133
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,880
redefined what the city is so suddenly

1134
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,220
areas which would be normally considered

1135
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,460
rural become accessible and become

1136
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,440
interesting for people to to settle in

1137
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,260
the idea also being and that you have

1138
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,680
more space more freedom

1139
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,599
you are close to you are close to Nature

1140
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,780
etc etc these days it might be it might

1141
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,460
feel like it's something of the past

1142
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,700
something that is uh yeah not

1143
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,099
interesting to to many urbanites of

1144
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,740
today day but back then it was

1145
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,720
absolutely the way to the way to go the

1146
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,720
way to live the way to think uh that one

1147
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,680
should invest as a household in

1148
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,579
the home Marketing in property Market

1149
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:39,300
um

1150
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,650
the special

1151
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,020
[Music]

1152
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,900
results of of that of the double Dynamic

1153
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,480
of motorization on the one hand

1154
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,359
suborganization on the other was that if

1155
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,760
a pre-industrial city had more or less

1156
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,599
10 of its space devoted to transport and

1157
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,859
Mobility an industrial a modern city has

1158
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:04,260
between 15 and 30 percent and that's

1159
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,119
rough estimates from Western Europe to

1160
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:08,400
up to 60 percent in in some American

1161
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,420
cities of space will be given to uh to

1162
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,980
Mobility infrastructure which is

1163
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,280
principally uh highways and and parking

1164
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,000
lots which of course uh is a is a huge

1165
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
spatial cost

1166
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,700
and uh well another development of

1167
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,160
course is that uh the commuting area as

1168
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,000
we we start to call it so the the actual

1169
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,079
um

1170
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,240
definition of what a city is regardless

1171
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,040
of administrative limits and different

1172
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,540
boundaries of course this would be often

1173
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,400
divided into some municipalities and all

1174
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,000
it goes up to uh 100 kilometers in

1175
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,460
diameter so suddenly what is a city

1176
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,900
becomes

1177
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,359
um or starts becoming a little bit vague

1178
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,700
in the sense that the old Urban course

1179
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,640
of course do not hold all the functions

1180
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,180
anymore and we start seeing cities

1181
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,760
um expanding in this economic uh

1182
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,760
economic terms

1183
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,760
well

1184
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,540
without running into the risk of of

1185
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,400
simplifying things a little bit too much

1186
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,760
but what happened in a lot of cities

1187
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,200
both in North America and in Western

1188
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,780
Europe is that as the car became more

1189
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,300
and more popular and as moving by car

1190
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,819
became absolutely common

1191
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:28,740
um and if you basically had a middle

1192
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,140
class job and that's that's what you did

1193
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,280
you lived in the suburbs and you

1194
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,660
commuted to the office job by car

1195
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,579
Transit companies or mass transit

1196
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:39,839
companies public transport companies

1197
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,880
started to run into serious financial

1198
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,220
difficulties so

1199
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,319
um traditionally uh when they were

1200
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,260
actually set up in the 19th or end of

1201
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,599
the 19th century 1910s 1920s they would

1202
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,220
be private companies very often private

1203
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,200
arailroads bringing workers to the

1204
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,059
suburbs and dark or bringing the

1205
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:00,300
Bourgeois and people who wanted to enjoy

1206
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,040
Leisure outside of the city and then

1207
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:02,940
back

1208
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,760
as they started to run into trouble in

1209
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,400
some countries and that's usually the

1210
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,599
case in Western Europe they would be

1211
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,099
nationalized they will be taken over by

1212
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,200
the state as an important part of

1213
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,619
military infrastructure but also an

1214
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:17,460
important part of Mobility

1215
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,579
infrastructure and kept but they roll

1216
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:22,260
the societal role would definitely

1217
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,940
decline so it would be it would become

1218
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,339
something not necessarily for the middle

1219
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:28,619
class but rather for the working class

1220
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:31,380
Belgium here is some sort of an

1221
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,319
exception because a lot of commuting

1222
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:35,940
here and due to the fact that the

1223
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,220
railway system was traditionally been

1224
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,680
very dense

1225
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,180
hadn't happened and still is happening

1226
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,920
uh very much through public transport

1227
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,420
but that's definitely not the case in

1228
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,339
the UK for example or definitely not in

1229
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:48,300
North America

1230
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,079
but and sticking to North America

1231
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,020
um in a number of uh cities over there

1232
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,720
the process that happened uh was

1233
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,220
inversed so the decline of public

1234
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,319
transit did not lead to any uh

1235
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:03,119
investment by the state either on the

1236
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,420
federal or the state state level uh but

1237
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,500
rather

1238
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,280
um

1239
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,740
eventually a dismantling of of public

1240
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,579
transport systems happened and a very uh

1241
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,200
particular story is that of the General

1242
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,300
Motors Company so one of the main

1243
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,579
producers of of these Mass Commodities

1244
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,740
the cars

1245
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,140
um who throughout the 1940s basically

1246
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,059
bought a number of public transport

1247
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,740
companies mass transit companies as they

1248
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,780
are called over there and purposely led

1249
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,440
to the decline uh why well the idea was

1250
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,240
quite simple and it was basically to get

1251
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,619
rid of the competitions that public

1252
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:38,760
transport

1253
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,960
um could have

1254
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,240
um could have posed to the to the

1255
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,760
individual Mobility to to the car so the

1256
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,740
idea was to push public transport out of

1257
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,319
the market and again

1258
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:50,359
um

1259
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:53,780
I just saw the comment from somebody

1260
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,359
and and again yes the idea of course was

1261
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,160
that this was also framed by the

1262
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,099
discourse of modernity and and advancing

1263
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:03,839
as a society

1264
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,400
um I forgot to mention but we will be

1265
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,980
taking uh a break in both today and then

1266
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,960
a week uh I don't think that you know

1267
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,520
sticking to the screen for two hours is

1268
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,740
a healthy thing to do so we will take a

1269
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,940
break actually in three minutes probably

1270
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,619
for about five minutes

1271
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:18,660
uh just in case you're getting a little

1272
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,020
bit tight

1273
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:26,640
but this uh total decline or some could

1274
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,140
even say a disaster in terms of what

1275
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,180
happened to mass transport must transits

1276
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,760
or in public transport was not uh always

1277
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,220
the case so as I already mentioned in in

1278
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,319
some countries uh public transport

1279
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,359
networks are actually what being taken

1280
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,040
over by the state and even invested in

1281
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,200
and one important thing that happens or

1282
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,839
you know a symbolic project that

1283
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,700
happened is that of copenhagen's finger

1284
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,819
plant from 1947 uh so basically their

1285
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:52,859
the decision was made to create an

1286
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:55,079
alternative or maybe not a substitute

1287
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:56,940
but an alternative parallel to car

1288
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,520
commuting basically Suburban rail which

1289
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,900
follows the shape of five fingers uh

1290
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,920
corridors that would not only be

1291
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,619
transport corridors but also along which

1292
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,599
a number of different functions

1293
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,480
especially residential but also economic

1294
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,839
work related functions would be

1295
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,900
um placed as well and that was uh as far

1296
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,839
as I know one of the first plans that uh

1297
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,819
tried to achieve what we call transport

1298
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:25,680
oriented development or development

1299
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,440
Urban Development that happens around or

1300
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,480
in this particular case a long transport

1301
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,359
corridors to allow for different

1302
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,180
Mobility options back then maybe

1303
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,260
environmental issues were not so much on

1304
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,760
the agenda but the idea was that people

1305
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,380
would be able to get more efficiently to

1306
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,480
work not only by car but also by

1307
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,599
Suburban rail

1308
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,200
uh in our lovely Brussels well things

1309
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,819
were not so

1310
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,099
not so easy or well things were a little

1311
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:55,380
bit in between so on the one hand the

1312
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,180
car was definitely the king and actually

1313
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,720
it's one of the uh slogans in in

1314
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,880
let's say Brussels centered Academia and

1315
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,400
public debate Carr became the King

1316
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,559
around the 1950s with the Expo of the

1317
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:09,960
1958 and still very much is a very

1318
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,460
present and very privileged mode of

1319
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,839
transport

1320
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:14,460
but public transport of course did not

1321
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,960
disappear and one of the particularities

1322
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,000
of Brussels is that unlike in Charlotte

1323
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,079
for example or many cities in Germany or

1324
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,880
in France especially tramways for

1325
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,799
example were never completely dismantled

1326
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:29,819
and you would see and I can't think of

1327
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:31,380
any specific names right now in France

1328
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,900
but there are cities in which tranway

1329
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,440
network existed uh 1940s 50s and 60s and

1330
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,220
then was completely dismantled to open a

1331
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,859
surface space to the car so what

1332
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:45,660
happened in Brussels is that the Trump

1333
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,480
was basically put underground so you see

1334
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,720
on top left

1335
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,819
which is that magnificent Urban Waterway

1336
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:56,819
these days and you see a tram trying to

1337
00:59:56,819 --> 00:59:58,980
plow its way through the through the

1338
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,740
city standing in a traffic jam the idea

1339
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,200
uh well of course the city is packed the

1340
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,819
space is limited with the rise of

1341
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:08,940
mobility and individual mobility and the

1342
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,040
rise of the number of cars traffic jams

1343
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,200
happen the decision there was May need

1344
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,700
not to make more space for the tram

1345
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,260
would make to make more space for the

1346
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,380
car so strategic decision was to put the

1347
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,559
tram first on the ground creating a very

1348
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,780
particular mode of transports made in

1349
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,940
Brussels called pre-metro premature

1350
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,099
which then eventually

1351
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:31,020
um as it was actually planned was

1352
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,619
converted into into a full-scale as we

1353
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:37,200
call it in Brussels heavy metal look you

1354
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,000
can actually see in pre-metro still and

1355
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,680
that's line three and four in in

1356
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,299
Brussels the tramline that goes from

1357
01:00:42,299 --> 01:00:44,700
north to south of the Pentagon which as

1358
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,140
you probably have heard

1359
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,319
is now well will soon be converted into

1360
01:00:49,319 --> 01:00:51,780
a proper Network once and the new metro

1361
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,839
line from God you know and northwards is

1362
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:56,880
constructed uh so you can for example

1363
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,040
see I don't know if you ever had a

1364
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,260
chance of of uh you know noting that the

1365
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,819
platforms and although this is a trump

1366
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:04,140
stock the platforms are actually much

1367
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,299
much wider than usually would be in the

1368
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:08,520
case of a tram and they are much longer

1369
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,680
basically they were built I think

1370
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,319
already back in the 70s anticipating a

1371
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:16,020
proper Metro we are now in 2020 so

1372
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,000
finally the Metro is is happening

1373
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,740
although well it's a controversial

1374
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,559
project to say the least

1375
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,500
um let's take a little break here not

1376
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,500
longer than five six minutes so grab

1377
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,440
another tea or a coffee and I'll see you

1378
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,839
back in four or five minutes all right

1379
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,400
great

1380
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,420
see you in a moment

1381
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,700
welcome back overview I hope you grabbed

1382
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,980
another drink or whatever it is that you

1383
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,619
are having or grab another notebook to

1384
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:48,180
keep noticing things although of course

1385
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,579
you've got the recording of all this

1386
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:52,319
um and I can see that some people are

1387
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,420
asking questions

1388
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:58,859
um I might also ask you if up to now up

1389
01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:00,480
to now everything has been clear or if

1390
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,160
you've got any questions about what I've

1391
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,500
been talking about if yes please raise

1392
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,660
your hand just speak up but I think it's

1393
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,299
an interesting question that Mika asked

1394
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:12,480
here in the chat with um

1395
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,640
indeed what was happening right now is

1396
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,579
that we have an increased desire for

1397
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:19,980
uh what we could say is a pre-industrial

1398
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,319
city a city of walking of uh short of

1399
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:26,160
distances density of users mixes

1400
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,319
um does anybody have an opinion on this

1401
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:32,900
would you agree would you not agree

1402
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:39,780
or maybe Mika whoever he or she is has

1403
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,099
an opinion

1404
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,420
that's me

1405
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,559
um

1406
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,859
yeah I wasn't sure if it's really linked

1407
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:49,559
to the pre-industrial city but when you

1408
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:51,119
explained

1409
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:52,619
um

1410
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:55,980
how how it was looking how how it looked

1411
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,680
like I thought about like actually it's

1412
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,660
exactly what today's planning is about

1413
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,980
like this

1414
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:05,039
uh mixed use this like

1415
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,059
a narrow uh streets where you yeah with

1416
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:14,220
walkability and short distances and I

1417
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,560
mean maybe it's also really a European

1418
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,339
perspective

1419
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:24,420
maybe it could be like a new role model

1420
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,080
of today's planning does anybody have an

1421
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,420
uh an opinion on this would anybody like

1422
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,900
to react

1423
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:41,520
I can compare with for example in

1424
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,140
interrupt

1425
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:43,720
um I'm living

1426
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,460
[Music]

1427
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,120
um

1428
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,238
in the center of the city and

1429
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:52,439
what we see is uh that the place for

1430
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:55,259
um private cars is reducing for example

1431
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:57,960
they they put parking lots under

1432
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,660
undergrounds for making some some

1433
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,120
leisure activities or Parks or something

1434
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,120
else so we see a movement I guess when

1435
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,179
we focus on that and definitely in

1436
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:12,120
Brussels depending on the policy now

1437
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,779
um it's more ecological

1438
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:18,540
minded and we see more

1439
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,960
um opportunities to to reduce

1440
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,420
parking lots and and more movements like

1441
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,960
for example in unspec land yeah

1442
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,060
um

1443
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:31,679
so this pedestrian area of Brussels yeah

1444
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,960
yeah and we couldn't imagine I guess 20

1445
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,460
years ago so we see different movements

1446
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:39,600
yeah there is definitely some kind of

1447
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,020
shift happening I mean we are not in the

1448
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:45,179
1960s or 70s not where like what is

1449
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:47,580
right now on the slide things have moved

1450
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,380
on the present of the car is definitely

1451
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,540
put on the question but is this about

1452
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,120
going to a free industrial city what

1453
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,500
would be the problem with that or would

1454
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,540
be the risk of

1455
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:00,120
um just reverting to walking let's say

1456
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,160
if that's what the pre-industrial city

1457
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,320
was about

1458
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,320
does anybody have you know an opinion on

1459
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,219
this

1460
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:12,000
there is no wrong answers here

1461
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,860
Vitality is saying that new Mobility

1462
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,960
plans are aiming at the best of use of

1463
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,040
all Technologies we have now with

1464
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,900
maximum inclusivity

1465
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,840
yeah I guess so

1466
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,840
um the proof is in the in the you know

1467
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,120
well depends on how they of course

1468
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,520
implement it and and it's the idea of

1469
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,199
course is that everybody is included and

1470
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,080
we use all the Technologies we have

1471
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,400
in practice we will see that it's a

1472
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,960
little bit complicated

1473
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,080
um

1474
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,760
maybe it's also the like when we were

1475
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,040
looking at the Metro System that it's

1476
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,340
more about underground transportation

1477
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:51,440
so like separation okay

1478
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,780
transportation systems mm-hmm somebody

1479
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:58,320
somebody else started uh talking who was

1480
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,840
that yeah that was me and also

1481
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,100
also what I wanted to bring up was the

1482
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,880
where industry

1483
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,739
industry or small businesses are still

1484
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:10,080
located and where people can have you

1485
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,040
know

1486
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,980
um can find jobs almost in their in

1487
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,900
their neighborhood that it it you know

1488
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,420
especially maybe jobs that don't

1489
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:20,699
necessarily pay so well that wouldn't be

1490
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:22,679
interesting for other people to to

1491
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:25,020
commute into the city too and I think

1492
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,360
these kind of businesses are a bit under

1493
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,940
pressure from the reduction in space

1494
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,280
that they have on you know to to

1495
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,980
organize these productive activities so

1496
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:38,940
I think yeah space in front of there in

1497
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,040
front of the street to to actually do

1498
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,080
their deliveries and I think there's

1499
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,860
attention there in the kind of city

1500
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,600
um you want and the way you want the

1501
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,159
service different neighborhoods and

1502
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,480
different

1503
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,880
um different areas so one of the cases

1504
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,780
was like um these smaller construction

1505
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,500
um supplies kind of stores maybe in the

1506
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,840
area of lack and like not far from the

1507
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,120
canal you know serving a kind of a

1508
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,480
secondary places where you know you just

1509
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,940
wouldn't go to Bricco for those kind of

1510
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,739
um materials you would go to your

1511
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:15,719
neighborhood and that's that's becoming

1512
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:18,540
harder with uh you know to to maintain

1513
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,239
in a in an urban environment that gives

1514
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:24,719
more space to walking and to to to to

1515
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,179
um yeah to bike lanes and so on so

1516
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:28,679
that's on the one side it doesn't mean

1517
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,780
that I agree but it's I think one of the

1518
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:34,320
one of the pressures that is being

1519
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,320
um this is being felt by by that by that

1520
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,060
group I mean I guess what's what's

1521
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,100
important what you said and to relate it

1522
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,420
also to what I was talking about before

1523
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,860
and what we tell you there is the

1524
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,480
writing is that there is some with each

1525
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,940
of these technological shifts of course

1526
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,380
they are very

1527
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,960
um I mean it's a very broad sketch these

1528
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,480
things were not happening in in sudden

1529
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,360
turns it's a it's a process but the

1530
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,940
space is valorized in different ways and

1531
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,739
for example if we see here in this slide

1532
01:13:01,739 --> 01:13:03,600
as I mentioned

1533
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,260
um

1534
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,420
clearly space became very limited with

1535
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,860
the rise of the cars and the decision

1536
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,380
was made that the space is extremely

1537
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,820
valuable and it should be given to the

1538
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,159
modes that it's the most efficient in

1539
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,080
terms of speed as the most rational mode

1540
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,199
also not only economically or or

1541
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:22,020
temporally efficient so other modes like

1542
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,000
public transport or I don't even mention

1543
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,540
cycling there had to disappear or be

1544
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,280
moved elsewhere and I think what's

1545
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,900
happening right now is some kind of

1546
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,659
revolarization of space

1547
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,640
um but space is always limited so if you

1548
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,280
take it uh I mean if you give it to one

1549
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,739
or some set of users

1550
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:43,380
which I think also perhaps we will have

1551
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,120
time to talk about it next week has a

1552
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,860
clear class component so there is a

1553
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:49,920
clear middle class idea and behind

1554
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,100
opening Central uh Urban spaces to

1555
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,900
walking cycling and public transport and

1556
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,239
taking it away from the car so if you

1557
01:13:57,239 --> 01:13:58,860
give it to these kind of users you have

1558
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,780
to take it away from others in this case

1559
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,920
the car

1560
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,960
and I think an important question is to

1561
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,900
ask well if we want the car to disappear

1562
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,760
from the city like from Brussels who is

1563
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,219
using the car right I mean who is who is

1564
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:13,940
dependent on it for example these

1565
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:17,699
businesses small shops that um I don't

1566
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:20,040
know either well I mean they play

1567
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,540
productive activity requires

1568
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,420
accessibility by car but also I think

1569
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,159
um probably you've heard and right now

1570
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,620
in this pandemic crazy times people are

1571
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:30,300
talking about 15-minute neighborhood and

1572
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,560
the idea of how

1573
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,560
the pandemic has shown us that we can

1574
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,500
well since we uh essentially many of us

1575
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,880
stop a lot of activities we started

1576
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,620
walking around and cycling and all that

1577
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:43,080
so the idea that maybe we could use this

1578
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,840
to reorganize the cities around uh 15

1579
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,060
minutes perimeters walking pyramids

1580
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,980
within which we can all find all the

1581
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,620
uses and functions that we need but I

1582
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,540
think an important question there is who

1583
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:57,480
actually lives so close to a good school

1584
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,719
a good job and all that and then

1585
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,239
Brussels but in many other cities there

1586
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:04,560
will be a lot of people who need to find

1587
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,780
employment uh quite far from where they

1588
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,840
live and a lot of them would have to go

1589
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,840
by car to to get to that job so what you

1590
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,239
know what then

1591
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:16,560
um

1592
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,719
I will continue with the with the

1593
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,400
lecture but I hope there will be space

1594
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,980
for for more for more questions

1595
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,120
um there was one point that I want to

1596
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,480
make that is you know I don't want to

1597
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,340
say main conclusion of this historical

1598
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,500
trajectory but I think an important

1599
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,179
Point

1600
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:35,460
um to keep in mind in in all this is

1601
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:36,719
that

1602
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,040
um

1603
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,679
it's not just a well it's not just a

1604
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:42,480
descriptive you know took the fox of

1605
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,280
what different modes of Transport were

1606
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,440
there and and how it impacted the urban

1607
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,480
reform I think this is something that is

1608
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,860
maybe a little bit interesting but

1609
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,000
essentially I don't think it's very

1610
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,400
critical and doesn't really allow us to

1611
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,860
understand uh too much about how the

1612
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,300
city functions or functioned in the past

1613
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,760
I think what's very important though is

1614
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,560
that with each of these shifts with each

1615
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,060
of these

1616
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,460
um turning points and dynamics that led

1617
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,800
to to uh to a shift in terms of how

1618
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,020
people moved we were getting closer and

1619
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,159
closer

1620
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:13,020
um to the situation that we have today

1621
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:15,060
which is that transport is absolutely

1622
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,219
crucial uh not only for the development

1623
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:19,940
of cities but for the development of

1624
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:23,219
the socio-economic system which we live

1625
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:25,320
uh today on a global scale which is that

1626
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,440
of of global capitalism uh so it would

1627
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,719
be import impossible for for the current

1628
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,820
socioeconomic relations to to develop to

1629
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:33,840
the point that they have developed

1630
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,280
without transport and without the

1631
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,260
development of transport and vice versa

1632
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,239
so outside of the capitalist system

1633
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:41,280
there probably would not have been such

1634
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,560
such a push for development of

1635
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,780
individual vulnerability for example and

1636
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,640
individual Mobility by car that is

1637
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:50,340
propelled by fossil fuels uh with all

1638
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,980
the geopolitical and environmental uh

1639
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,960
atrocities and impacts that this this

1640
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,500
produces

1641
01:16:57,719 --> 01:16:59,760
um essentially transport or transport

1642
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,460
geography is a discipline uh required

1643
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:05,400
space Not only to be conquered

1644
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,380
physically intensive distance basically

1645
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:10,800
uh moving from A to B would become as

1646
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,460
fast as short of a time as possible but

1647
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,800
also uh some kind of imaginary and

1648
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,719
cartographical colonization or

1649
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,320
conquering of space if we go back to end

1650
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,820
of the 18th century for example in

1651
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,040
Europe uh well the majority of people

1652
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,440
who inhabited uh well maybe eight of the

1653
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,880
17th century could be a little bit less

1654
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,800
controversial but the majority of people

1655
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,360
who lived on our continent and

1656
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,679
definitely the majority of people who

1657
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:37,080
lived on our planet did not live on the

1658
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,880
jurisdiction of any state or any any

1659
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,159
state Administration they essentially

1660
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:42,659
lived outside State structures of course

1661
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,360
State States and administrations existed

1662
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,179
but most people lived in villages in

1663
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:51,000
areas where once in a once in a while a

1664
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,560
tax collector would maybe show up it

1665
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,900
would be quite easy to avoid the

1666
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,760
encounter with that kind of gentleman

1667
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,239
rather not gentle woman I'm afraid

1668
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:01,440
so

1669
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,600
it's at this point and I think transport

1670
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,280
is absolutely crucial for understanding

1671
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,540
of why this happened and how this

1672
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,360
happened that there happened or began to

1673
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,100
happen some kind of strategic expansion

1674
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,540
of State infrastructure and state

1675
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,760
Administration predominantly related to

1676
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,920
security reasons and search for you know

1677
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,159
different forms of capital uh for

1678
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,219
instance slavery so trying to uh reach

1679
01:18:23,219 --> 01:18:24,960
different places where bodies could be

1680
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,719
could be snatched taken into captivity

1681
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:29,760
and then and then sold or propelled into

1682
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,860
productive activity

1683
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,860
um but for the state to be able to

1684
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,540
organize this process it had to develop

1685
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,420
its cartography it has to develop its uh

1686
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,760
dominance its knowledge its control over

1687
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,860
the over space

1688
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:46,620
and here we see a map of France in 1632

1689
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,840
which is essentially well we've seen

1690
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,820
some roads we see some cities and and

1691
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:53,100
connections between those

1692
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,520
um but this radically changes with uh

1693
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,080
the development of States interest in

1694
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,239
terms of the resources uh as I mentioned

1695
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,000
bodies people but also of course other

1696
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,460
natural resources would anything that

1697
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:08,640
you can mine and well I don't know I'm

1698
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,020
not a specialist here in terms of who

1699
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,960
you can be interested in as a state but

1700
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,239
uh what essentially happened is that

1701
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:15,780
um

1702
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:18,540
from a natural space a space that was

1703
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:21,659
inhabited a space that was lived uh we

1704
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:24,480
started moving into a fire name of

1705
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,780
obstructive of uh of absolute space that

1706
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:28,920
is very much related to the

1707
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,659
consolidation of of States

1708
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:33,000
infrastructure as a way of organizing

1709
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,760
social and material order that is on the

1710
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,340
ground to bureaucratically govern it to

1711
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,140
rule it from the distance from a very

1712
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,580
top-down perspective

1713
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,440
the example of France is very

1714
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,300
interesting because literally over there

1715
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,159
the decision was made of course not

1716
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:49,020
immediately not at one meeting but

1717
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,520
progressively

1718
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,340
um it was a state bureaucrats arrived a

1719
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,840
decision to divide the state in more or

1720
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,060
less equally shaped

1721
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:57,719
um

1722
01:19:57,719 --> 01:20:00,960
areas the Departments and based on a

1723
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,179
regular grid on the left hand side you

1724
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:03,900
see there's some kind of

1725
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,400
conceptualization of this on the right

1726
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,620
hand side we see a result which is the

1727
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:10,380
the actual the eventual Division I think

1728
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,960
one of the first ones uh in in the in

1729
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,000
the French territory I think today of

1730
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,440
course it's not exactly the same that

1731
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,239
has developed for uh different

1732
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:21,120
historical reasons but the idea was very

1733
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,620
important that the seven the

1734
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:26,159
administrative reform of the 1790 would

1735
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,920
replace some old feudal uh tribal even

1736
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,260
uh division of territories

1737
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,820
into

1738
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,920
um it would be replaced with abstract

1739
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,679
bureaucratic logic that would be applied

1740
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,380
and more or less the same way in each of

1741
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,360
these each of these territories each of

1742
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,900
these uh departments

1743
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:49,380
as we can skip uh what was very

1744
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,360
important in this in this development is

1745
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,420
that the state needed very much uh

1746
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:57,040
um Universal

1747
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:57,719
[Music]

1748
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:58,440
um

1749
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,920
and how to put it a reliable system of

1750
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,100
measuring space and other related

1751
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,480
phenomena such as for example time or

1752
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,480
quantity it might be very difficult for

1753
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,820
us to to imagine this but the

1754
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:14,580
unification of of measuring systems both

1755
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,739
of time and space and quantity was

1756
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:18,540
something that took a very long time and

1757
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,239
it was definitely not in place until end

1758
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:23,940
of the even 17 or 18th century so it

1759
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,980
took a very long time to actually make

1760
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:29,520
sure make sure that all the inhabitants

1761
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,620
of a given nation state of a given

1762
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,780
territory would actually subjugate

1763
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,880
themselves to the usage of of a unified

1764
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,140
that's the word I was looking for

1765
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:41,100
unified metric or measurement system so

1766
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,300
for example the unification of the

1767
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,400
metric systems in Germany took place in

1768
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,699
as late as 1868 in Austria in 1871 and

1769
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:49,739
Hungary three years later in Russia in

1770
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:53,400
1919 and in China only in 1959. what

1771
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,040
does it mean it means that there existed

1772
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,480
of course ways of measuring but there

1773
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,520
will be culturally dependent or there

1774
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,260
will be spatially dependent so a

1775
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,659
particularly a unit of measurement a

1776
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:05,900
foot an elbow

1777
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,280
would mean different things in different

1778
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,840
Villages would mean different things at

1779
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,400
the different times of the day or yeah

1780
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,780
it would mean different things whether

1781
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,900
it would be the activity of selling or

1782
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,420
of buying so for example you would sell

1783
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:22,140
a small bag of rice and buy a big one

1784
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:22,739
um

1785
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:24,659
there was a difference between and

1786
01:22:24,659 --> 01:22:27,380
that's in many pre-colonial African

1787
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:30,120
communities kingdoms there will be a

1788
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,460
division between strong measures for

1789
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,040
selling goods and weak measures for for

1790
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,860
buying loans so there was a huge

1791
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:40,560
diversity of different ways of measuring

1792
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,360
space measuring time and measuring

1793
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,719
quantity all that in order and also

1794
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:48,120
because of and again this is a two-way

1795
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,280
Dynamic the development of the transport

1796
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,860
system and the development of State as a

1797
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:54,480
institution or a set of Institutions

1798
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,940
that had to control space quantity and

1799
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:01,679
time gave way to a unified system

1800
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,960
of which transport is absolutely Central

1801
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,840
and here I mean the symbolic one meter

1802
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,659
which is of course a huge abstract

1803
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:12,300
agreement that we are in that this is

1804
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,580
what one meter is and same could be said

1805
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:16,500
about a kilogram a second and many

1806
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,640
others

1807
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:20,699
moving a little bit more uh well going a

1808
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:23,280
little bit more into transport here

1809
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,920
um I mentioned time and for example as

1810
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,500
late as in the 18th century uh distance

1811
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,000
between particular cities and as a

1812
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,199
result of travel time speaking in

1813
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:33,179
particular cities such as in Germany

1814
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:37,140
we're not fixed or or set

1815
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:40,320
um so in 1881 German Railways or

1816
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,940
different kinds of German Railways

1817
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:43,260
because there was no one National system

1818
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,000
followed five different time zones which

1819
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,640
were different not by one hour but by a

1820
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,920
different amount of minutes which meant

1821
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,219
that basically one area I guess they are

1822
01:23:53,219 --> 01:23:55,860
here color coded would be five or seven

1823
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,480
minutes ahead of the other one which

1824
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,920
meant that the passengers had to do the

1825
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,260
calculation themselves it was all an

1826
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,659
oral agreement and an ongoing discussion

1827
01:24:03,659 --> 01:24:05,040
between

1828
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,420
um between the passengers and the staff

1829
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:08,940
to understand at what time uh things

1830
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,440
would happen what time the train would

1831
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,000
depart leave

1832
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,179
Etc

1833
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:15,719
um

1834
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:19,440
and as I mentioned the this integration

1835
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,960
of of measurement system integration of

1836
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,420
uh of different modes of Transport

1837
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:28,260
networks allowed the state to control to

1838
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:30,719
consolidate the territory and to

1839
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:33,840
um and to yeah to basically be able to

1840
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,000
develop socioeconomic relations that we

1841
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,699
take today very much for for granted

1842
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:42,960
um this was absolutely crucial I mean

1843
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,340
the reason why I'm making this a bit of

1844
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:46,080
a digression and the departure from you

1845
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,179
know this historic uh trajectory is that

1846
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:50,100
this was absolutely crucial this

1847
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:52,080
colonization of space and colonization

1848
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,060
of what we consider to be a very much of

1849
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,340
a social or could consider a social

1850
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,679
activity that movement and transport is

1851
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:00,540
was absolutely crucial for the

1852
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:02,520
development of again what we take very

1853
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,980
much for granted the global networks of

1854
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,920
wires cables railroads highways in this

1855
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,500
particular case I already show you that

1856
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,060
um that map

1857
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:16,080
allowing transport to to lubricate the

1858
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,900
capitalist global global system

1859
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:22,020
and today this colonization of space uh

1860
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,640
if we can call it this way it's no

1861
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,739
longer a national matter is no longer

1862
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:26,940
nation states that are propelling this

1863
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,380
process it's something that is happening

1864
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,500
very much on the on the global scales

1865
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,300
um

1866
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,060
what was very important in this very

1867
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,100
long trajectory I started very quickly

1868
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,199
at the end of the 17th century and now

1869
01:25:40,199 --> 01:25:43,260
we are in 1950s what was very important

1870
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,679
is that a whole science developed around

1871
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:48,600
uh this colonization of different

1872
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,540
measuring systems of different uh ways

1873
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:54,060
of of living and interacting with space

1874
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:56,159
and this science of this scientific

1875
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,900
field

1876
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,239
I think we can call it a set of

1877
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,880
neoclassical perspectives on not only

1878
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,500
transport but also in economics on

1879
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:07,920
social life which in transport itself is

1880
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,380
very much present is very much dominated

1881
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,699
by

1882
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:13,560
um on the one hand transport Engineers

1883
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,120
on the other hand transport Econo

1884
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,860
economists what I'm talking about here

1885
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,719
is basically

1886
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,900
um the main say and I will not talk a

1887
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,639
lot about this but basically if you went

1888
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:25,139
to

1889
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:27,780
um a master degree which I'm very happy

1890
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,760
you did it but if you went to a mass

1891
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,560
degree in in transport management or

1892
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,080
Logistics at any Technical University

1893
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,520
this is very much what you would be

1894
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,719
learning today

1895
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,760
I guess at this time of the Neo night

1896
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,980
which we are a bit more boring I hope

1897
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:43,560
than what I have to offer but

1898
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,420
um hope there is no regrets here in the

1899
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:47,460
room today but uh if you want to be an

1900
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,540
engineer and if you want to be an

1901
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,860
economist to build roads this is

1902
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:52,620
basically what you what you learn why is

1903
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,840
it called neoclassical transport well

1904
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,460
very much it relates to new classical

1905
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:59,460
economics which deals with uh a

1906
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:02,219
cold-blooded analysis A study of

1907
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:05,280
distribution production of goods outputs

1908
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,800
and and income through uh and that's

1909
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,760
absolutely crucial supply and demand so

1910
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,320
a system which has to be in a permanent

1911
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:15,260
equilibrium

1912
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:18,239
which essentially looks at transport as

1913
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:22,380
a part or a separate Market in which

1914
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:25,020
transport is a good commodity which is

1915
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:28,020
offered in the market passengers being

1916
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:31,820
the being its consumers

1917
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,360
um

1918
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,400
what is important here there are two

1919
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,699
main principles which very much today

1920
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:41,219
again in Academia but also very much in

1921
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:43,080
the world of practitioners so the wealth

1922
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,060
of those who plan roads who build roads

1923
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,920
who claim that we need a new metro line

1924
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,800
we need Motorway or that this or that

1925
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,060
particular mode of Transport is

1926
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,440
absolutely essential for for

1927
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,900
contemporary cities to thrive

1928
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,300
so these two dogmas say that on the one

1929
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,340
hand transport is an essentially

1930
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,280
rational discipline it's a it's a

1931
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,199
discipline that is rational because it

1932
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:07,500
has to be developed by by experts it's a

1933
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,900
top-down discipline that requires this

1934
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,060
top-down cartographic vision of space

1935
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:14,659
which can be reduced to its absolute

1936
01:28:14,659 --> 01:28:17,100
Universal measures

1937
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,300
um that also means that there is a

1938
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,400
science behind it which means that it's

1939
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,380
not an issue that can be fully opened to

1940
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,620
a public debate it's a it's a part of

1941
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,420
urban life that has to be developed by

1942
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:30,000
experts and only experts can have the

1943
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,980
final word in terms of decision making

1944
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:34,760
uh in terms of how transport develops

1945
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,780
why and and using what most

1946
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,080
um there is a very strong prediction

1947
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,120
there in this uh in this in this field

1948
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,699
of of knowledge that transport geography

1949
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,620
or or transport economics engineering

1950
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:48,780
are essentially objective Sciences they

1951
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:50,400
are they are much more on the side of

1952
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,199
science sciences and Humanities for

1953
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:55,020
example they they purpose being pursuing

1954
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,480
objectivity and truth that's a quote

1955
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,639
from another very important textbook on

1956
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:02,340
on transport geography the idea being is

1957
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,260
that we can arrive some kind of absolute

1958
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,540
truths in terms of what is good

1959
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:09,260
transport and wonder what is bad which

1960
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,460
essentially are translatable

1961
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:13,260
transferable from one locality to

1962
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:16,199
another so if uh if we go back to the

1963
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:21,080
1950s if the US cities develop

1964
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,100
motorways and develop car infrastructure

1965
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:24,600
which is efficient and rational this is

1966
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,000
a solution that can also work in dense

1967
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,300
medieval European cities uh such as the

1968
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,080
ones in Belgium Brussels for example

1969
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:34,679
um

1970
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:37,679
crucially this line of thinking and that

1971
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:39,960
maybe didn't develop in the end of the

1972
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,420
17th or 19th century but was definitely

1973
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:45,000
a result of this uh process that I

1974
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,219
called the colonization of space

1975
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:50,580
this field of of thinking and and

1976
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:52,860
producing uh transport Consolidated

1977
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:56,100
itself around the 1930s and 40s and that

1978
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,480
propelled

1979
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,699
um measurements and engineering studies

1980
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:02,880
that allowed to to construct these

1981
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,219
um into urban and intra-urban Motorway

1982
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:07,260
systems and this very much continues

1983
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:10,920
today following a rule of predicting uh

1984
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,159
demand for for Mobility predicting

1985
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:17,000
passenger flows or traffic flows and

1986
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,860
providing necessary infrastructure for

1987
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:23,280
it so basically most of Transport most

1988
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:27,199
of which transport models do is predict

1989
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:30,560
where would these flows go and provide

1990
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,940
essential infrastructure an extension of

1991
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:33,900
a

1992
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,300
of Road Lane a construction of a new

1993
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,880
Motorway construction of a new Metro uh

1994
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,060
line and you name it

1995
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,340
so that's one part of the rationality of

1996
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,560
Transport the other part is that the

1997
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,620
assumption is that the user itself uh

1998
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:54,360
and uh it's yeah yeah the user itself is

1999
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,420
also a rational being it's a homo

2000
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,239
economicus it's an it's an economically

2001
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:03,480
minded being that

2002
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,340
um almost on a regular basis on a daily

2003
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:06,900
basis conduct some kind of economic

2004
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:10,020
analysis in terms of what is uh an

2005
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:11,580
efficient way of of reaching a

2006
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:14,280
destination B from from point A in terms

2007
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,739
of time in terms of cost

2008
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:19,980
um being making pragmatic free and and

2009
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,260
very much utility-based choices in terms

2010
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:25,080
of how to move and where to move

2011
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,080
so in other words a market a market that

2012
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,960
is being governed by by the laws of uh

2013
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,139
of Economics which very much in this in

2014
01:31:34,139 --> 01:31:35,760
this line of thought are being compared

2015
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,219
to the laws of physics a lot of these

2016
01:31:38,219 --> 01:31:40,199
models would have for example allusions

2017
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:43,860
to gravity so gravity models that uh in

2018
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:46,560
a natural-like way pools uh flows of

2019
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,600
passengers to some destinations rather

2020
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,400
than others because for example economic

2021
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,120
activities present in an area

2022
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,340
so that's

2023
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:57,719
principle of Dogma number one and number

2024
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:00,600
two is that uh there is this very strong

2025
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,380
conviction and funny enough still not

2026
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:06,480
fully fully proven but uh but the

2027
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,880
conviction is very much there that

2028
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,080
investment in transport infrastructure

2029
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,900
uh of course uh that part is not

2030
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:15,540
controversial leads to higher speeds uh

2031
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,940
leads to lower travel times at least

2032
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,800
lower transaction costs if you want to

2033
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,139
move from A to B or yourself or some

2034
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:24,480
Goods it's basically cheaper leads to

2035
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,219
Economic Development so the better

2036
01:32:26,219 --> 01:32:29,460
infrastructure we have the the higher or

2037
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:32,699
the better the growth of a locality so

2038
01:32:32,699 --> 01:32:35,159
if you want the city to be economically

2039
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:39,600
prosperous uh wealthy you need

2040
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,820
um you need Quality Transport

2041
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,639
infrastructure

2042
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:45,300
um

2043
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:49,320
so that very much is on the pin by this

2044
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,940
um by this quote that I already

2045
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:52,500
mentioned earlier today that the unique

2046
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,719
purpose of Transport is in fact to to

2047
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,300
limit to reduce space and time that is

2048
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:00,179
needed to cover the space to zero that

2049
01:33:00,179 --> 01:33:01,920
that is the unique purpose of of

2050
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,219
movement in in the city which also means

2051
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:06,900
that the travel time itself is an

2052
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:09,239
unproductive activity because from the

2053
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:10,739
monetary perspective if you want to go

2054
01:33:10,739 --> 01:33:12,179
from A to B

2055
01:33:12,179 --> 01:33:13,739
um well you want to get there as quickly

2056
01:33:13,739 --> 01:33:15,179
as possible the time of getting there

2057
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:18,360
itself is not a valuable activity now

2058
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,159
there are I mean there's a flurry of

2059
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:21,659
problems here starting from the fact

2060
01:33:21,659 --> 01:33:23,340
that if you actually ask people through

2061
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,440
studies uh what they do when they take

2062
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,719
the metro or where they cycle which is

2063
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:30,060
such a complicated and multi-faceted

2064
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,520
activity they very often say that this

2065
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,380
is actually a very important part of the

2066
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,540
day that commuting on public transport

2067
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,699
for example allows them to catch up with

2068
01:33:38,699 --> 01:33:41,159
friends to read to relax to meditate

2069
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:43,880
cycling being as I mentioned

2070
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,260
multi-faceted activity allows people to

2071
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:49,100
get relaxed work out

2072
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:52,380
get an endorphin kick and and all that

2073
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,600
and that's so much more than just moving

2074
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,760
from from one place to

2075
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,300
um to another

2076
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,659
um but again without trying to draw some

2077
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:04,920
kind of caricature I think it's

2078
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:07,620
important to to understand that this way

2079
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:10,080
of thinking about transport leads us to

2080
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,820
a formulation of an absolutely

2081
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:14,699
fundamental problem uh in inverted

2082
01:34:14,699 --> 01:34:16,679
commas that a lot of Engineers transport

2083
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:18,480
Engineers transport economists recognize

2084
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,480
and that problem is congestion if you

2085
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,679
focus on a fluid flow of

2086
01:34:24,679 --> 01:34:27,960
passengers cars whatever the transport

2087
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,540
mode is any obstruction to that flow any

2088
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,400
obstruction to that model is a is a

2089
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,260
problem that has to be solved

2090
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,420
and that problem has to be solved

2091
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,860
because otherwise the system is

2092
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:39,659
irrational that's talking about number

2093
01:34:39,659 --> 01:34:41,280
one and

2094
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:44,639
the second reason is that uh and unless

2095
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,340
you do that you uh you can

2096
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:48,000
um

2097
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,219
hamper the economic growth the economic

2098
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:52,320
development of of the locality that

2099
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,840
you're in in charge of

2100
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:58,020
as I mentioned this uh this beneficial

2101
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,580
supposedly beneficial relationship

2102
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,080
between transport development and

2103
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,360
economic development so better roads

2104
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,460
mean better transport better exchange of

2105
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:07,620
goods and services

2106
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,420
um that of course Works to some extent I

2107
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,760
mean you can you can see that happening

2108
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,520
theoretically at least from scratch in

2109
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,040
um in many cities many countries of the

2110
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,800
global South but then uh this relation

2111
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,120
has never really been theorized it's

2112
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,679
never really been proven and it will be

2113
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:24,659
extremely difficult to to make that

2114
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:28,620
claim in cities that are postmodern so

2115
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:30,659
such as Brussels or many other cities in

2116
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:31,500
the global North but actually

2117
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,360
increasingly also Global South so

2118
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,460
addition of infrastructure especially

2119
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:38,940
road infrastructure car infrastructure

2120
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:41,400
um and it's anticipated impact in terms

2121
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,380
of economic growth Economic Development

2122
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,300
it's it's a very controversial issue

2123
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,560
that

2124
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,540
um well it's not really we don't have

2125
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,840
any tangible proof or tangible enough to

2126
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,120
to uh to say with certainty that this is

2127
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:54,960
the case

2128
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,840
but it's an argument that you can hear a

2129
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,940
lot and including in Brussels and

2130
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:01,080
Belgium

2131
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:04,199
is this clear do you have any questions

2132
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:05,639
this is usually where people are

2133
01:36:05,639 --> 01:36:08,460
scratching their hands a little bit so I

2134
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,280
want to make sure that you are okay

2135
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:13,199
uh nobody is writing anything in the

2136
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,739
chat no Angry comments I keep

2137
01:36:16,739 --> 01:36:19,020
advancing here then

2138
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:21,000
um so what happens when you when you

2139
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,040
believe that what you do is is rational

2140
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,080
and and it's very important for Society

2141
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,880
for economy

2142
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,080
well you essentially engage in I mean

2143
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,300
um developing more and more and more to

2144
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,699
elaborate and complicated mathematical

2145
01:36:35,699 --> 01:36:38,520
models that try to predict not only to

2146
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,080
describe what's happening without

2147
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,780
actually trying to predict uh what is

2148
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,520
going to happen and what is now

2149
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,260
happening very much in the business of

2150
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:47,880
transport economics and transport

2151
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,679
engineering is modeling human behavior

2152
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,800
so trying to predict uh where people

2153
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,420
will be interested in going and not

2154
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:56,159
anymore where where they are actually

2155
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,679
are heading and where these flaws are

2156
01:36:58,679 --> 01:37:00,239
being distributed in an urban

2157
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:03,360
environment what's crucial here is that

2158
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,620
this field is extremely not only

2159
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,360
extremely Technical and quantitative but

2160
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:09,420
it's very indescriptive so this logic of

2161
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,219
Transport Supply and transport demand is

2162
01:37:11,219 --> 01:37:14,340
is devoid of any social uh cultural

2163
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:18,000
political uh relations so

2164
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,699
when I say that a transport user this

2165
01:37:20,699 --> 01:37:22,860
homo economicus is considered to be this

2166
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:26,280
rational utility-based uh person or

2167
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,440
figure that makes these rational choices

2168
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,600
in terms of where they go and how any

2169
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:33,060
issue of gender any issue of class or

2170
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:36,120
ethnicity of age is

2171
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,540
um at best mentioned but given a very

2172
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:41,280
little weight if we are talking about

2173
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,199
modeling so these different aspects can

2174
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,060
be given different ways given different

2175
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:47,699
importance importance different levels

2176
01:37:47,699 --> 01:37:50,040
of levels of importance and these issues

2177
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,980
are quite simply not not there and of

2178
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,540
course we will be discussing this a

2179
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:55,620
little bit I mean these different

2180
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,880
critical approaches such as

2181
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,100
well some anti-capitalist marxists

2182
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:03,380
feminist

2183
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:07,080
uh any radical Theory social theory the

2184
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,239
exposure to those in engineering

2185
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:12,060
programs is close to none

2186
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,340
um which basically means that without

2187
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:16,380
trying to be you know too critical about

2188
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,699
the engineers who are trying to do their

2189
01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:18,780
job

2190
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,460
um basically they they are really not

2191
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,800
aware of of the complexity of social

2192
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,480
relations and spatial relations that are

2193
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,800
happening in the city so everything that

2194
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,139
you've learned with David bass and Nick

2195
01:38:28,139 --> 01:38:31,620
by now this is this is simply not there

2196
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:34,080
um a city according to this vision is

2197
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,920
essentially a a model that can be

2198
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,199
um constructed calculated and put in

2199
01:38:40,199 --> 01:38:43,860
place and you can predict what will

2200
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:45,659
happen uh tomorrow or the day after

2201
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:49,020
based on that in any City in the in the

2202
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:49,739
world

2203
01:38:49,739 --> 01:38:54,719
now that thinking uh has a very yeah

2204
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:58,080
very very strange uh way of Imagining

2205
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,020
the city essentially if a city is or any

2206
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:03,239
Urban space is more of a field of

2207
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:05,639
application than than actually a side of

2208
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:07,260
any Dynamics or conflicts or

2209
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:09,960
contradictions uh different interests in

2210
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,400
terms of what should be happening in

2211
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,620
that space in that in that society and

2212
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:16,159
I'm sure that you've all come across um

2213
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:19,199
uh maybe even these drawings or similar

2214
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:22,380
ones from from Nicole busier and his and

2215
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,300
his friends and allies who basically

2216
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,739
imagine that this is exactly what should

2217
01:39:25,739 --> 01:39:28,199
happen in in a modern city that these

2218
01:39:28,199 --> 01:39:30,840
models not only related to transport in

2219
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,639
this case also to housing or generally

2220
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,560
Economic Development should be literally

2221
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,659
applied in a city

2222
01:39:36,659 --> 01:39:39,360
um so the idea there would be that in

2223
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,860
order to for that model to be as

2224
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,020
efficient as possible everything in the

2225
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,480
city especially it's medieval it's

2226
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,239
pre-industrial uh remnants would have to

2227
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:49,860
be raised the city would have to become

2228
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:53,280
black empathy slave on which this model

2229
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,820
could be applied

2230
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:59,820
so

2231
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,880
even though

2232
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:05,159
this maybe wasn't its most extreme in

2233
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:07,920
the 1950s in the 1960s when these Urban

2234
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,920
motorways were being constructed when as

2235
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,659
I showed you these Urban tramways and

2236
01:40:12,659 --> 01:40:14,040
Brussels were being put on the ground

2237
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:17,219
and a lot of heavy construction offers

2238
01:40:17,219 --> 01:40:20,040
destruction had to be done this thinking

2239
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,560
still very much applies this if you if

2240
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,480
you tune in to Engineers from

2241
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,159
construction offices in Brussels or

2242
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:28,679
elsewhere in Belgium

2243
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:31,920
northern Europe the idea is that uh

2244
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,860
planning still has to fall follow uh

2245
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,659
some rational rules of solving

2246
01:40:36,659 --> 01:40:39,120
congestion uh in Brussels for example we

2247
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,980
have a Belgium a long-standing debate

2248
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:42,060
about what to do with the Ring of

2249
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,739
Brussels the Ring Road whether it has to

2250
01:40:43,739 --> 01:40:45,600
be expanded or not every single time

2251
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,159
there is an engineer talking on the

2252
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:49,800
radio or on the news what their solution

2253
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,600
would be is to add to the infrastructure

2254
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,100
because basically if you have traffic

2255
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:55,560
jams that generates lost time that's

2256
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,360
detrimental to the economy you have to

2257
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,920
expand that infrastructure in order for

2258
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:01,080
the flows to be more fluid and

2259
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,679
unobstructed

2260
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:06,659
This Modern neoclassical thinking also

2261
01:41:06,659 --> 01:41:10,500
uh well thinking about the fluidity of

2262
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,560
flows and and removing barriers to these

2263
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,719
led to a separation of different modes

2264
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:18,300
of Transport so this is this is why we

2265
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:22,380
would have uh overpasses uh food bridges

2266
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:25,440
that would allow of well separate

2267
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,360
pedestrians from Cars For example so

2268
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,400
allow the cars to have

2269
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:32,880
um a smooth smooth space infrastructure

2270
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,980
to for movement while pedestrians would

2271
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:36,260
have to

2272
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:40,679
cross it uh cross it over all the energy

2273
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:43,380
and that of course also

2274
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:45,000
um that line of thought would be very

2275
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,980
much related or very much inspired also

2276
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:48,540
by the development of individual

2277
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:51,360
Mobility via VIA the car right so the

2278
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,760
car being not only this extremely

2279
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,920
freeing mode of Transport also a very

2280
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,659
rational and very fast way of moving

2281
01:41:57,659 --> 01:41:58,920
around

2282
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,540
now

2283
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:03,719
we arrived to the 1970s let's say and

2284
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:05,159
something very important happened around

2285
01:42:05,159 --> 01:42:06,239
that time

2286
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:08,040
would anybody have an idea looking at

2287
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:11,940
the pictures uh What uh what I have in

2288
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:13,500
mind

2289
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:16,020
not change the way that we look at the

2290
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:18,000
car the change of the way we look at the

2291
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,199
transport

2292
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,840
the only crisis in the oil crisis I

2293
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,340
guess somebody already mentioned that in

2294
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,719
one of the classes

2295
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:27,540
so the oil trucks of the 1970s

2296
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:31,340
um when first in the 1973 uh the

2297
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:33,780
organization of our petroleum exporting

2298
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:35,520
countries so essentially the the Persian

2299
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,400
Gulf countries uh instituted Noel

2300
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:41,159
embargo in the 1979 Iranian Revolution

2301
01:42:41,159 --> 01:42:43,679
uh took place that's not something that

2302
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:46,199
you can easily model that's geopolitics

2303
01:42:46,199 --> 01:42:47,820
for you and what basically happened is

2304
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,440
that the global oil prices went through

2305
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,940
the roof

2306
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:53,100
um not maybe for a moment for a longer

2307
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:55,199
time but and then they went

2308
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:57,239
um down a little bit to a level that

2309
01:42:57,239 --> 01:42:59,219
allowed of course for for car-based

2310
01:42:59,219 --> 01:43:02,100
Mobility to to continue but the what

2311
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:04,199
basically happened was that

2312
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:06,060
um on a global scale

2313
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:09,000
decision makers people who were in

2314
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,440
charge of Designing transport

2315
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:12,960
infrastructure realized that this

2316
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,719
Limitless Mobility by car has its um

2317
01:43:15,719 --> 01:43:17,580
it's its economic cost First of all that

2318
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:20,159
fossil fuels might not be as available

2319
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,980
as as they as they used to be but also

2320
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:26,040
around that time began to begin some

2321
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:29,179
kind of uh

2322
01:43:29,699 --> 01:43:32,540
move to this slide already uh

2323
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:35,580
reflection on on different externalities

2324
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:37,199
of different also social and

2325
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,540
environmental costs that are related to

2326
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,940
to car based Mobility these

2327
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:43,380
environmental costs being for example

2328
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:45,980
are predominantly noise

2329
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:48,840
of course accidents health related

2330
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:51,780
issues uh mostly related to pollution

2331
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:54,719
that is that is created by by individual

2332
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:57,119
costs

2333
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:57,780
um

2334
01:43:57,780 --> 01:44:00,659
and around that time I mean maybe it's

2335
01:44:00,659 --> 01:44:01,980
also difficult for us to imagine but

2336
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:06,420
until the 1970s the idea that a car uh

2337
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:08,040
to be efficient in terms of its fuel

2338
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:10,199
consumption it has to be safe in terms

2339
01:44:10,199 --> 01:44:12,420
of making sure that if it hits other

2340
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,340
vehicles or with his pedestrians or

2341
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:17,639
cyclists it has to be more or less safe

2342
01:44:17,639 --> 01:44:19,980
and and that there are these different

2343
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:22,860
areas of the car that uh that absorb the

2344
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:26,000
the energy of the impact that was all uh

2345
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,020
essentially noted there with some

2346
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:31,020
exceptions uh a car was

2347
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,179
um the cars were not efficient from the

2348
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:35,400
from the economic perspective from the

2349
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,940
environmental perspective either

2350
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:42,900
uh what changed is that well I'm again

2351
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:45,540
moving very fast to these uh through

2352
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:47,760
these developments but what changed is

2353
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,580
that there was uh first a reflection on

2354
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,260
the environmental and impact of the car

2355
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:53,880
itself

2356
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:55,980
um and a general reflection on the on

2357
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:57,360
the question of sustainable development

2358
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,300
of development that

2359
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:02,340
allows uh future generations to benefit

2360
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:04,020
from the same resources from the same

2361
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:06,179
opportunities that we are we are

2362
01:45:06,179 --> 01:45:09,300
benefiting from today so some kind of

2363
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:11,460
beginning of a reflection in terms of

2364
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:13,860
the planetary limits of of the growth

2365
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,920
that our societies are of the societies

2366
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:20,040
at the time where we're engaging in

2367
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:23,520
and also an idea that uh

2368
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,500
uh cities are absolutely crucial for

2369
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:29,340
that in that process that in order to

2370
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:31,980
arrive with uh at sustainability of the

2371
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:34,139
development on the planetary level uh

2372
01:45:34,139 --> 01:45:36,780
cities have to uh have to also be

2373
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:39,000
transformed in order to become more

2374
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,960
sustainable

2375
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:46,199
why is that important and we arrive to

2376
01:45:46,199 --> 01:45:50,040
to today to contemporary situation well

2377
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:53,340
it's important and yeah this is as also

2378
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:56,760
the title uh says this is the

2379
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:58,500
let's say a

2380
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:00,840
another set of also very dominant and

2381
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:02,840
very very important hegemonic

2382
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:05,159
perspectives on transport sustainable

2383
01:46:05,159 --> 01:46:06,780
Urban transport this is because

2384
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:09,360
transport is recognized today as one of

2385
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,580
the most important sources of um or

2386
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:14,940
contributors to pollution here we uh see

2387
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:17,580
that it's at least 14 of CO2 Emissions

2388
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,980
on the on the global scale as the uh

2389
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:22,560
direct emissions

2390
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,540
um and also while the graph I would say

2391
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,980
that it's a little bit controversial

2392
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,780
because you also could add much more in

2393
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,940
terms of the different other related

2394
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,699
course on construction and and the way

2395
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:34,619
that housing is constructed as as a

2396
01:46:34,619 --> 01:46:36,900
function of of availability of Transport

2397
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,420
but let's say we stick to the 14 of

2398
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:41,280
global emissions being related directly

2399
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,619
to transport which makes transport one

2400
01:46:43,619 --> 01:46:45,300
of the

2401
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:47,159
um well here I'm a little bit wrong that

2402
01:46:47,159 --> 01:46:48,540
is the largest single source of global

2403
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,920
Transportation emissions because you

2404
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,960
immediately see that industry is at 21

2405
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,760
but it can be also boiled to the

2406
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,500
different sectors and all that but

2407
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,300
what's very important with transport is

2408
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,100
that this um definitely one of the

2409
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:02,340
fastest if not the fastest uh Rising uh

2410
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:04,020
contributed to to emissions so every

2411
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,699
year the increase is the highest among

2412
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:08,820
all economic sectors globally so Global

2413
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:10,560
Climate problems are essentially

2414
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,380
increasingly transport problems this is

2415
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:16,260
uh this is let's say maybe not Point of

2416
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:17,280
Departure but one of the main

2417
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,440
reflections of this perspective on on

2418
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,420
the issue

2419
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:23,760
what also is very important is that as

2420
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,639
you see on the left hand side the global

2421
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:28,619
proportion of people living in in urban

2422
01:47:28,619 --> 01:47:32,639
communities is rising so one if in 2010

2423
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:36,060
we were already after this magic uh

2424
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:38,520
threshold of 50 or more of people living

2425
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:40,520
in cities as opposed to the countryside

2426
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:43,980
in 2030 the projection is that it will

2427
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:45,960
be 60 of people living in cities and

2428
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:49,080
that will go up to at least 67 in 2015.

2429
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,540
of course this is a mantra that I'm sure

2430
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:52,800
that at least those of you who follow

2431
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,300
the master and urban Studies have

2432
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,340
already heard before that we are living

2433
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:59,659
in an urban society that you know and

2434
01:47:59,659 --> 01:48:02,580
our planet is essentially in urban and

2435
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:04,860
urban planetary urbanization there's a

2436
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:08,580
lot of Concepts uh flying flying around

2437
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:12,119
but it's important and it is a fact that

2438
01:48:12,119 --> 01:48:13,800
increasingly the global population

2439
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:16,619
becoming more and more urban it's in the

2440
01:48:16,619 --> 01:48:18,239
cities that a lot of these problems will

2441
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:19,619
have to be addressed so the urban

2442
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:21,719
Mobility is not only the transport is

2443
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:23,760
crucial for solving the climate crisis

2444
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,320
but it's the urban transport that

2445
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:27,659
constitutes definitely a very important

2446
01:48:27,659 --> 01:48:30,719
uh challenge that has to be addressed so

2447
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,520
we see that and that's the right hand

2448
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:35,760
side graft graph that Urban Mobility

2449
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:38,400
demand for urban Mobility is rising uh

2450
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,780
almost exponentially

2451
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:41,460
and that's expressing trillions of

2452
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:44,639
kilometers per year here uh that it Rose

2453
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:49,860
from uh 2010 to 2030 by uh 68 percent

2454
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:53,040
now we might think that with all the

2455
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,619
reflection on externalities that cars

2456
01:48:55,619 --> 01:48:58,560
have and produce an environmental and

2457
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,840
social aspects that are very detrimental

2458
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:03,780
to to our lives

2459
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:06,360
um that we are moving away from the car

2460
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:08,699
this is a perspective that we already

2461
01:49:08,699 --> 01:49:11,219
had a short charge on that there is a

2462
01:49:11,219 --> 01:49:13,440
shift so we start to look at Urban space

2463
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,880
a little bit differently we want less

2464
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,340
cars to be present in it and in fact on

2465
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:18,780
a global scale

2466
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:20,820
um if you look at the on the left hand

2467
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:23,639
side as a cumulative figure so the

2468
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:26,219
global number of all registered cars uh

2469
01:49:26,219 --> 01:49:29,699
the rise is is ongoing and it's um and

2470
01:49:29,699 --> 01:49:32,659
it's huge and that's

2471
01:49:32,659 --> 01:49:35,580
well also seen in the graph on the right

2472
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:37,760
hand side where we see non-cumulative

2473
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,760
yearly amount of cars being sold

2474
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:43,440
on a global scale so we see that every

2475
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,480
year the amount of cars being sold is

2476
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:48,719
rising 2019 being some sort of an

2477
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:50,219
exception we have a little bit of a drop

2478
01:49:50,219 --> 01:49:53,100
but what the graph doesn't not show is

2479
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:56,100
the amount of SUV so the sports utility

2480
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:58,440
vehicles as they are called which went

2481
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:01,619
through the roof in 2018 and 2019 their

2482
01:50:01,619 --> 01:50:03,420
contribution environmentally speaking

2483
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:05,520
being much uh High a few times higher

2484
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,100
than regular vehicles what also you can

2485
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:11,460
see over there is that in Orange if you

2486
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:13,560
see that the contribution we can call it

2487
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,179
this way of the European Union countries

2488
01:50:15,179 --> 01:50:18,060
in terms of the number of cars sold is

2489
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:20,699
more or less stable so here we don't see

2490
01:50:20,699 --> 01:50:23,100
um an important rise if you look at

2491
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:26,900
India in Gray and then on China in Blue

2492
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:30,239
uh here the difference between 2005 and

2493
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,580
2019 is significant

2494
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:36,719
so there is a lot of economies some call

2495
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:38,219
them developing economies I'm not really

2496
01:50:38,219 --> 01:50:40,560
a fan of the word but um

2497
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,239
a lot of nation states a lot of

2498
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:44,100
societies where where the levels of

2499
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:46,260
motorizations were relatively low and

2500
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:49,500
this commodity is is definitely becoming

2501
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,719
uh more and more available it's not

2502
01:50:51,719 --> 01:50:52,980
exactly the same process that was

2503
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:55,619
happening uh in in northern Europe or

2504
01:50:55,619 --> 01:50:57,659
North America or Western Europe or North

2505
01:50:57,659 --> 01:51:01,679
America in the 1940s 50s and 60s but uh

2506
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:03,780
it's definitely a steep rise of

2507
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:06,659
motorization of Mobility levels which

2508
01:51:06,659 --> 01:51:08,460
raises a lot of environmental questions

2509
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:10,800
but also ethical issues in terms of

2510
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,159
whether this is something that

2511
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:16,800
um well we now with our Western Northern

2512
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,199
eyes are looking at very critically

2513
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:21,000
matter of fact it's something that these

2514
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,679
people these societies have the right to

2515
01:51:22,679 --> 01:51:25,320
engage in as as we did as our parents

2516
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:29,159
and grandparents did some decades ago

2517
01:51:29,159 --> 01:51:31,440
um but what is very important here I'm

2518
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,480
going to skip this one slide is that

2519
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:35,760
this debate if we can put it this way

2520
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:38,280
shifts its attention so we're moving

2521
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:41,639
away from the problem of congestion the

2522
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:43,520
problem of uh

2523
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,199
unobstructed flows uh the problem of

2524
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:48,600
rationality the problem of Economic

2525
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,760
Development we see that this Economic

2526
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:53,580
Development has its

2527
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:57,119
um environmental price if we can put it

2528
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:59,639
this way and in a very important and

2529
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:01,560
very important and symbol of that in

2530
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:04,260
mobility in transport is the car is is

2531
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:05,880
the car is the

2532
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:09,239
important contributor to to that uh to

2533
01:52:09,239 --> 01:52:11,400
that cake in terms of pollution in terms

2534
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:13,739
of externalities of

2535
01:52:13,739 --> 01:52:15,900
um of transport

2536
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:18,420
and next time so we still have a bit

2537
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:21,060
time for questions maybe discussion

2538
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:23,159
we're going to talk about specific

2539
01:52:23,159 --> 01:52:26,219
examples of how transport develops along

2540
01:52:26,219 --> 01:52:28,020
this line of thought

2541
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:32,340
but and I think we'll be uh well it's

2542
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:33,480
definitely not the only thing we're

2543
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,040
going to do because as I will also

2544
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,020
explain in a week

2545
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:39,300
um that perspective also is extremely

2546
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:42,840
Limited in its lack of social and also

2547
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:45,300
spatial understanding of the city so a

2548
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,340
simple critique of the car as the

2549
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:50,159
problem is also leading us into a number

2550
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:54,199
of traps which mean that our

2551
01:52:54,199 --> 01:52:57,600
understanding of how people enjoy or do

2552
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,760
not enjoy Mobility because of the class

2553
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,860
the gender the ethnicity and many other

2554
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:06,179
factors is extremely Limited

2555
01:53:06,179 --> 01:53:09,719
so I put a little comma here

2556
01:53:09,719 --> 01:53:11,119
um I wonder if you have any questions

2557
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:14,100
any points of discussion

2558
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:16,920
we still have 12 minutes so we might as

2559
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:18,659
well use them

2560
01:53:18,659 --> 01:53:22,520
just ice

2561
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:25,739
I might

2562
01:53:25,739 --> 01:53:26,460
um

2563
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:30,080
try to initiate a little discussion here

2564
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:34,440
about about popularity of cars and

2565
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:35,219
um

2566
01:53:35,219 --> 01:53:38,460
and the Smiths that we're now seeing of

2567
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:42,780
of the of the of the lifestyle on high

2568
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:45,780
speed and Etc

2569
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:49,199
um I observed a curious a curious thing

2570
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:52,560
that on TV in Belgium at least I don't

2571
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:57,179
usually watch TV but I happen to watch

2572
01:53:57,179 --> 01:54:01,739
uh one night with my friends like a

2573
01:54:01,739 --> 01:54:05,639
generic Belgium Belgium program and

2574
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:07,400
during the advertisement

2575
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:11,880
uh period all the ads a vast majority of

2576
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:14,040
them were about cars

2577
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,500
and uh

2578
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,679
in any or in all ways they were trying

2579
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:22,040
to sell either a lifestyle the

2580
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:26,340
ecological ecological idea that new cars

2581
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:30,300
to be can be green and Etc but I was

2582
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:35,400
wondering if we might ever arrive to to

2583
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,960
to this

2584
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:39,060
um to this thinking that we should not

2585
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:42,179
be advertising this anymore as we don't

2586
01:54:42,179 --> 01:54:45,199
advertise cigarettes or I don't know

2587
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:48,139
hard alcohol on on

2588
01:54:48,139 --> 01:54:52,619
TV and in media and whether it makes

2589
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:55,940
sense or it doesn't

2590
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,560
it's an interesting thought we will

2591
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,360
actually come back to it next time but I

2592
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,520
wonder if somebody has already you know

2593
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,860
an opinion on this

2594
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:07,679
should advertising car cars or sales

2595
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:09,719
cards would be banned because it's

2596
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:13,280
but for society

2597
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:24,060
maybe I can even add to this that

2598
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:24,600
um

2599
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,940
I've been watching Belgian TV for a long

2600
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:30,540
time as I'm convention and um

2601
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:33,360
I there always used to be uh car

2602
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:36,659
commercials but in the last two years

2603
01:55:36,659 --> 01:55:39,119
um actually most of them has have been

2604
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:41,159
for SUV

2605
01:55:41,159 --> 01:55:45,719
uh cars or like there's been a bit shift

2606
01:55:45,719 --> 01:55:46,860
to

2607
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:49,560
making commercials for SUV cars which

2608
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:53,699
yeah I find really strange yeah

2609
01:55:53,699 --> 01:55:56,699
well

2610
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:59,760
um yeah I think it's it's happening and

2611
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,440
I was considering to put another graph

2612
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,540
that shows the increase of SUV sales and

2613
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:06,840
really before 2015 it was this Market

2614
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:09,960
hardly existed it really became uh a

2615
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,480
thing in the last two years at least in

2616
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:15,179
in Western Europe I think it was a

2617
01:56:15,179 --> 01:56:16,739
little bit different in Eastern Europe

2618
01:56:16,739 --> 01:56:18,600
and Russia Ukraine

2619
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:21,360
[Music]

2620
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,400
some cultural reasons also really bad

2621
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:27,600
roads and a lot of rich people

2622
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:30,060
um but um

2623
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:32,280
okay but that seems that if you tune

2624
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,260
into the mainstream culture if you show

2625
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:36,420
TV and and advertising in between

2626
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:38,400
programs the cars are still very much

2627
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,980
there well maybe not regular cars but

2628
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:44,060
more SUVs as you say

2629
01:56:44,219 --> 01:56:45,659
um

2630
01:56:45,659 --> 01:56:47,460
I think it's an interesting observation

2631
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:50,040
anybody else has some some thoughts on

2632
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,940
this or another things

2633
01:56:54,010 --> 01:56:56,580
[Music]

2634
01:56:56,580 --> 01:57:01,739
be yeah quite hard to uh prohibit the

2635
01:57:01,739 --> 01:57:04,679
advertisements if there's no uh real

2636
01:57:04,679 --> 01:57:08,520
alternative for the car for example in

2637
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:11,119
in Flanders yeah there's an extreme

2638
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:14,580
suburbanization and it's uh Mobility is

2639
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:15,659
not

2640
01:57:15,659 --> 01:57:19,380
uh not that good to get to to different

2641
01:57:19,380 --> 01:57:23,580
places such as work or Leisure so yeah I

2642
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:26,400
think first a better alternative for the

2643
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,560
car needs to be installed

2644
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,380
and and what is that alternative

2645
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:35,219
yeah maybe better public transport

2646
01:57:35,219 --> 01:57:40,380
um safer also in cities but also in just

2647
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:46,580
Town safer uh bicycle Lanes or yeah

2648
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:52,199
and yes uh yeah car sharing more if not

2649
01:57:52,199 --> 01:57:54,420
really an alternative for cars it may be

2650
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:57,900
less having each household having two

2651
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:00,599
cars or three

2652
01:58:00,599 --> 01:58:02,280
um and in Belgium there's also the big

2653
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:03,900
problem of

2654
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:08,340
the the companies having giving cars to

2655
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:10,260
their employees

2656
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:14,159
uh which has spark debates a lot

2657
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:18,060
yes in Belgium in fact most of new cars

2658
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:19,199
being installed on so-called company

2659
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:21,119
cars which uh

2660
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:23,400
paid for by the I mean for those who

2661
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:25,860
don't know who are not from Belgium

2662
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:26,520
um

2663
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,320
it's a system that allows you to get a

2664
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:30,300
free car from your employer it's

2665
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:32,340
basically a way of giving somebody a

2666
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:36,659
salary bump because it's tax-free and

2667
01:58:36,659 --> 01:58:38,699
um bonus if you increase somebody's

2668
01:58:38,699 --> 01:58:40,440
salary they would have to pay tax on

2669
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:42,179
this you don't pay a tax on the company

2670
01:58:42,179 --> 01:58:44,040
car

2671
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:45,119
um

2672
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:48,480
but then why do you think people uh well

2673
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,580
because it seems that

2674
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:52,980
I described some some kind of a shift of

2675
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:55,139
thinking and some reflection on these

2676
01:58:55,139 --> 01:58:56,520
environmental problems that the

2677
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,679
corporate uses and all the nuisances

2678
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:00,480
that it causes but it seems that people

2679
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,820
still drive why why do you think they

2680
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:05,480
still do it

2681
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:09,020
why is it still so popular

2682
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:13,739
and maybe I can refer to this I think

2683
01:59:13,739 --> 01:59:15,719
there's like the

2684
01:59:15,719 --> 01:59:17,219
um exactly what you were talking about

2685
01:59:17,219 --> 01:59:18,960
before like

2686
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,400
um certain

2687
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:21,300
um

2688
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:24,300
yeah so

2689
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:28,440
factors which which cannot be

2690
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:29,820
um

2691
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:33,000
um somehow persist before like like

2692
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,860
urban planners cannot

2693
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:36,960
um no sorry

2694
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,480
um like certain things you cannot plan

2695
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:42,000
and like it's an individual approach

2696
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
that the symbol of the car is still like

2697
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,460
deep in the mind of a lot of people that

2698
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:52,080
they it's like a day um routine that you

2699
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:54,960
get into your car and drive to the to to

2700
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:58,199
your working place and I think that's

2701
01:59:58,199 --> 02:00:01,440
exactly the problem that it's certain

2702
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,599
um changes in the transportation system

2703
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:06,179
cannot be made by other planners or

2704
02:00:06,179 --> 02:00:09,960
transport Transportation planners but

2705
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:13,260
um have to be made in in in the society

2706
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:17,699
or in the in symbolism of of a car so

2707
02:00:17,699 --> 02:00:20,580
it's a mindset it's a cultural

2708
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:23,280
habitus sociologists would say it's a

2709
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:26,400
way of imagining how we interact with uh

2710
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:29,159
with the world or how we move through it

2711
02:00:29,159 --> 02:00:30,599
but I think the example of the company

2712
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:33,239
car also shows that something else it's

2713
02:00:33,239 --> 02:00:36,000
not exclusive but it's also a policy

2714
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,800
that there are a number of political

2715
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:40,619
instruments that make it uh

2716
02:00:40,619 --> 02:00:44,699
I mean if we go with that uh

2717
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:47,219
simplified logic of making a rational

2718
02:00:47,219 --> 02:00:50,699
economic choice uh how do I go and where

2719
02:00:50,699 --> 02:00:52,679
do I go it simply makes this decision

2720
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:55,619
more more simple more rational it makes

2721
02:00:55,619 --> 02:00:58,440
sense to have a car from an economic

2722
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:00,659
perspective as well in in many cities

2723
02:01:00,659 --> 02:01:03,060
still

2724
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:05,119
um

2725
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,179
yeah if I could maybe add to that also

2726
02:01:09,179 --> 02:01:11,280
that's structurally there is a lot of

2727
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:13,679
government as well like policy support

2728
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:16,020
not just like the company cars but as we

2729
02:01:16,020 --> 02:01:18,900
saw these days with the crisis I think

2730
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:22,139
we try to boost like not to to allow our

2731
02:01:22,139 --> 02:01:24,540
automobile manufacturing automobile

2732
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:25,920
companies

2733
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:27,719
um Cromwell because of the employment

2734
02:01:27,719 --> 02:01:29,639
opportunities that they provide so

2735
02:01:29,639 --> 02:01:31,920
strangely enough actually some of the

2736
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,619
financial

2737
02:01:33,619 --> 02:01:36,599
loss or some of the new

2738
02:01:36,599 --> 02:01:39,000
um funds for to stimulate the economy

2739
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,520
have been directly towards I think

2740
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:44,820
Individual Car ownership purchase of

2741
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:47,159
different people so I think when you

2742
02:01:47,159 --> 02:01:49,800
when you see that it's

2743
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:53,159
it's a big imperative a big push if if

2744
02:01:53,159 --> 02:01:56,340
you can have access to that as well yeah

2745
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:58,739
I think same goes with Aviation I don't

2746
02:01:58,739 --> 02:02:00,300
know if you follow that on the news but

2747
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:03,119
one of the first maybe not first but one

2748
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:04,679
of the early discussions in terms of

2749
02:02:04,679 --> 02:02:08,340
some economic package for stimulating

2750
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:10,380
the the economy in Belgium was towards

2751
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:13,020
the the aviation companies the argument

2752
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:14,940
being is that these industries create

2753
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:18,659
jobs and these jobs are valuable

2754
02:02:18,659 --> 02:02:20,159
well

2755
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:21,599
um I'm not saying whether this is right

2756
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:22,170
or wrong

2757
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:23,400
[Music]

2758
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:25,920
but the argument is there that these

2759
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,360
modes of Mobility also produce

2760
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,679
employment

2761
02:02:28,679 --> 02:02:30,360
I think that relates a little bit to

2762
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:32,699
this aspect of Economic Development this

2763
02:02:32,699 --> 02:02:34,800
anticipation that you know since this

2764
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,599
way of moving around our cities or our

2765
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:39,000
Societies in general uh is very

2766
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
important for the economy to to to keep

2767
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,699
growing to keep persisting

2768
02:02:44,699 --> 02:02:46,080
um

2769
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:47,940
are there any other comments maybe from

2770
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:50,820
some people who haven't spoken yet

2771
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:52,800
you have some thoughts

2772
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,139
some comments

2773
02:02:55,139 --> 02:02:56,639
um I was also thinking about security

2774
02:02:56,639 --> 02:02:58,380
like

2775
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:01,320
um the the use of the car is still

2776
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:04,080
um like yeah done by many because maybe

2777
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,179
it's the last like it's the most secure

2778
02:03:06,179 --> 02:03:09,360
way of moving around in some cities and

2779
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:11,880
also like I'm thinking and like as a

2780
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:13,739
woman as a girl like moving around the

2781
02:03:13,739 --> 02:03:16,260
city at night usually like um I mean not

2782
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:17,940
here in Brussels because I don't have a

2783
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:20,520
car here in Brussels like back home

2784
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:23,219
um I would go by car at night

2785
02:03:23,219 --> 02:03:25,560
um just because like

2786
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:27,480
um yeah it's not very secure to move

2787
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:30,119
around uh with like public transport or

2788
02:03:30,119 --> 02:03:32,219
even by bike so I would say like yeah

2789
02:03:32,219 --> 02:03:34,500
it's it's a matter of security as well

2790
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:36,060
and

2791
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:39,000
um it's more like a structural problem

2792
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,119
uh to change so I guess more steps have

2793
02:03:42,119 --> 02:03:44,099
to be taken in that sense

2794
02:03:44,099 --> 02:03:47,520
yeah it's a very good point it existed

2795
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,460
before the pandemic and now it's uh it's

2796
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:53,699
become even more more of an issue so

2797
02:03:53,699 --> 02:03:56,880
early data uh shows us that uh

2798
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,619
especially the upper middle class or

2799
02:03:58,619 --> 02:04:00,540
upper class people have uh have bought

2800
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:02,699
themselves a new car to uh to separate

2801
02:04:02,699 --> 02:04:05,159
themselves from the from the danger of

2802
02:04:05,159 --> 02:04:07,440
interacting with others earlier this

2803
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:08,880
danger would be related to maybe

2804
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:11,520
criminality or general lack of safety

2805
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:14,159
especially at night especially for women

2806
02:04:14,159 --> 02:04:17,159
perhaps but now this sense of danger and

2807
02:04:17,159 --> 02:04:18,480
the car is this kind of bubble that

2808
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:19,980
allows you to separate yourself from

2809
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:23,159
whatever danger Society holds it's it's

2810
02:04:23,159 --> 02:04:25,750
even stronger

2811
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:26,280
[Music]

2812
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:27,080
um

2813
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:30,480
I think what's important also uh we will

2814
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:33,659
talk about this a lot uh next time is

2815
02:04:33,659 --> 02:04:35,580
that this goes very differently for for

2816
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:37,020
different people I mean it sounds very

2817
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:40,500
obvious but uh whether you look at the

2818
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:42,060
situation from a class perspective or

2819
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:43,560
from a gender perspective or from a

2820
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:45,199
racial perspective

2821
02:04:45,199 --> 02:04:48,420
I think all these three uh also age is

2822
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:50,219
very important all these four then apply

2823
02:04:50,219 --> 02:04:51,599
in Brussels very much

2824
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:54,480
uh the way that people arrive to a

2825
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,580
decision in terms of why they go where

2826
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:58,980
they go and how they go it's it's very

2827
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:00,960
different from class to class from

2828
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,699
gender to gender and

2829
02:05:02,699 --> 02:05:04,080
etc etc

2830
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:07,500
so this homo economicus Paradigm is

2831
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:11,159
extremely problematic there but so is I

2832
02:05:11,159 --> 02:05:14,699
hope I will convince you of that this uh

2833
02:05:14,699 --> 02:05:18,239
direct critique uh of the car because uh

2834
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:19,320
different people use the car for

2835
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:22,199
different reasons and not always it's a

2836
02:05:22,199 --> 02:05:24,360
individual choice but also there are

2837
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:28,199
some structural issues at play uh also

2838
02:05:28,199 --> 02:05:32,520
indeed some cultural inertia some ways

2839
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,380
of being that were installed and

2840
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:38,520
promoted for decades which now we are or

2841
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:39,540
some of us

2842
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:41,840
living in City centers

2843
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:44,520
are critical of but things have things

2844
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,320
are quite different if you're uh from a

2845
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:47,520
different class and living in different

2846
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,159
areas of the city

2847
02:05:50,159 --> 02:05:52,080
um I don't mind taking one more or two

2848
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:54,540
more questions but it's eight already so

2849
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:56,400
we are very free to leave if you want to

2850
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,139
I don't want to take too much of your

2851
02:05:58,139 --> 02:06:00,320
time

2852
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:03,860
well

2853
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:05,940
great

2854
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:07,860
um I'm glad this is working from the

2855
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:09,960
technical perspective at least

2856
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:15,139
yeah I will uh I will see you next week

2857
02:06:19,460 --> 02:06:22,560
that we have program I know that in

2858
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,440
covet times Well it's not happening but

2859
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:28,440
no no I was I was told that uh yeah yeah

2860
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:30,300
I was uh

2861
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:32,219
was trying to do it but uh it's not

2862
02:06:32,219 --> 02:06:34,020
possible unfortunately I wish we could

2863
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:36,119
and do it the idea is for those of you

2864
02:06:36,119 --> 02:06:37,920
who are in Brussels next semester but

2865
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,560
all of you will be right

2866
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:41,480
um

2867
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:43,340
well

2868
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:45,420
I mean

2869
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:46,980
um let's say

2870
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:48,060
[Music]

2871
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:49,860
well we don't know of course what

2872
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:51,179
happens in a few months but the idea is

2873
02:06:51,179 --> 02:06:54,719
that if in Spring we are more or less to

2874
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:57,060
you know more into face-to-face meetings

2875
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:58,860
than we do the Excursion then

2876
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:01,380
we imagined with David bus and others

2877
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:02,699
what would happen if we meet with 40

2878
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:05,159
people and try to keep distance I think

2879
02:07:05,159 --> 02:07:06,659
this would uh you know we would hit

2880
02:07:06,659 --> 02:07:08,699
YouTube very quickly I think trying to

2881
02:07:08,699 --> 02:07:10,080
walk through the city in this

2882
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,040
arrangement

2883
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,719
so

2884
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:15,119
no and also in December I mean it would

2885
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:17,639
be very strange uh from my experience in

2886
02:07:17,639 --> 02:07:19,500
the end we would definitely try to keep

2887
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:21,780
together just to keep warm it's it's

2888
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:24,420
cold right so

2889
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:26,159
um we will do that in Spring I hope it's

2890
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:29,099
a nice Excursion uh from what I've heard

2891
02:07:29,099 --> 02:07:31,619
uh people usually enjoy it

2892
02:07:31,619 --> 02:07:34,520
um even though it's only about transport

2893
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,780
but yeah uh

2894
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:38,820
uh I'm sorry about that I wish I wish we

2895
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:40,920
could do it yeah this is the reality

2896
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:43,520
we're living in

2897
02:07:44,099 --> 02:07:46,440
um I hope you care of a great rest of

2898
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,840
the week I'll see you all next week uh

2899
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:50,699
the links are there so it seems that

2900
02:07:50,699 --> 02:07:52,560
everything is clear and working so

2901
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:54,719
that's brilliant

2902
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:57,960
um enjoy and have a good have a good

2903
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:59,400
week

2904
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:01,260
thank you for the like John thank you

2905
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:03,500
very much

# 9 Critical perspectives on urban transport

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
should be recording automatically but

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,100
well it is now thanks for thanks for

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,039
reminding me so double rationality the

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,980
rationality of the discipline uh which

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,719
is taken as uh some kind of

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,199
um Fields deriving from Natural Sciences

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,140
alluding to laws of physics which

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,600
apparently help to understand where

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,960
people go how they move around the city

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,060
um and the rationality of the of the

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,800
people themselves of the users of

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,020
passengers drivers who make rational

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,200
economic choices in terms of where they

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,520
go how they go

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,879
how does this apply to the city uh well

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,340
basically the city's approach as a clean

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,820
slate so it's social political spatial

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,480
complexity it's seen if it is seen it's

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,640
seen as an obstacle to these principles

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,980
of rational planning

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,079
um if it's not seen then basically well

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,079
this planning is applied as if on a

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,160
clean slate

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
which

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
in this particular slide maybe this is a

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,900
bit of an exaggeration these are plans

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,180
from the cocusier who was really very

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,340
back then it was called bold or

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,159
courageous in terms of proposing to

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
actually demolish all's uh neighborhoods

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,979
or whole cities to to give way to this

32
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,200
rational modern planning

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,540
um but a lot of these planning

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,799
principles have been applied and I'm

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,240
sure that you've been to maybe even

36
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,400
lived in cities where

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,720
um whole neighborhoods if not whole

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,159
cities have been designed according to

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,020
this principle of rationality speed

40
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,920
modernity that of course focused on or

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,979
framed the car the private vehicle as

42
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,920
the ultimate most rational most

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,200
liberating mode of of Mobility mode of

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,640
transport

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,500
we also arrived last time to this

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,659
growing reflection starting from the

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,479
1970s and then through the 1980s and

48
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,840
1990s on many different problems related

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,720
to car and automobility so there's wider

50
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,500
social uh phenomenon related to to

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,440
massification and commodification of of

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,360
private cars

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,220
so a lot of social issues have been

54
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,260
raised and primarily environmental

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,020
issues have been raised with regards to

56
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,220
automobility with regard with regard to

57
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,260
the car and to be frank I think in a lot

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,440
of Transport debates whether in Academia

59
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,860
or an activism or in policy in Brussels

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,360
I think is quite apparent in many other

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,580
Belgian cities too this is where we are

62
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,800
this is still very much the dominant

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,260
Paradigm in terms of how policy is Being

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,000
Framed and how research is being done

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
Harris are considered to be something

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,840
detrimental to the quality of urban

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,140
space to a living

68
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,459
be it because of its environmental

69
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,920
impacts the pollution noise accidents

70
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,379
that it causes uh it's a very dangerous

71
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,819
mode of transport

72
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,920
for those of course who are outside of

73
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,220
the car and Clash collide with it or

74
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,019
it's spatial Footprints all right so the

75
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,780
the spatial uh impact of the the

76
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,400
infrastructure the amount of square

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,500
meters that have to be devoted to this

78
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,819
particular amount of Transport in order

79
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,120
for it to uh to be able to uh to move

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,920
around the city so I'm thinking here

81
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,599
about all the urban motorways the

82
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,819
parking lots Junctions and all that that

83
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,560
has to be present in the city for the

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,319
car to uh to be a a valid uh useful of

85
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,060
of moving around

86
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,340
so this is what we did last time

87
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,720
uh

88
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,940
a bit of an well not an interlude but

89
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,400
what happened also uh throughout the

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,379
1970s and 80s is that in the global

91
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,019
North at least in so-called developed

92
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,239
countries such as Belgium but also

93
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,239
across the pond in North America cities

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,599
have uh entered into a post-foldist era

95
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,920
and I'm sure this has been covered a lot

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,659
by David and probably a little bit by

97
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,879
Nick and here I'm going to focus much

98
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,980
more on the transport related impact of

99
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,420
that shift of course it was not

100
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,459
something that happened over a day and

101
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,099
it's difficult to tell or to pinpoint

102
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,580
when did for this cities

103
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,379
you know conclude the existence and and

104
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,299
we move to prosperity and it's more of a

105
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,700
longer process that happened over over a

106
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,858
long period of time at least at least

107
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,858
years if not decades but what's very

108
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,358
important there is that if you go back

109
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,720
to these um curves and that are somewhat

110
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,820
similar to contratives waves of

111
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,600
different Innovation waves uh 1960s 70s

112
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,820
and 80s brought first The Innovation and

113
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,340
then the massification the spread of ICT

114
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,800
technology so different modes of

115
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,419
different instruments of

116
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,419
telecommunications and also a big

117
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,380
development of Aviation of air which was

118
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,900
used both I mean of course it existed

119
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,720
already in 1930s 40s and 50s but it's in

120
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,720
the 1970s that it really became a common

121
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,419
or more common than ever way of for

122
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,580
people to move around to travel of

123
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,620
course not within the city but between

124
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,900
cities between countries and also to

125
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,880
move Goods so this really propelled uh

126
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
or gave constituted a really big step in

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,340
terms of globalizing both traffic of

128
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,639
people as and and of goods of trade

129
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,340
and that's coincided with a general

130
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,660
shift from industrial to service economy

131
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,340
ongoing supervisation of not only

132
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,280
housing but also a number of other

133
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,240
economic functions that were

134
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,800
traditionally related to memory course

135
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,199
also going to do the suburbs which

136
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,220
created a polycentric

137
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,900
mosaic-like patterns of suburbanization

138
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,880
so the suburbs were no longer these

139
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,320
residential areas from which people

140
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,300
commuted to the city center but actually

141
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,300
a lot of jobs a lot of productive

142
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,100
activity and service economy would start

143
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,139
being located in in the suburbs

144
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,340
themselves

145
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,080
uh so creating all kinds of

146
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,020
constellations which for example could

147
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,000
be called the Suburban downtowns or Edge

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,620
cities that comes from the work of

149
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,960
famous geographer and Soldier uh

150
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,639
analyzing the development of Los Angeles

151
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,479
in the 1980s and the 1990s

152
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,280
the Paradigm of this could be seen I

153
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,020
mean or the symbol not a paradigm of

154
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,360
this transformation could be seen in the

155
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,000
particular space or a type of space of

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,060
an airport if back in the 1970s as you

157
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,800
can see in this image the airport would

158
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,560
be a very functional Place uh a place of

159
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,160
arrival a departure and a rather small

160
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,819
area would be devoted to the airport

161
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,860
this over of course a number of decades

162
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,139
has completely changed so you see that

163
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,759
development of one of the most important

164
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,740
efforts in the world's Hip Roll which is

165
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,139
the airport of Amsterdam

166
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,780
uh what's very important here is that

167
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,880
the airport it's no longer an addition

168
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,699
to the city but actually increasingly a

169
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,000
central space around which or in

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,520
relation to which the city develops so

171
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,380
what kind of a city a city what kind of

172
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,660
an Oakwood city has uh has a

173
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,160
repercussions in terms of what kind of

174
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,259
class of investors and productive

175
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,960
activities it can attract to have an

176
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,900
importance in airport Hub is

177
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,240
increasingly only well it's already a

178
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,860
well-established point of the agenda of

179
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,039
open marketing of Urban Development

180
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,780
um and airports are no longer just

181
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,580
airports I mean you can see here in the

182
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,039
slide that around sleepwell we've got a

183
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,720
number of other activities so a business

184
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,440
district office spaces uh residential

185
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,880
Hotel so it is uh sort of neighborhood

186
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,639
in itself that is built around the the

187
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,139
airport

188
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,699
um itself

189
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,639
this is important why is it why is it is

190
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,660
important

191
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,819
well there was a number of things at

192
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,199
stake here but the most important thing

193
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,199
here is that this change of typology of

194
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,580
different spaces in relation to these

195
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,240
different modes of travel so coming into

196
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,699
telecommunications Aviation means that

197
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,319
the travel contents are becoming more

198
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,419
and more complex

199
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,819
um the globalization of world economy

200
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,919
and the centrality of the city and this

201
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,199
global economy means that there is a

202
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,599
number of productive activities jobs

203
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,020
basically that happen 24 7. it's the

204
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,180
Paradigm of going to uh I mean of most

205
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,460
people going to work at eight o'clock

206
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,720
nine o'clock in the morning and then

207
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,160
going back in the afternoon of course

208
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,259
it's a lot of people still do that but

209
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,000
there is plenty of jobs that happen

210
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,280
overnight that require

211
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
transport infrastructure that is

212
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,380
provided in places and at times that

213
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,839
we're not needed there was no demand for

214
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,039
in the past

215
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,719
so in our

216
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,520
in us this

217
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,279
making of those Urban economy more

218
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,740
flexible uh and more precarious has

219
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,240
repercussions in terms of making

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,040
transport and Mobility also much more

221
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,320
flexible or the demand for much more

222
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,779
flexible way of moving which of course

223
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,880
means that it's way more complicated and

224
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,220
way more difficult to design Transport

225
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,040
Systems than before since people move if

226
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,140
we can put it in a very blunt way in in

227
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,820
much more complicated ways than ever

228
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,740
before at very different times in a

229
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,660
different stasis just to give you an

230
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,100
example I mean traditionally

231
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,959
reserventence of the airport of Brussels

232
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,300
will be considered of course as a very

233
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,160
important space that'll have to be

234
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,080
connected to the city primarily to

235
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,839
receive passengers there and from and

236
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,760
increasingly a random area of the city

237
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,260
and I think you covered that with David

238
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,779
White's uh in quite in detail there's a

239
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,640
whole Hub of business and productive

240
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,459
activity which of course attracts a lot

241
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,260
of middle class workers who would go to

242
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,440
that area daytime but then the

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,940
development of ongoing development of

244
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,220
the city sorry of the airport means that

245
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,300
there is

246
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,220
um high demand for workers in logistics

247
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,839
for example who have to arrive at the

248
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,160
airport at three o'clock in the morning

249
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,260
which raises questions in terms of

250
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,640
provision of public transport through

251
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,260
that area a lot of these people would

252
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,760
for example reside in working-class

253
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,260
neighborhoods of Brussels

254
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,580
so

255
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,920
um there is a question with a nighttime

256
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,600
public transport should be provided to

257
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,100
that area

258
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,660
um but then and get a current Paradigm

259
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,820
of public transport by Time by night

260
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,100
time in Brussels this mode of Transport

261
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,779
is mostly provided for leisure

262
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,180
activities so for people who go out

263
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,760
enjoy cultural activities or socializing

264
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,500
and then want to go back home at two

265
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,779
o'clock three o'clock in the night but

266
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,040
not for people who actually need to

267
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,920
reach their their jobs at that time of

268
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,279
the of the night in very let's say weird

269
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,060
or previously not so present areas such

270
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,640
as the the savitem area or other

271
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,839
localities around us that hack okay

272
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,399
so having said this uh so a quick

273
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,440
reminder of what we did last time and a

274
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,240
quick

275
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,579
uh cover of this shift from for this to

276
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,320
post four days in Paradigm of uh of

277
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,820
Urban Development and its repercussions

278
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,120
for for the cities uh and and transport

279
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,200
in them

280
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,899
here's what we are going to do today so

281
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,500
we will discuss uh perhaps have a little

282
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,060
discussion actually I will be trying to

283
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,920
ask you some questions and engage in

284
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,779
some exchange here

285
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,240
what is the sustainable Urban transport

286
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,100
and different sustainable perspectives

287
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,459
on imagining transport and developing it

288
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,800
and then we will engage in a progressive

289
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,440
deconstruction of that Paradigm and

290
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,600
analyze what we can identify as critical

291
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,339
approaches to transported Mobility that

292
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,899
built on a number of perspectives that

293
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,260
you already heard from David and bass

294
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,200
and Nick about

295
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,320
all right last week what you had to do

296
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,120
and many other things that an article

297
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,320
you had to do as students of Master

298
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,779
nerve and studies and geography is to

299
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,000
read a paper by David bannister on on

300
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160
sustainable Mobility paradigm

301
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,240
um I wonder where they used to remember

302
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,640
anything from that paper this is not an

303
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,740
exam so don't worry if you remember

304
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,959
things that were not exactly you know

305
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,399
um I mean what you remember isn't

306
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,079
exactly carry clear maybe things a

307
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,540
little bit fuzzy but

308
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,040
does something ring a bell from that

309
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,540
from that piece

310
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,220
um if you if somebody asked you today

311
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,500
before this particular lecture what is

312
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,899
sustainable Urban transport what comes

313
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,060
to mind does anybody want to uh want to

314
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,500
share their thoughts on this with us

315
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
that's called awkward silence

316
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,480
foreign

317
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,980
does anybody remember what banister says

318
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,339
in this paper

319
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,800
that's all right

320
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:39,000
okay well

321
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,420
it's not how to put it it's not the most

322
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,579
um fascinating paper I've ever read but

323
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,339
for transport geography it's absolutely

324
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,899
fundamental so this is really something

325
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,800
that

326
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,200
you see being referred to for when was

327
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,220
it written 2011 right so nine years in

328
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,260
this is still a very very important

329
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,380
piece of writing that really defined

330
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,440
almost a whole field of research and

331
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,720
transport and Mobility

332
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,660
what's important here and this is

333
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,399
important when we keep thinking about

334
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,680
the last lecture in the neoclassical

335
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,100
Paradigm of uh of developing transport

336
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,220
is well could be summarized in a number

337
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,399
of points so if you think about this uh

338
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,600
image that I showed you from the Corpus

339
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,700
here and this modernist rational

340
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,740
approach to planning cities around

341
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,500
transport or

342
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,839
here the assumption is that we have to

343
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,100
ultimately break with this

344
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,079
monofunctional planning separation of

345
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,260
functions keeping residential areas on

346
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,779
the one side and productive activity

347
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,600
jobs offices industrial activity on the

348
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
other side and then Leisure somewhere in

349
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,380
between these three in the in between

350
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,360
these two here the idea is that we

351
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440
really have to engage in planning cities

352
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,240
that are much more mixed which different

353
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,000
functions are

354
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,079
allocated much more closely to each

355
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,600
other why do we have to do that well

356
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,540
because this increases the possibility

357
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,120
of of engaging Less in mobility of

358
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,540
basically in moving less in the in the

359
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,860
city which has of course very good

360
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,540
implications or potentially good

361
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,620
implications in terms of the

362
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,540
environmental impact of transform

363
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,820
so the idea is that if we make cities

364
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,100
more mixed in terms of the functions and

365
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,139
on top of that more dense we might

366
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,600
arrive at the situation in which people

367
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,339
don't have to travel such far distances

368
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:30,920
or they don't have to travel that often

369
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,180
and potentially and that's the second

370
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,820
point we can also facilitate some kind

371
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,700
of a shift from the mode that we all

372
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,040
want to disappear I mean I'm thinking as

373
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,660
a sustainable Urban transport planner

374
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,519
now so the car towards public transport

375
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,959
Collective Mobility on the one hand and

376
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,160
on the other hand

377
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,680
so-called soft transport mode so walking

378
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,920
cycling to profoundly Challenge and

379
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,260
hopefully end the domination of cars in

380
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,360
in cities like

381
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,279
so this is I mean goes beyond the

382
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,360
critique of the car uh how do we maybe

383
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,100
not get rid of the car but how limited

384
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,560
how do we limit its presence well we

385
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,959
make cities more dense more mixed and we

386
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,160
make public transport and other

387
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,199
different modes of of moving around more

388
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,519
attractive

389
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,440
well of course there are important

390
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,899
cultural and social barriers to this so

391
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,000
there is some kind of social inertia and

392
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
you mentioned it in our discussion at

393
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
the end of the last lecture people are

394
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,459
used to driving the they of course have

395
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,260
been also told for a couple of decades

396
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,899
now that uh I mean buying a car is

397
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,699
something not only perfectly normal but

398
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,459
maybe in context such as Belgium or

399
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,579
Brussels a perfectly rational choice

400
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,860
and also well if we follow the

401
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,600
neoclassical line I mean people make

402
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,779
rational economic choices uh so it's

403
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,639
been simply quite profitable and and

404
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,120
economically reasonable to have a car so

405
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,279
to instigate some kind of a social

406
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,139
transformation we need to pay more

407
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,360
attention to how people make these

408
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,579
choices and this perspective starts

409
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,040
adding a number of psychological

410
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,779
analysis for example and factors to this

411
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,940
to this equation so it's not only an

412
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,940
economic uh choice and some kind of an

413
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,040
economic decision that people make when

414
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,660
they take a car or some other amount of

415
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,120
Transport but there's also

416
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,779
um

417
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,300
different social aspects psychological

418
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,180
aspects that impact and make an impact

419
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,339
on this and this means that sustainable

420
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,560
Urban transport Scholars planners

421
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,500
activists are much more attentive than

422
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,120
the neoclassical colleagues in terms of

423
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
how people engage in different

424
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,560
Lifestyles why do they practice certain

425
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,740
travel behaviors it is called which also

426
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,259
leads to a lot of studies on inclusion

427
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,940
in transport or exclusion from it on

428
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,399
accessibility two different transport

429
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,560
modes or accessibility through transport

430
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,019
to different Urban functions which

431
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,139
progressively over the you know 1990s

432
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,320
2000s and up to today questions this

433
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,300
Paradigm of of seems to question this

434
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,420
Paradigm of top-down planning and and

435
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,319
policy so this figure of some

436
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,199
neoclassical rational expert is not

437
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,640
necessarily

438
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,040
um well it's still there but it's not

439
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,740
the only god-like figure that makes

440
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,559
these like decisions in terms of you

441
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,179
know here we will build a Motorway and

442
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,699
he will build some residential uh

443
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,339
neighborhood etc etc

444
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,859
where is the city in this in this

445
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,780
Paradigm or in this perspective

446
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,299
well the city is

447
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,299
um

448
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,100
an outcome of the sustainable transport

449
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,039
Paradigm it's a sustainable transport in

450
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,500
the sustainable city is is an in it's an

451
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,240
integral component

452
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,780
um of what uh what Jacob's called good

453
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,000
City on what David bannister in the

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,940
article you had to read uh identifies as

455
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,620
Urban viability vibrancy Vitality there

456
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,820
was a lot of uh words about a lot of um

457
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,059
writing about uh the the attractiveness

458
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,919
of the city or its livability or its

459
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,140
resilience that's a bit more recent so

460
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,419
there's a lot of keywords which identify

461
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,419
uh a city as

462
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,080
um

463
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,660
ultimate benefactor of the shift towards

464
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,640
sustainable transport so there is talk

465
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,100
about maintaining economic performance

466
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,900
of the city since well we remember that

467
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,660
neoclassical Scholars have essentially

468
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,460
tried to theorize this relationship

469
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,440
between economic growth and development

470
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,360
of Transport so it's still there we move

471
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,820
away from the car but the cities still

472
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,320
continue to develop the economies

473
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,360
continue to thrive we achieve social

474
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,240
cohesion so presumably everybody is on

475
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,980
board there is no Losers of this process

476
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,600
it's all of course environmentally

477
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,900
friendly we arrive at Urban environments

478
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,720
which provide Better Health environments

479
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,580
or facilities well not facilities but

480
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,200
are basically more healthy for the for

481
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,480
the residents and all this in the spirit

482
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,940
of participation so everybody is on

483
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,380
board and and

484
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,020
this political process does not exclude

485
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,860
anybody well if you think about this uh

486
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,460
I mean I'm no my intention is not to be

487
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,320
ironic here I think that

488
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,120
um by the way the slide I mean the image

489
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,919
here is from uh this visualization of uh

490
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,960
in Brussels so the central uh

491
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,480
Avenue that crosses the Pentagon from

492
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,520
north to south and if you remember how

493
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,280
this this street looked like some years

494
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,600
ago

495
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
um this kind of vision is something that

496
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,500
we might all you know want to subscribe

497
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
to I mean who doesn't want to live in a

498
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,919
city that is all these things

499
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,660
economically performing socially

500
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,340
cohesive environmentally friendly I mean

501
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,919
it's a perfect City it sees

502
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,799
um the problem is well before we move to

503
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,940
the problem

504
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,039
um there are a few

505
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,020
I'm sure that this rings a bell and I'm

506
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,220
sure that you know a lot of different

507
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,620
practices which are trying to policies

508
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,260
practices that are trying to achieve

509
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,580
these things to make the city more

510
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,200
environmentally friendly in terms of its

511
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,120
transport economically performance

512
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,520
inclusive cohesive and whatnot

513
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,660
it's what examples you know so this is

514
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,059
maybe an easy question to answer

515
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,799
compared to the previous one

516
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,020
does anybody know any practices of

517
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,120
sustainable transport basically is it my

518
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,360
question

519
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,840
because you can see that the

520
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,080
construction of bike lanes for example

521
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,520
yes very much so I mean it's a

522
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,440
promoting a different mode of Transport

523
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,880
than the cars right one of the soft

524
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,460
modes cycling so we absolutely yes

525
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,880
what else

526
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,419
I see it enter

527
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,340
um I'm living uh

528
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,100
here next to it about one kilometer of

529
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,320
the Opera in antrop

530
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,419
and um

531
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,240
two years ago it was uh

532
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,220
for um

533
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,559
passengers

534
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,260
very difficult to cross the roads and

535
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,280
now

536
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,780
um they made a tunnel

537
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,020
and they made a huge space for um carbon

538
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,340
transport and and passengers so

539
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,320
you can see now and then

540
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,480
a big difference

541
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,799
um clear division from from what's

542
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,520
what's usual until the 90s so you mean

543
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,000
that there was less space of well of the

544
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,840
car infrastructure

545
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,179
by public transport

546
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,039
yeah

547
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,799
the the car was was still

548
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,740
um like they say it was the boss

549
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,799
um right presence of the of the car was

550
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,320
was very important we seen our shift

551
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,880
there

552
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,000
and this shift basically consists of

553
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,620
creating some infrastructure for

554
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,299
pedestrians and public transports to

555
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,720
somehow public schools now for a meeting

556
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,200
place uh for the Opera okay okay

557
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,220
to this

558
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,320
um can you hear me yeah I just just

559
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,299
right before the lecture I I read about

560
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,280
Paris with a more

561
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,220
um restrictive policy about banning

562
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,460
um your parking spots in cities in in

563
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,400
order to achieve the 50 minutes uh City

564
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,640
the so-called so-called Fatima City yeah

565
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,700
right so restricting restricting car

566
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,799
infrastructure or transforming it into

567
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
different type of infrastructure for

568
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,179
either either different modes or for

569
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,820
pedestrians so creating some Urban space

570
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,159
okay

571
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,520
what else maybe developing both rapid

572
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,280
transits for example in America

573
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,860
yeah does everybody or is this somebody

574
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,480
who doesn't know what bus Rapid Transit

575
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,600
is

576
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,360
it's a funny question to ask to a screen

577
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,720
but oh no don't tell me that it's

578
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,460
switched again I have to stop sharing

579
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,500
your screen but perhaps you want to

580
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,480
explain what bus Rapid Transit is

581
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,620
because I'm sure that there is somebody

582
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,299
who doesn't know

583
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,179
I can help in case

584
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,580
your definition is not perfect well what

585
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,840
it has

586
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,960
yeah yeah you know what I have as an

587
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,440
example is these lanes that the just for

588
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,919
bosses so they're developer a rapid Lane

589
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,159
that it will only go for buses so it's

590
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,020
supposed to work better around the city

591
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,820
yeah

592
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,039
yeah it's essentially creating separate

593
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,640
lanes for for buses but what's quite

594
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,380
specific about this or quite particular

595
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,760
is that it's

596
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,760
um kind of imitates or replaces an

597
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,260
underground system so a Metro system

598
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,539
which

599
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,700
is of course very expensive to build so

600
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,159
the idea is that instead of engaging in

601
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,720
all this digging and creating this very

602
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,360
costly and an invasive infrastructure

603
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,799
you can just create some separate lanes

604
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,140
for the buses and have an efficient

605
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,880
public transport system which is Metro

606
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,960
like

607
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,900
and that's I want to say common but uh

608
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,900
well a lot of cases first emerge in in

609
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,520
the global South right so in South

610
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,220
America and then in South Africa

611
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,440
um but there are also cases in in global

612
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
North in Western Europe

613
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,179
okay there is a lot of these different

614
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,520
policies and a lot of different

615
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,720
um

616
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,820
a lot of different uh practices and

617
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,900
ideas it seems so let's quickly go over

618
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,000
I mean let's let's try to put them

619
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,340
together into some kind of coherent uh

620
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,820
typology of different things that cities

621
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,039
can do in order to make this transport

622
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,380
more sustainable so the first thing is

623
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,059
to tackle the problem right so if the

624
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,400
problem is the car then how do we deal

625
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,500
with the car well we can either improve

626
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,860
the technology of the car and this means

627
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,220
um reducing emissions making it

628
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,260
contaminate the air a little bit less so

629
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,960
cleaning the engine technology

630
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,299
substituting for of petrol diesel

631
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,700
vehicles by electric vehicles or biogas

632
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,640
or whatnot uh creating the con I mean

633
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,500
changing the construction of cars so

634
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,860
that they cause less casualties in in

635
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,780
case of accidents right so this is

636
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,280
something that today we take for granted

637
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,220
that cars have these um crash zones and

638
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,620
crashes are being done safety tests but

639
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,480
this was virtually non-existent in the

640
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,520
1970s or 80s

641
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,320
so that's one thing so basically it's

642
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,940
trying to make the car a better vehicle

643
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,200
for the city

644
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,480
well here in the immediate problem is

645
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,659
that I mentioned that last time uh among

646
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,659
the type of vehicles that see a number

647
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,779
of sales go up most I mean most rapidly

648
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,179
in last two or three years are SUVs so

649
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,520
the sports utility vehicles which are

650
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,980
basically these massive jeep-like uh

651
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,840
cars which are extremely dangerous for

652
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,120
pedestrians and if you also turn to one

653
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,360
of the most important or marketized

654
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,000
inventors of Transport technology Elon

655
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,039
Musk I mean it's a guy who does electric

656
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,320
cars but also if you paid attention to

657
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,940
that I don't know if you know if you

658
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,980
notice that in the news I think it was

659
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,200
early this year or last year that he

660
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,020
produced this massive truck uh like

661
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,760
American style you know pickup truck

662
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,700
which has not been tested in terms of

663
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,559
its impact on pedestrians in case it

664
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,900
actually clashes with one but there is

665
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,880
on the one hand the industry tries to

666
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,919
reinvent the vehicles to make them more

667
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,840
safe and environmentally friendly on the

668
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,039
other hand there is still a push for

669
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,919
creating gigantic vehicles with simply

670
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,500
cannot achieve that with the size and

671
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,539
the you know its audience or the

672
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,220
audience is not simply looking for this

673
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,159
okay so that's the car another thing

674
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,380
that of course can be done is uh to

675
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,000
restrict the accessibility for the car

676
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,480
uh to the to the city as a whole or to

677
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,620
its different

678
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,220
um areas specific zones right so we can

679
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,919
for example impose these restrictive

680
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:01,440
pricing instruments such as congestion

681
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,100
charging or Powers which was stolen in

682
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,500
Dutch which was very recently announced

683
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,720
in Brussels but it existed in in several

684
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,460
other

685
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,720
Belgian cities in one form or another

686
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,059
for for quite a while now

687
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,700
um we can think of reducing physically

688
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,500
the space for the car so basically

689
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,559
making uh roads more narrow so so

690
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,900
cutting some Lanes reducing the number

691
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,440
of parking areas and then uh as it was

692
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,960
mentioned uh earlier replacing this

693
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,880
infrastructure is replacing the space

694
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,940
with other users so opening this space

695
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,500
to for example pedestrians or

696
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,659
non-motorized traffic creating these

697
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,640
so-called pedestrian zones or shared

698
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,720
spaces and here you have one from London

699
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,100
in this slide and also the famous

700
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,720
congestion charging scheme in London

701
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
which means that in a specific Central

702
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,700
area of London you pay 12 pounds to

703
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,600
enter every time you you do that right

704
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,760
okay

705
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,740
what other things can be done to tackle

706
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,380
a lot of Mobility well of course if we

707
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,720
want the presence of the car to go down

708
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,700
we need to propose some alternative to

709
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,799
the car our obvious alternative is

710
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,200
public transport and here sustainable

711
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,960
perspectives on transport basically uh

712
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,820
keep emphasizing the importance of

713
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,840
increasing the quality of public

714
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,100
transport of increasing the

715
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,279
accessibility of public transport

716
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:25,380
across the urban or Suburban space and

717
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,080
indeed fast Rapid Transit is one common

718
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,360
example of how this can be done actually

719
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,020
quite inexpensively also the

720
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,279
reinstallation of urban trumps and many

721
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,679
cities in the global North that got rid

722
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,320
of the tram uh to create space for the

723
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,480
car if you remember my slice from from

724
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,700
last time that's what partly happened in

725
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,760
Brussels in the 1970s it's a very common

726
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,740
way it was a very common phenomenon

727
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,200
common phenomenon sorry in France where

728
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,299
a lot of cities Trump's Trump network

729
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,700
was quite simply dismantled so here

730
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,340
since the 1990s 2000s we see The Return

731
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,279
of the Trump Urban funicular so creating

732
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,380
these cable cars plenty of other modes

733
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,720
basically of public transport and also

734
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,279
promoting the notion

735
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,740
of multi-modality right so creating

736
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,539
different options for users so that they

737
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,059
don't have to Simply choose between the

738
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,320
car and something else but there's

739
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,899
something else is a variety of different

740
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,059
options from which one can choose and

741
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,980
depending on where they go with whom

742
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,460
what they feel uh like like using in a

743
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,779
particular moment of time what

744
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,120
corresponds better to the behavior do

745
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,159
they to their lifestyle right if we if

746
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,779
the lifestyle and behavior is what we

747
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,520
pay attention to much more than before

748
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,179
um and then finally what's important in

749
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,000
this portfolio of different solutions or

750
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,340
tools if you will is reducing the need

751
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,960
to travel right so I mentioned already

752
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,000
that here the idea is that we make

753
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
cities more dense more mixed so perhaps

754
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,279
we don't have to travel so often and so

755
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,460
far

756
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,220
and in planning or in geography the idea

757
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,760
here is to progressively link Urban

758
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
Development with transport development

759
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,000
so the idea of Transit Oriental

760
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,980
transport oriented development

761
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,559
emerged within this Paradigm so for

762
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,140
example fostering some activities some

763
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,640
development around the development of

764
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,559
new Metro stations or Railway stations

765
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,200
or whole transport corridors a little

766
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,580
bit like what I showed you last time

767
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,620
with Copenhagen right the finger the

768
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,360
five finger plant which was one of the

769
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,240
first ideas of linking transport

770
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,059
development and Urban Development

771
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:34,980
um and many other things that's well

772
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,080
quite frankly I'm much more interested

773
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,059
in in sharing with you the critique of

774
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,940
all this than than this itself because

775
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,700
this is very easy to find and there's

776
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,380
plenty of different Publications on this

777
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,020
I mean basically if you follow any of

778
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,779
these uh websites which deal with or

779
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,399
well these are called magazines these

780
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,279
days that follow uh Urban policy City

781
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,640
lab the Atlantic fox or whatnot I'm sure

782
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,260
that you know more than I do I mean this

783
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,760
is what they say I mean this is what

784
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,580
they promote a lot right so the car is

785
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,299
the problem so anytime a big Northern

786
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,820
also in the global South uh this is

787
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,340
picked up a little bit but anytime any

788
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,720
important city does something in terms

789
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,179
of curbing automobility

790
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,640
um this is very often picked up by this

791
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,340
kind of media and hails as a radical

792
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,039
intervention as a radical step to to

793
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,559
reinvent Humanity to give cities back to

794
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,299
the people to make cities more

795
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,059
sustainable green attractive and etc etc

796
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,340
now I'm not saying that this is all bad

797
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,100
and that this is uh you know problematic

798
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,720
in itself but there is a number of

799
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,760
critical questions that answers critical

800
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,620
geographers really need to be asking

801
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,240
about these practices because they quite

802
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,559
simply

803
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,720
um well they are they are not really

804
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,700
taking full stock of the complexity of

805
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,679
cities that they're being applied in

806
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,120
for one

807
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,980
so

808
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,740
um well the first immediate problem is

809
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,200
that the word sustainability or the term

810
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,779
sustainability has already been picked

811
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:07,020
up by the industry the Paradigm that

812
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,159
sustainability in principle wanted to to

813
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,860
criticize and to have some critical

814
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,480
Cutting Edge over

815
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,100
so for instance the the oil industry and

816
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,620
the car industry both claim to be

817
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,179
extremely sustainable these days right

818
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,399
in terms of how they produce soil and in

819
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,020
terms of how they produce vehicles I

820
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,460
mentioned already this idea of

821
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,620
Reinventing the car so it's a more

822
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,860
sustainable mode of travel in in cities

823
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,080
but the deeper problem is that

824
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,059
and I will show that in a moment that

825
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,100
the kind of questions that sustainable

826
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,620
Urban paradigm

827
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,659
um asks about the city and the solutions

828
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,419
that it tries to bring are essentially I

829
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:51,779
mean they can only reveal some transport

830
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,720
reality to a point so it's very quick I

831
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,039
think that we can reach some kind of a

832
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,240
wall

833
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,120
um and this debate between let's say the

834
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,159
neoclassical engineers and economists

835
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,159
and the anti-car proponents of

836
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,620
sustainable vanities it's not a very

837
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,120
productive one

838
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,880
and very importantly for this course and

839
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,559
for you is I don't know Urban

840
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,179
geographers urban planners of the future

841
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,399
the relation between transport and the

842
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,860
urban in this debate is very it's very

843
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,440
weak so conceptually but also

844
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,820
empirically

845
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,320
um this kind of thinking about

846
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,179
transported Mobility simply does not

847
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,340
tell us a lot I think about the city

848
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,120
which is why we're here two nights

849
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,820
right so so let's deconstruct it and

850
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,100
explore some critical stuff about it

851
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,159
basically so

852
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,380
I wonder whether you can already pick up

853
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,260
some critique of this from Elena and her

854
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,039
colleague

855
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,399
I'll be starving with the readings today

856
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,140
does anybody remember something from the

857
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,679
reading for today

858
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,720
um I do

859
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,980
it's been a week since I read it

860
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,299
but uh

861
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,260
um I know that she uh has like

862
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,219
identified two main principles of

863
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,780
critique

864
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,520
which is first that the Alternatives

865
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,300
that are being proposed by um the

866
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,119
automobile industry and no specific

867
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,820
plans they are not very

868
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,599
like sufficient in reducing the uh out

869
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,000
to mobile impact

870
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,199
um in in certain cases you can you can

871
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,960
say if I uh say something wrong and then

872
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,000
secondly

873
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,159
um

874
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,000
well it's it's sort of a very exclusive

875
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,820
uh sometimes discussion I think but uh

876
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,520
yeah it's not very present anymore but I

877
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,980
would like to pose another question for

878
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,200
that paper it kind of upset me in a way

879
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,920
oh yeah

880
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,760
yeah if we're at it like uh I basically

881
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,460
I liked her way of like introducing her

882
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,200
thoughts and like structuring the paper

883
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,540
but I was a bit like put off just uh

884
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,300
methodologically uh in the way that she

885
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:27,020
uh links empirical evidence that she

886
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,380
produced herself to theory that is

887
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,060
oftentimes very theoretical and like

888
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,760
um based on uh very uh personal beliefs

889
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,359
and attitudes which I like also support

890
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,359
in a way but sometimes I found that did

891
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,000
make her arguments less striking and I

892
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,800
was just wondering because we are like

893
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,900
still in the beginning of all of our

894
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,680
like uh Urban critical research careers

895
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,500
uh how that is to be done

896
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,940
uh

897
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,700
if you have an answer to that

898
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,440
I don't know I mean I don't have an

899
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,079
answer to that question

900
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,300
um well I would agree with you that

901
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,859
maybe methodologically this is not the

902
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:19,500
strongest paper uh it's an analysis of

903
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,300
plans and it's not very clear exactly

904
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,740
what she's maybe done with this and

905
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,079
maybe it's true that her conviction is a

906
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,760
little bit stronger than her empirics in

907
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,140
this particular paper

908
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,619
um I picked it because it summarizes a

909
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,180
few things a little bit better than than

910
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,480
others but I really like what she what

911
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,940
she what she does even though the best

912
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,859
work that she's done is in French I

913
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,079
think which makes it not accessible to

914
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,240
everybody here

915
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,140
um

916
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,760
but yeah I think your first point in

917
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,380
terms of what's you know what's in the

918
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,380
article it's it's spot on it's also

919
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,380
there in the title I mean uh she may be

920
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,800
uh it's again she risks uh being maybe a

921
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,960
little bit uh engaging in some kind of

922
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,900
exaggeration right it's not every single

923
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,880
sustainable Urban transport policy that

924
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,980
leads to the processes that she

925
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,460
describes but there is a tendency for

926
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,359
these policies to create some

927
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,740
inequalities

928
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,680
and for the politicizing the debate

929
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,820
so um it's not exactly clear who these

930
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,220
policies are supposed to be for they are

931
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,520
these obvious a little bit again in this

932
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,859
kind of neoclassical uh Direction

933
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:32,280
rational tools of now dealing with uh

934
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,220
with the car is the problem right so in

935
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,320
fact the power relations in transport or

936
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,700
in transport policy have not really

937
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,280
changed is just that the focus has

938
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,160
shifted significantly and now

939
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,720
um this is what the planners are doing

940
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,220
as opposed to what they were doing in

941
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,420
the 1970s and 80s

942
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,220
um let's dive into this

943
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,780
whoops uh great so what are the and

944
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,300
that's my um individual of how to put it

945
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,180
my personal top five of the reasons why

946
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,160
sustainable Urban transport Paradigm is

947
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,099
not exactly the the you know doesn't

948
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,079
give you a complete view of the

949
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,880
relationship between transport and the

950
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,700
and the city and and also with some I

951
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,160
think quite practical theoretical

952
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,579
empirical uh recipes for how to get out

953
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,380
of this uh roadblock pan unintended so

954
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,599
the first issue with with a lot of the

955
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,400
riding on sustainability is that it's

956
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,260
still very much focused on technology

957
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,180
so there is a lot of attention given to

958
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,760
technological solutions where social and

959
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,900
political Innovations and some bottom up

960
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,579
political activity organization

961
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,820
engagement of people as political agents

962
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,280
not just the consumers and customers

963
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,500
that have to be now convinced to shift

964
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,300
from one mode to another from the car to

965
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,880
something else this is not so present

966
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,000
and uh well this comes from the from the

967
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,540
guru himself Elon Musk who is um despite

968
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,400
of course some obvious critique it was

969
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,099
his personality and and how he carries

970
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,980
himself in media he still is

971
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,339
um very much the hope for many in terms

972
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:15,000
of transitioning from carbon heavy modes

973
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,099
of Mobility to electric vehicles which

974
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:18,900
according to the industrial are the

975
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,820
thing of the future so according to Elon

976
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,320
Musk

977
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,180
um as he says I think public transport

978
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,820
is painful it sucks why do you want to

979
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,900
get on something with a lot of other

980
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,220
people that doesn't leave where you

981
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,780
wanted to leave doesn't start where you

982
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,660
want it to start doesn't air doesn't end

983
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,160
where you want it to end it's a pain in

984
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,380
the ass and so that's why people like

985
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,180
individualized transport that goes where

986
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,859
you want and when you want

987
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:45,119
so the idea idea is not to engage in

988
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,920
collectivizing transport for example and

989
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,160
making this a more common service or a

990
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,260
more common experience to break not only

991
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,540
the Paradigm of dependency on fossil

992
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,300
fuels and the car but the dependency on

993
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,800
individual transport making this

994
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,040
basically a less individual activity

995
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,260
which is a social political activity as

996
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,660
well no to the country here the idea is

997
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,520
to develop a better technology within

998
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,320
the Paranormal individual transport and

999
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,180
Elon Musk I mean he's doing a lot of

1000
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,359
things but one of the other things in

1001
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,040
Tesla and the produced production of

1002
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,040
electric vehicles that he does is

1003
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,560
um boring tunnels on the Los Angeles to

1004
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,079
basically create some parallel Motorway

1005
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,000
system if we can call it this way that

1006
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
bypasses congestion so actually the

1007
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,280
focus here while

1008
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,440
um might apparently be on making trans

1009
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,140
more sustainable it is essentially to

1010
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,880
solve congestion which is an extremely

1011
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,800
as I explained last time neoclastical

1012
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,619
formulation of the problem

1013
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,099
another issue and that's from Elena's

1014
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,980
paper and but I think it's not from the

1015
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,300
one that you had to read for today but

1016
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,220
from another thing that I that I learned

1017
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,339
from here is this focus on on

1018
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:02,760
the individual as the not only well how

1019
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,859
to put it not only is the source of a

1020
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,020
number of Transport problems but also as

1021
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,060
a as a solution to to address these

1022
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,920
problems right so

1023
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,940
the idea here is that essentially we can

1024
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,520
convince people to change the habits to

1025
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,320
change the lifestyle related to

1026
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,079
transported mobility and in this way we

1027
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,760
can solve a number of issues related to

1028
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,359
to this uh to this field of of open

1029
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,680
Planning of urban policies

1030
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,680
um

1031
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,920
which means that within the sustainable

1032
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,240
Paradigm

1033
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,040
um a lot of policy makers a lot of

1034
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,920
Transport stakeholders would uh rather

1035
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,720
than engage in the politics of Transport

1036
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,339
they would engage on the pedagogy that's

1037
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:48,060
related to it so it's suddenly the

1038
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,760
challenge is to make sure that people

1039
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,520
engage Less in behavior that is

1040
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,500
identified as bad behavior for example

1041
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,380
driving or living in the suburbs flying

1042
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,859
around and switching to what is

1043
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:03,780
considered to be good type of behavior

1044
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,880
positive behavior so cycling around

1045
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,220
walking living in a city center living

1046
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,160
in these dense mixed urban areas that

1047
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,079
don't require that you engage in

1048
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,020
mobility and so much

1049
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,880
and while this of course is not a

1050
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,800
problem in itself I mean it's good to

1051
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,339
think of why would people

1052
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,560
um stick to particular ways of moving

1053
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,200
what's very uh detrimental I think to

1054
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,180
the debate and to ultimately solving

1055
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,700
some issues related to transport

1056
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,900
is

1057
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,240
um putting these different ways of

1058
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,619
moving and different behaviors related

1059
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,619
to movement in a coyote where clearly

1060
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,260
there is a moral component so this good

1061
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,880
and bad behavior I think this is

1062
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,339
something that can actually antagonize

1063
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:48,900
people against one another rather than

1064
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,839
try to think of Transport problems as

1065
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,420
common societal problems thus issue

1066
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,400
number one and issue number two is that

1067
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,680
in this discussion about individual

1068
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,180
behavior

1069
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,579
um engagement with analyzing and then

1070
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,440
ultimately addressing structural causes

1071
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,660
behind behind transport and Mobility is

1072
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,480
not so present so if we focus on on the

1073
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,640
question why would people drive

1074
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,980
um and why would people of for example

1075
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,319
even specific ethnicity or gender or

1076
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,079
class drive more than others

1077
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,640
um it is very important to also

1078
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,680
understand what is the structure uh

1079
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,359
behind this what is the the general

1080
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,819
policy that allows people to obtain

1081
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,760
access to uh to a vehicle that allows

1082
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,520
that are of car infrastructure which

1083
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,839
very often and that's the case

1084
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,940
definitely in Belgium it's often

1085
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,940
absolutely free to use with no taxes to

1086
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,720
to use motorways or with cheap parking

1087
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,920
etc etc

1088
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,980
so this perspective is

1089
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,020
um in itself not a problem to look at

1090
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,000
you know why people engage in particular

1091
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,339
type of behavior and not other

1092
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,720
um but it's very important to also

1093
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,980
understand the structures behind this

1094
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,440
what Elena also writes a lot about and

1095
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,020
many others as well but as I said I'm

1096
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,339
really quite convinced by by her writing

1097
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:09,119
um

1098
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,880
is the uneven geography that is being

1099
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,040
produced by these different uh

1100
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,359
Sustainable Solutions

1101
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,020
somebody's asking a question in the chat

1102
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,640
so let me read that so maybe there's

1103
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,200
something in between for example

1104
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,380
self-driving cars and apps like uber

1105
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,000
um will be able to create smaller

1106
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,260
vehicles that can be shared as public

1107
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,800
transport so in a sense in between but

1108
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,540
in between of

1109
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,280
in between what

1110
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,980
and between private uh I mean including

1111
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,380
individual transport and Collective

1112
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,720
transport you mean

1113
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,300
Rudy do you want to explain whoever you

1114
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,260
are

1115
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,260
foreign

1116
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,520
hello

1117
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,040
Rudy are you with us

1118
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,540
I hope you didn't just write the comment

1119
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,980
and left

1120
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,020
maybe the connection is not very good on

1121
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,880
your end

1122
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,020
um

1123
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,560
well yeah I mean clearly in in recent

1124
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,720
years there's been a rise of uh of

1125
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,700
expectations towards this shared

1126
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,980
Mobility modes right so so a number of

1127
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,140
practices which allow you to get access

1128
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,420
to seemingly collectivized transport

1129
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,760
like uber I mean essentially you don't

1130
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,400
own the vehicle but it's just a not even

1131
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,900
a phone call but a tap on your phone

1132
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,520
away

1133
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,319
um

1134
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:33,900
but there is a number of uh there's a

1135
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,520
number of issues with this so there's a

1136
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,079
question whether this actually replaces

1137
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,500
uh individual transport

1138
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,420
um so do people have less cars because

1139
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,819
Uber is expanding in this city if we're

1140
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:47,400
focusing on Uber in this instance

1141
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,020
um there is also a lot of studies that

1142
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,640
show that Uber actually adds to

1143
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,460
congestion so there is the more Uber

1144
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,619
develops in the city or it's

1145
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,000
um counterparts or different other

1146
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,079
competitive platforms left in China

1147
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,640
there was a huge company called DD that

1148
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,099
essentially does what Uber does

1149
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,380
um so the more these companies develop

1150
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,400
in your city the more the how do you

1151
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,480
call it well the total number of

1152
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,260
vehicles the the car stock increases

1153
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,460
which means and that's a problem in a

1154
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,560
lot of Chinese cities you basically have

1155
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,980
more traffic jams so these cars are in

1156
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,240
traffic all the time they keep looking

1157
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,819
for customers they have to be mobile

1158
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,680
um which means that you add to the

1159
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,960
problem you try yourself which well then

1160
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,599
you try to yourself again adding more to

1161
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,339
these shared platforms

1162
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,680
and also the big issue with Uber if we

1163
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,079
are focusing on this for a moment is

1164
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,339
that the working conditions of course

1165
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:44,220
are quite quite terrible so the idea

1166
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,980
there is that essentially there are

1167
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,240
exceptions to this but in most cities

1168
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,339
where Uber operates

1169
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:51,839
um workers are not really workers

1170
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,839
they're contractors

1171
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,160
which means that they very often go in

1172
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,780
debt to actually get the vehicle that

1173
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,040
they're driving that they have to pay

1174
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,560
back to Uber because it's offering also

1175
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,660
leasing services this means that they

1176
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,740
work very long hours unlike regular taxi

1177
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,900
drivers that have to actually clock in

1178
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,940
and out this is much more regulated in

1179
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,339
terms of how they work for what amount

1180
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:16,260
of time and also what knowledge of the

1181
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,660
city they have I don't know how often

1182
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,160
you've taken Uber in your life but it's

1183
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,040
often the case that these drivers are

1184
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,079
exploring the city alone I mean they

1185
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:28,440
just learn as they as they drive which I

1186
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,359
understand they might come from a very

1187
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:31,800
difficult situation that this is the

1188
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,900
only way for them to get access to a

1189
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,079
more or less decent way of making money

1190
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:39,420
but there's a question of safety there's

1191
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,720
a question of Ethics in terms of

1192
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,880
um inviting such a practice in in our

1193
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,720
cities

1194
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,819
so there are a lot of expectations for

1195
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:49,859
these platforms and indeed there is a

1196
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:52,079
question does this maybe sit between

1197
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,880
public transport Collective transport

1198
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,700
and individual transport but uh

1199
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,440
um I would say that these hopes are

1200
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,839
still not really fulfilled

1201
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:01,800
um

1202
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,540
okay that was a bit of the digression

1203
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,040
let's go back to uneven geography of

1204
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,780
sustainable transport

1205
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,300
so what is the problem here

1206
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,819
um more often than not the application

1207
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:14,900
of the sustainable tools different

1208
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,700
policies infrastructural measures to

1209
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,579
deal with Mobility

1210
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:23,880
uh especially quite exclusive what does

1211
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,500
it mean well

1212
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,380
on the one hand it often happens that a

1213
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,760
lot of these measures are applied in a

1214
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,260
specific area of the city and more often

1215
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,599
than not this is the central Urban core

1216
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,060
which has to be saved from the car in

1217
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,660
which the the car has to limit its

1218
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,839
presence which in no way contradicts uh

1219
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:45,839
or prevents further maintenance at least

1220
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,160
if not developing a further

1221
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,960
infrastructure for the cars in more

1222
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,060
peripheral areas so you can think of

1223
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,859
cities in which in the city center

1224
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:54,540
you've got

1225
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,579
um restrictive parking regulations

1226
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:58,200
you've got a lot of pedestrian areas

1227
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,359
it's simply not easy to drive around

1228
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:02,700
public transport is definitely a more

1229
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,040
logical thing to to do to use to get

1230
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,020
into but the further you go to the

1231
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,579
suburbs the more

1232
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:09,200
um

1233
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,460
multi-lane streets or highways you see

1234
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,740
or actual proper highways a lot of

1235
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,140
parking lots all the infrastructure that

1236
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,839
actually well belongs to the 1970s and

1237
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:20,400
1980s

1238
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,940
and that is I think a situation not only

1239
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,980
in Belgium or and Brussels specifically

1240
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,819
but

1241
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,440
in a lot of these cities that are

1242
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,940
supposedly

1243
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,060
have achieved um a great level of of

1244
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,740
policy in terms of dealing with with

1245
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,339
Khan so Copenhagen Vienna a lot of

1246
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:41,520
French cities that both these uh tram

1247
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,579
renewal programs uh as long as you are

1248
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:46,319
in the central part of the city this all

1249
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,859
looks uh very coherent and very well

1250
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:51,480
inverted Commerce good from a

1251
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,280
sustainable transport perspective but

1252
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,720
the farther you go from the city center

1253
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,640
the more actually the more cars you see

1254
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,500
the more it actually resembles the

1255
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,540
problem that these policies try to try

1256
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,800
to solve

1257
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,920
another inequality is of the vertical

1258
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,339
kind meaning that it often happens that

1259
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:08,880
um

1260
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,619
the investment in these kind of

1261
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,839
sustainable tools comes at the cost of

1262
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:14,880
putting the car infrastructure

1263
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,300
underground so and you can think of any

1264
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,940
case in which pedestrialization of of an

1265
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,579
urban Avenue or Boulevard means that the

1266
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,079
cars have to be put underground or

1267
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:27,780
parking lots of the other highways

1268
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,900
and this is often the the problem in in

1269
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,359
the so-called car-free cities the cities

1270
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,859
that are often picked up by

1271
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:37,079
International media and and praised for

1272
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,359
having addressed head-on the domination

1273
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,040
of the cars and dealt with the problem

1274
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,760
of automobility

1275
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,660
um

1276
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,440
a specific tool that's that I think we

1277
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,900
can see this and even geography in ah

1278
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,000
there's a question in the chat an

1279
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,040
example for Rudy's question from Berlin

1280
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,180
great

1281
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,680
um let me go on with the congestion

1282
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,599
charging while you're discussing Uber in

1283
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,260
the chat uh this is perfectly allowed so

1284
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,540
an example of this and even geography

1285
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,339
can be found in in congestion charging

1286
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:11,220
which is one of the let's say

1287
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,619
um yeah one of the most uh classical

1288
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,079
tools of of sustainable transport

1289
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,760
Paradigm in terms of you know limiting

1290
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,920
the presence of the cars the idea is

1291
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,619
simple it came from Singapore in the

1292
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,440
1970s it was developed as a very

1293
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,880
neoclassical uh tool of planning

1294
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,220
basically a problem with congestion and

1295
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,020
the idea was to convince to encourage

1296
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,200
drivers to use the car off-peak so to

1297
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,720
minimize the the traffic the traffic

1298
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,359
jams in morning and and afternoon or

1299
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,520
evening peak hours

1300
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,059
and progressively this tool or perhaps

1301
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:47,280
with the shift of philosophy behind

1302
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,780
transport from the neoclassical to

1303
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,200
sustainable uh perspectives this tool

1304
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,180
um was picked up by by the sustainable

1305
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,700
narrative and now it not only allows to

1306
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,440
solve congestion but actually it allows

1307
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,240
to limit the presence of the car in the

1308
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,460
city which of course supposedly makes a

1309
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,020
positive impact on on the urban

1310
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,280
environment

1311
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,800
and this tool has been put in place in

1312
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,660
in a number of cities in Europe

1313
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,540
so you here see pictures from Oslo but

1314
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,000
actually this exists in pretty much all

1315
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,180
uh Norwegian cities and towns so a

1316
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,579
system of tolling Gates

1317
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:22,800
um in London which is probably the most

1318
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,599
important or the most known case in

1319
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,240
Europe in Milan but you also have

1320
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,940
similar policies and instruments in

1321
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,460
Stockholm in Sweden and then recently

1322
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,800
also in Brussels announced with a lot of

1323
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,140
pump and Circumstance this idea that now

1324
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,319
it will cost the user the end user money

1325
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,099
to enter with a car Mica to to the

1326
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:45,599
Brussels capital region

1327
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,059
so

1328
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:50,040
while this gets a lot of attention and

1329
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,760
and this policy is discussed as a very

1330
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,480
uh as a very efficient uh tool in terms

1331
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,980
of limiting the presence of the car in

1332
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,020
cities

1333
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,059
um there is questionable evidence I'm

1334
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,520
not saying that this policy is uh is is

1335
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,680
a bad policy or that it never works but

1336
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,579
basically it's it's supposed to uh

1337
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,680
um productive results in terms of

1338
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,920
limiting the car are not exactly there

1339
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,380
in the in the in the in the evidence so

1340
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,300
the results are quite mixed on the one

1341
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,040
hand we see that in in a number of

1342
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,500
Cities traffic of course diminishes but

1343
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,740
since it's The delimited Zone it's it's

1344
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,079
quite particular so it's not the whole

1345
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,240
agglomeration that actually

1346
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,940
um has the access to the car limited we

1347
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,180
see that the traffic often moves from of

1348
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,220
course the The Zone in which the

1349
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,660
condition charging the flight to the

1350
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,819
outer areas in London for instance it's

1351
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:46,859
quite clear that there is significantly

1352
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:49,440
more traffic around that that zone it's

1353
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,079
the same case in Madrid which uh which

1354
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,460
um essentially followed a very similar

1355
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,839
principle

1356
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,540
there is also very questionable evidence

1357
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,460
about what happens with the funds that

1358
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,900
are being raised through these systems

1359
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,880
so while very often these policies are

1360
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,640
put in place with uh this Narrative of

1361
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,559
saving the city from the car of making

1362
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,900
some kind of societal transition to to

1363
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,380
posca society in cities like Oslo or

1364
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,140
London funds from these uh from these

1365
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,480
schemes in in a way that's very clear in

1366
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,680
London maybe a little bit less

1367
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,599
transparent but at least part of these

1368
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,400
fans goes to actually maintenance and

1369
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,200
construction of car infrastructure you

1370
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,579
know it's very it's a very common

1371
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:28,500
practice to put these congestion

1372
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,099
charging areas or

1373
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:33,420
booths if you if you will to actually

1374
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,040
subsidize the construction of of

1375
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,380
specific uh transport infrastructure

1376
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,260
Road tunnel or a bridge it's it's done

1377
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,839
in a very transparent way so in a sense

1378
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,819
it's basically asking the transport the

1379
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:46,260
car user to

1380
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,420
contribute a little bit more because of

1381
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,559
course this contribution is already

1382
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,900
there through tax system to the

1383
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,119
construction uh to the financing of the

1384
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,740
construction of Transport infrastructure

1385
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,140
of cutting in car infrastructure and

1386
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,200
finally the impact of these uh of these

1387
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,319
schemes on overall quality of the city

1388
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,319
not just on air quality in a specific

1389
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:10,200
area is quite limited so

1390
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,400
um

1391
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,220
yeah I said it basically so despite the

1392
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,200
The Narrative of of these practices

1393
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,540
saving Urban environment it's not

1394
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,339
exactly clear that this is this is the

1395
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:22,319
most obvious thing to do to limit the

1396
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,000
smog in the city especially when these

1397
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,280
uh when these areas are quite uh

1398
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,220
spatially Limited

1399
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,079
the problems that immediately emerge

1400
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:33,059
from from policies like congestion

1401
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:36,000
charting is that well it leads to some

1402
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,420
social segregation right so we expect

1403
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,720
um that all people react to this uh to

1404
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,339
this policy in a similar way right they

1405
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:45,660
will reconsider whether they want to

1406
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,099
drive or not whether they want to enter

1407
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,980
into the Zone by car or not but in fact

1408
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,920
of course those who do not pay for the

1409
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,960
vehicle and in particular in Belgium

1410
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,300
this is a policy that is very widespread

1411
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,000
half of new vehicles sold in Belgium are

1412
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,680
so-called company cars which are

1413
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,960
received for free by employees from the

1414
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,540
company as a way of giving them an

1415
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,000
tax-free salary bonus basically so for

1416
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,040
these people who do not pay for the

1417
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,780
vehicle itself and often whose

1418
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,319
consumption of the vehicle gas so or any

1419
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,460
kind of fuel they put in the car

1420
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,079
insurance this is all paid by the

1421
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,180
company very often this very often

1422
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,280
basically is included in the package so

1423
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,660
the congestion charging is actually not

1424
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,579
covered by the individual it's covered

1425
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,859
by the structure that provides the

1426
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:30,059
vehicle

1427
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:32,220
um in in the first place

1428
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,440
while of course those who do not have a

1429
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,260
job who might be seeking one those who

1430
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,619
are from lower working class background

1431
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:43,859
who might also be doing very difficult

1432
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:47,040
complicated irregular trips that require

1433
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,660
entering and leaving in different times

1434
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,180
of day because they need to go to a job

1435
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,880
that that quite simply requires getting

1436
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,040
by car and I'm going back here to this

1437
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,559
example of somebody working in logistics

1438
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,500
public transport between molenberg or

1439
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,119
zavendam for example at three o'clock in

1440
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,160
the morning being simply not there you

1441
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,800
have to have a car to to reach this kind

1442
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,079
of activity to to be able to access the

1443
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,079
kind of urban function

1444
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:15,960
and then ultimately well what it does to

1445
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,800
uh to to Mobility is commodified so it's

1446
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,920
an essentially neoliberal service you

1447
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,140
pay as much as you use it's not a common

1448
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,500
system anymore you the idea is that

1449
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,359
everybody pays not according to the

1450
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:33,480
means but according to the ultimately

1451
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,339
um the price decided by the by the

1452
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:36,780
market

1453
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,339
so

1454
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:40,619
um again not to say that this is about a

1455
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:42,599
good idea but to say that there is quite

1456
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,819
simply a lot of questions a lot of them

1457
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:47,339
quite clearly related to to critical

1458
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:48,599
geography that should be asked about

1459
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,640
these these policies

1460
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,619
it's already past seven so I suggest we

1461
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:54,300
take at least five minute break before

1462
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,160
we can continue so get a little bit of a

1463
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,319
drink uh whatever it is that you are

1464
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,540
you're sipping to make through this

1465
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,160
lecture

1466
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,440
um and I'll see you back in in four five

1467
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,099
minutes all right

1468
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,900
foreign

1469
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:38,819
foreign

1470
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:41,880
okay let's try to resume

1471
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,440
I'm going to share my screen once again

1472
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,339
all right

1473
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:02,359
where are we

1474
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:05,420
all right

1475
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,780
I suppose you hear me and you see me

1476
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,859
um

1477
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:16,859
great perfect so

1478
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:20,040
continuing with uh the uneven geography

1479
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,240
of sustainable transport measures

1480
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:28,260
here you have a very simple or even a

1481
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,900
map more of a scheme that shows a little

1482
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,559
bit how this limitation

1483
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:37,559
plays out in space so Oslo I don't know

1484
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:38,880
if you've heard about that but also is

1485
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,960
one of the most

1486
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,700
um

1487
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,200
marketized cities in terms of its

1488
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,960
alleged fight against the car it's uh

1489
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,619
leading some kind of a war against the

1490
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:51,059
petrol-fueled vehicles and basically

1491
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:53,339
there is this area in the city in which

1492
01:04:53,339 --> 01:04:55,319
um to which access is not only

1493
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:58,380
restricted in terms of extra payment

1494
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,559
right so there was actually several

1495
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:03,359
layers of this congestion charging and

1496
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:06,299
then the final one is this uh Ultra

1497
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:10,440
inner city in which cars propelled by by

1498
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,380
gas or fuel are not allowed is only

1499
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,059
electric vehicles but then when you look

1500
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:16,440
at the whole agglomeration of the city

1501
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,140
it's quite clear that I mean this is a

1502
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,059
very small area so we are actually

1503
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:24,059
talking about quite specific zones of

1504
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:25,680
the city which as I mentioned are

1505
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,380
supposedly saved from the car and are

1506
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:31,559
supposed to be made more pedestrian or

1507
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:33,480
people friendly

1508
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:38,040
same idea or same limitation can be can

1509
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,020
be seen in Madrid which until recently

1510
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,799
had also quite a restrictive uh

1511
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:46,140
Mobility area this has changed with a

1512
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,640
change of political majority does not

1513
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,500
matter if it's this area still exists

1514
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,140
although the rules have have changed to

1515
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,680
some extent the idea is that Madrid

1516
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,980
which was called in worldwide media as

1517
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,200
an anti-car municipality a municipality

1518
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,660
that takes some radical measures to to

1519
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,299
limit the presence of the car in fact

1520
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:08,819
well it does so but it does so within a

1521
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:11,940
quite limited uh

1522
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,000
designated area whereas you see that in

1523
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,400
the in the general map there is a whole

1524
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,260
car infrastructure around it and

1525
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,240
multiple motorways both

1526
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,059
around and from that Central Area so

1527
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:26,460
there's a question with a automobility

1528
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,640
is actually being

1529
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,039
properly uh uh challenged or is this

1530
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:34,319
more of an urban policy that focuses on

1531
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,020
valorization of specific areas of the

1532
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,599
city and here it's you don't have to be

1533
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,660
a smart critical geographer to ask if

1534
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:45,059
this is not part of some revolarization

1535
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:48,660
strategies that try to increase rent and

1536
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,319
profit to gentrify quite simply specific

1537
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,660
areas of the city and the limitation of

1538
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,660
car traffic being part of of that policy

1539
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:00,180
to beautify the area to make it more

1540
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,700
attractive to tourists to specific type

1541
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,220
of investors

1542
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,460
while limiting mobility of of this of

1543
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,380
this kind

1544
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,440
this we've covered and here we arrive to

1545
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,440
the to the well to it to a case of of

1546
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,599
such a policy limiting presence of the

1547
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:21,299
calf the pier tonight in Brussels which

1548
01:07:21,299 --> 01:07:25,200
I'm quite sure uh all of you have uh

1549
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,319
have already experienced and and see

1550
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:31,500
so well this map you've seen quite a lot

1551
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,760
before I'm sure Brussels with its um

1552
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,160
Zone 30 so the the limitation of of

1553
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,280
speed there and the petone marked in in

1554
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,740
red uh at the moment of installation the

1555
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:47,339
biggest pedestrian area in uh in Europe

1556
01:07:47,339 --> 01:07:48,900
I wonder whether you've got any

1557
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,780
impressions of this place before I

1558
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,839
um show you my take on on or share with

1559
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,400
you my take on on what happened over

1560
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,140
there

1561
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,480
um I imagine you've been to lupiteria

1562
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,460
but do you have any

1563
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,740
uh any interesting thoughts about this

1564
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,900
do you like this place do you think it's

1565
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,680
not so great

1566
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,280
um I don't know I don't I don't have a

1567
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,460
very uh deep thought about it I don't

1568
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,500
think but um

1569
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,738
it's definitely nicer than it was uh I

1570
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:25,020
mean like I lived in the center for like

1571
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,179
five years ago or like no was it five

1572
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:29,520
years ago like longer ago but like it

1573
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,620
was really horrible like when you cycled

1574
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,738
through like downtown it was really

1575
01:08:33,738 --> 01:08:37,439
awful because like the road was just

1576
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,198
disgusting like you don't you didn't

1577
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:42,479
really want to be there

1578
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,580
um now I mean it's a bit

1579
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,920
no I I don't have the feeling it's it's

1580
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,359
very much

1581
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:49,198
um

1582
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:52,140
it's it's very true for what it is you

1583
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:54,299
know like for for like

1584
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:55,920
I don't know it doesn't really feel like

1585
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,299
a downturn it feels a little bit

1586
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,219
provincial

1587
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:00,719
um but like at least it's like I'm

1588
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,359
definitely happy with like that it's

1589
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,339
much better than it used to be like

1590
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:06,479
really

1591
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,640
like it it's it's definitely an

1592
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,620
improvement but it feels the Big City

1593
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:14,819
Vibe a bit okay for those of you who who

1594
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:16,859
didn't see it before it was changed into

1595
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:18,899
a bit of scenario I pushed a slice so

1596
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:21,960
you see in the top image uh how this

1597
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,939
street could look like on a Friday

1598
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:26,100
afternoon quite regularly so full of

1599
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,279
cars for four lanes

1600
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,698
um and then well the situation that's of

1601
01:09:32,698 --> 01:09:34,920
course pre-covered uh well I don't know

1602
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,020
I probably right now if you took that

1603
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,600
picture would be quite similar

1604
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,819
um anybody else who has some some

1605
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:43,439
impressions of how how this

1606
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,839
transformation looked like

1607
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,299
somebody who loves this somebody who

1608
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:49,560
hates this

1609
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,819
and for whatever reason

1610
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:57,480
um I agree with him because it was a

1611
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,440
place

1612
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,780
when uh when I passed when I study in

1613
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,280
Brussels where I pass with my

1614
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,360
girlfriends

1615
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,000
I don't want my girlfriend to let alone

1616
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,760
on the other place

1617
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,420
some years ago but one frustration I

1618
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,679
guess from I I followed the dope process

1619
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,080
and what I know was it was very

1620
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,500
difficult for uh Transportation like

1621
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,199
like MVB and steep

1622
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:28,260
um public transport to pass because it's

1623
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,960
the the lane was was cut

1624
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,340
um yeah so

1625
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:34,980
they wait uh wait for over two hours to

1626
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,380
go to another place when set was five

1627
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,380
minutes it was two hours

1628
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,360
so you mean it affected other modes of

1629
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,640
of of trying to not only the car but

1630
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,420
also public transport yeah yeah the

1631
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,340
victim was public transport and I guess

1632
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:53,040
in in in Brussels it's very important to

1633
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,080
when you have a Prestige project like

1634
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,020
that you need to consider all of

1635
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,400
Transport modes and not only pedestrians

1636
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,080
press each project I think also is an

1637
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,580
important uh

1638
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:09,060
also like like an element to add maybe

1639
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,920
is that it's terrible if you go by bike

1640
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,679
it's really not made for bicycles like I

1641
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,780
I tried cycling through it and I mean

1642
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,580
right now it's not so busy and it's all

1643
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,760
right but like on on on days when there

1644
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,920
is I mean there's lots of tour tourists

1645
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,780
of course lots of people use the the

1646
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,060
area so then it's just really not nice

1647
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,420
to cycle there yes I share these

1648
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,679
Impressions I mean these are not only

1649
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,739
Impressions and the fact is that and

1650
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:36,840
this area was redeveloped but without

1651
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,540
any bicycle policy in mind so there is

1652
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:42,060
basically I'm not I'm the last person to

1653
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,500
say that what was there before was great

1654
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,020
but uh you can vaguely see it on the

1655
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,460
right hand side of the top picture that

1656
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,560
there is actually a bicycle lane not a

1657
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,020
great one but there was one now it's

1658
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,840
it's simply not there uh somebody's

1659
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,940
writing something in the chat

1660
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:59,100
why do they take down the larger trees

1661
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,380
neutralization of bulovanos but I find

1662
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,080
the Landscaping quite poor well so there

1663
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,600
was a number of uh things at stake

1664
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,060
um I mean let's cover that first

1665
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,659
um

1666
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,360
it was announced in January 2014 the

1667
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,860
municipal authorities of the city of

1668
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:17,520
Brussels so the uh Mill Brussels 1000

1669
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,440
announced that they want to expand an

1670
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,120
existing pedestrian zone so you already

1671
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,739
had some streets especially it was

1672
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:26,159
complex that were not open for the cars

1673
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:27,900
and the context of that and that's quite

1674
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,640
an important thing is that there was a

1675
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,520
series of protests called under the

1676
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,440
slogan of picnic the streets a movement

1677
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,960
of uh some spontaneous Civil

1678
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,880
Disobedience basically people would

1679
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,860
occupy space that would normally be

1680
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,320
taken by cars you see that in the the

1681
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,199
picture normally a lot of cars so right

1682
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:48,600
in front of books that will be basically

1683
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,580
uh some kind of an action people would

1684
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:53,880
just sit down and enjoy the Sun and and

1685
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,520
manifest that they want uh allegedly the

1686
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,199
space to be for people

1687
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:01,199
taken away from the cars and this space

1688
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:02,640
should be freed from the Cars to make

1689
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,040
the city center for Brussels more

1690
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,060
sustainable more attractive and more

1691
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,320
livable

1692
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,840
the project is launched in June 2015 so

1693
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,820
that's when the street is closed and

1694
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,739
there is an eight month test phase

1695
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:15,719
without any infrastructural change so at

1696
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:17,520
first to go a little bit to the question

1697
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,380
of design there is no design change

1698
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,600
basically industry is closed and there

1699
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,719
is uh as as many people call it a sea of

1700
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,640
asphalt I mean suddenly you can walk on

1701
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,199
this on the street which

1702
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,420
place a little bit of course on people's

1703
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,340
imaginary that suddenly you realize how

1704
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,500
how huge this infrastructure given to

1705
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,719
the car is and and what what could

1706
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,540
happen in place of this infrastructure

1707
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,219
well

1708
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:42,780
and then progressively after this

1709
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,760
eight-month phase we see some kind of

1710
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,400
infrastructural development so an actual

1711
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,800
change of the build environment

1712
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,040
the problem there is is that well there

1713
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,840
was a quality of design that is being

1714
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,000
put into question I'm not a designer or

1715
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,679
landscaper but a lot of people have

1716
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:00,120
criticized the way that this looks like

1717
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,340
the immediate limitation is that right

1718
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:06,060
underground we've got a canal uh towards

1719
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:07,500
the end of division and we also have a

1720
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,080
metro line of pre-metro line which runs

1721
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,000
right under the the surface of the

1722
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,699
street so it's not for example possible

1723
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:17,580
apparently to put uh to put large trees

1724
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,980
over there which uh already starts you

1725
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,300
know making an impact in terms of how

1726
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,980
the space is uh space is done

1727
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,380
um well there were very high aspirations

1728
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,080
when when plutonium was was uh was

1729
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,880
announced it was not only supposed to be

1730
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,920
a classical project or According to some

1731
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,920
scholars in Brussels or even politicians

1732
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,420
it was not a transport project or a

1733
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,219
Mobility project it was an urban project

1734
01:14:41,219 --> 01:14:43,739
an urban renewal project which by

1735
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:46,620
closing this uh Paris like Boulevard

1736
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:51,020
because actually it is in its uh in its

1737
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,280
architecture very much an inspiration of

1738
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,280
Parisian boulevards the closing of it to

1739
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,980
motorized traffic was supposedly a step

1740
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:01,140
towards getting the city center or the

1741
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:05,760
city as such out of decline to put um as

1742
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,699
the mayor of Marissa meal of the of that

1743
01:15:08,699 --> 01:15:10,320
particular municipality said that

1744
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,120
Brussels the Belgian and European

1745
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,280
Capital would finally enjoy a truly

1746
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,620
Dynamic pedestrian attractive and

1747
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,960
friendly inner city like many other

1748
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,920
International Metropolis

1749
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,420
which is located in the northern part of

1750
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:27,120
of the pitonier and that's the famous uh

1751
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,040
square of famous I'm not sure but the

1752
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,679
characteristic one with the Coca-Cola uh

1753
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,520
signed that uh lights up it was compared

1754
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,219
to Times Square so the idea was to make

1755
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:39,840
this project

1756
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,760
um allow Brussels to become an

1757
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,340
international City to to create this

1758
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,020
Prestige project as it was I think very

1759
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,239
rightly said uh that would put brussels

1760
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,980
on the international map it was not just

1761
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,320
a question of you know getting rid of

1762
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,560
some some correlated nuisances

1763
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,360
and of course the amount of the plant

1764
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,679
was announced there were a number of

1765
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,360
critics so there were shopkeepers that

1766
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,100
were upset claiming that they would lose

1767
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,020
customers because people could not drive

1768
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:06,540
into the shop residents a number of

1769
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,480
Citizen organizations what were they the

1770
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,460
the issues that they would mention I

1771
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:13,320
mean the the the problems that they

1772
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,640
would that they would note about the

1773
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,320
project well they very much relate to

1774
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,179
this uneven geography that I that I was

1775
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:20,460
talking about so if you look at the the

1776
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:23,159
the map of the of the pizza in red you

1777
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:24,420
see these

1778
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:27,239
um this at that time Europe's largest

1779
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:28,679
pedestrian Zone I think now it's been

1780
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:32,460
surpassed by Ghent and and other cities

1781
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,140
um Brussels is certainly not the only

1782
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,580
city in Europe or in the world that

1783
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:39,540
engages in in these policies it is of

1784
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:42,480
course the main Central axis is cut but

1785
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,460
you see that you can actually drive

1786
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:47,940
around the the city uh the city center

1787
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:50,820
so you've got this area which is

1788
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,679
pedestrian friendly if we can put it

1789
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:54,540
this way where cars

1790
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,120
um Mobility is extremely limited

1791
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,679
um but in fact you can quite easily

1792
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:00,300
drive into the Pentagon as we call it

1793
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,520
and drive around on top of that what's

1794
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,040
also very clear is that

1795
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,960
um a particularity of Brussels which is

1796
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,239
a very high presence of underground or

1797
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:11,880
multi-story parking lots is largely

1798
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,780
unquestioned so actually

1799
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:18,060
this this day today there is about 19

1800
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,860
000 parking spots within the Pentagon

1801
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,440
within the stroke City Center of

1802
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,960
Brussels the original plan of

1803
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,739
pedestrianizing Boulevard

1804
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:30,420
included the creation of additional 1

1805
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:33,420
600 parking spots so the idea would be

1806
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:36,719
that of course we give this space to The

1807
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,540
Pedestrian and we we allow the space to

1808
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:42,120
be to be somehow reclaimed from the car

1809
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,980
but in fact the cost of this or the

1810
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,300
price of this I don't know how to call

1811
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,760
it is that we actually adds to the car

1812
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,560
infrastructure so we definitely do not

1813
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,380
want to make this less accessible as it

1814
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,020
was called by by The Cars

1815
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,300
and then as one of you mentioned there

1816
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,699
was an immediate conflict with uh with

1817
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:01,140
the public transport operator the most

1818
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,780
important one in Brussels Steven who

1819
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:07,020
basically saw uh day lines pushed out of

1820
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,940
the zone so suddenly the buses that

1821
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,460
would cross that area have to be

1822
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,320
um have to have the have to have these

1823
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,360
stops relocated which means that the

1824
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,920
accessibility for people who rely on

1825
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,420
public transport is

1826
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:22,460
uh is somewhat reduced

1827
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:26,580
right and then well that's some years

1828
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,880
later I think that picture is from 2018

1829
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,860
as far as I remember checking on Google

1830
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,360
well there was a kind of a pushback

1831
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,100
right so the cars that were at first

1832
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,960
definitely not allowed on the pitonier

1833
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,300
now in some circumstances in some

1834
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,400
situations can actually enter so you can

1835
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,380
actually see and it's taken directly

1836
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,840
from Google I didn't have to go to the

1837
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,000
pizza near and wait for a truck to enter

1838
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,760
you actually see uh of course the

1839
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,560
delivery vehicles but also public

1840
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,600
transport you see over there in the back

1841
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,159
of the of the picture I see there's a

1842
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,860
bus making a turn and entering a petunia

1843
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,960
and whenever I'm there with friends who

1844
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,580
are not from Brussels I mean they are

1845
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,860
they are really surprised to be on The

1846
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,659
Pedestrian area with public transport

1847
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,820
buses and trucks and taxi drivers and

1848
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,860
other vehicles who in exceptional

1849
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:13,380
circumstances actually can enter which

1850
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,840
questions a little bit this I mean is

1851
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,580
this a pedestrian area or is this a

1852
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:20,760
pedestrian area but without uh really

1853
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,380
getting rid of all the cars just some

1854
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,719
cars

1855
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,719
um the question of yeah

1856
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:29,880
um making this a Prestige project and

1857
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,040
putting Brussels on the map I mean there

1858
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,380
is an argument there to be made and uh

1859
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,840
and some local critical geographers have

1860
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,420
made it myself included that this in

1861
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,920
fact indeed is not a transport project

1862
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,659
in the mobility project it's clearly a

1863
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:45,780
project of rivalry valorizing this

1864
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,820
particular part of the city it's quite

1865
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:52,040
clear that as you go down southwards

1866
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,000
towards the South Station

1867
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,560
those of you who have uh who have been

1868
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,420
there I'm sure I'm sure noticed it those

1869
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,940
of you who haven't that's where we would

1870
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,340
go on the Excursion that I hope we will

1871
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,460
do in Spring you see that this is one of

1872
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,719
the poorest neighborhoods in Brussels

1873
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:12,120
one with very high youth unemployment

1874
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,699
especially where there is a very

1875
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:15,500
um

1876
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,600
precarious tightly knit but very

1877
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,659
vulnerable local economy and any kind of

1878
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:24,780
change in in built environment puts this

1879
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,960
economy on the on the huge pressure

1880
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,179
especially when the narrative around

1881
01:20:29,179 --> 01:20:32,699
clearly uh includes this idea of

1882
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:36,480
bringing big Brands tourism uh to The

1883
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,100
Pedestrian area making this place of

1884
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,340
festivities of consumption of continuous

1885
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,500
Festival

1886
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,840
um

1887
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,520
so for example the alderman for comments

1888
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,260
of the city of Brussels famously said

1889
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,300
that the objective here is not to change

1890
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,540
Mobility the objective is to recreate a

1891
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,699
commercial Promenade new brands which

1892
01:20:56,699 --> 01:20:58,080
are not yet present in Brussels are

1893
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,840
coming there is a real craze and you can

1894
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:01,860
feel it

1895
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:06,179
for the current Brussels 1000 mayor not

1896
01:21:06,179 --> 01:21:08,100
the one that had stepped down because of

1897
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,500
some corruption Scandal

1898
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,320
um the aim of the project is to keep or

1899
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,060
bring the middle class to Brussels to

1900
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:18,600
increase its tax base so suddenly the

1901
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,820
idea is not just to or not at all to

1902
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,580
actually get rid of the cars or or allow

1903
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,500
pedestrians to enjoy the some kind of

1904
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,420
newly created area it's a very Urban

1905
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,120
project in a very kind of Twisted way so

1906
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,880
the idea really is to create a new space

1907
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,800
a new neighborhood perhaps of

1908
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,920
consumption of leisure of 24 7 shopping

1909
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,460
which also of course uses or engages

1910
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:46,020
with the narrative for sustainability

1911
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,360
and livability and is somewhat related

1912
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,699
to mobility and transport but to a

1913
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:53,719
limited extent

1914
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,640
you see that there is almost only white

1915
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,100
people there like so the the people that

1916
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,420
you talked about that you see on the

1917
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,520
lower slide

1918
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,100
um like like the owners of the PC market

1919
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,980
on the owners of like 0.50 like

1920
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:16,260
basically all all people with the color

1921
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,420
they they don't they don't feature in

1922
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,520
the marketing of the of the city about

1923
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,920
the project it's a very good point of

1924
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,659
course that's a that's a very common

1925
01:22:24,659 --> 01:22:26,340
issue with these visualizations and

1926
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:29,340
imagining of uh future everyone's Super

1927
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,239
Why

1928
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,380
um but like there's there I saw that

1929
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,420
there's one black man on the right

1930
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,760
but there's also no

1931
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,679
um yeah I know people with disabilities

1932
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:42,239
very few old people yeah so yes I mean

1933
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:45,360
it's a it's not a very diverse image

1934
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,460
it's a good point and also in no way

1935
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:49,260
does it correspond to the actual reality

1936
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,060
of of that neighborhood and the kind of

1937
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:55,920
services absolutely no I mean yeah

1938
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,260
um Well we I'm really need to speed it

1939
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:01,199
up so um so we cover some important uh

1940
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,300
stuff okay until we finish no no but

1941
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,580
thank you it's a good comment there is

1942
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,960
of course all issues related to

1943
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,320
participation and and no actual change

1944
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,659
of power in in the patronier but I think

1945
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:14,699
the petone is a very good example of of

1946
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:17,219
how these sustainable ideas can be

1947
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:19,080
applied without changing at all

1948
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,940
questions of who actually decides and

1949
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:23,520
for whom uh transport policies are being

1950
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,659
made

1951
01:23:24,659 --> 01:23:27,719
so very often a sustainable discourse

1952
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:30,000
focuses when it imagines participation

1953
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,300
of users of the of the beneficence of

1954
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,699
the of the projects uh it basically

1955
01:23:35,699 --> 01:23:38,280
imagines that the the main idea is there

1956
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,260
to build consensus to inform people of

1957
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,600
the decisions that are rational that are

1958
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,120
are good practices best practices in

1959
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,739
terms of achieving sustainable Mobility

1960
01:23:46,739 --> 01:23:49,260
protecting the environment and whatnot

1961
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:52,800
so as a Flemish actually scholar has

1962
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,800
once wrote in in 2000 about the problems

1963
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,540
of sustainable transport policies that's

1964
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:00,120
the last bullet point these policies

1965
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,980
include a harmonious and conflict

1966
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,260
developing vocabulary that ignores and

1967
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:06,000
silences the deeply contested ways

1968
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,800
through which the transport system is

1969
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,960
continuously shaped and transformed and

1970
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,699
which inevitably results in a variety of

1971
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:15,080
winning and losing interest groups

1972
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:17,520
that's I think the case in many other

1973
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,679
sustainable transport projects this idea

1974
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,080
of winners and loses is swept under the

1975
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,060
carpet so in in theory everybody

1976
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,580
everybody gains but those who are

1977
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:28,920
clearly upset are not heard are not

1978
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,960
really listened to and often are mocked

1979
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,239
so again we go back to this moral

1980
01:24:33,239 --> 01:24:34,980
geography of bad behavior and good

1981
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:37,440
behavior of City shopkeepers who don't

1982
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,820
understand that this is a project that

1983
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:41,040
they will benefit from but car drivers

1984
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,679
they want to access the City versus good

1985
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,679
consuming middle class pedestrians or or

1986
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:48,540
cyclists not so more not so much in the

1987
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,520
case of application but scientists are

1988
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,580
also part of the part of the vision

1989
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:54,840
um

1990
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,659
and in all this to make this point quite

1991
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:01,199
short there is much more impact no not

1992
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,480
impact much more Focus much more

1993
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,580
emphasis on

1994
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:08,159
um the success of these practices rather

1995
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:11,460
than on the interaction with complex

1996
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:14,760
social spatial phenomena that are there

1997
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,739
in the city so there is much more focus

1998
01:25:16,739 --> 01:25:18,659
on on the transport part of Transport

1999
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:20,760
project rather than or the urban part of

2000
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,380
the purchase well we don't have a lot of

2001
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,540
time to deal with okay what could be

2002
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:27,020
done with with this hegemony of

2003
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:29,520
neoclassical on the one hand that's last

2004
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,219
week and sustainable on the other

2005
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:33,900
um that's today perspectives on

2006
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,360
transport but let's try

2007
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,820
um so what would diverse critical

2008
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,219
approaches to to transport and Mobility

2009
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,620
be on the one hand

2010
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:45,719
the new mobilities paradigm so that's

2011
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:47,940
another reading for today if you manage

2012
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,520
to read it uh that's great if not I

2013
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,440
encourage you to to have a look because

2014
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,320
that's an absolutely fundamental reading

2015
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,600
for Mobility Scholars these days I mean

2016
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,880
maybe sheller and John Aria are two very

2017
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,219
important figures in in in this field of

2018
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:05,219
geography or or any kind of discipline

2019
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:06,840
that deals with mobility and transport

2020
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,400
so here

2021
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,500
we've got a bit of a shift of attention

2022
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,239
shift of focus and

2023
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:15,600
it's really putting um it's shifting

2024
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,520
away from transport as a as an

2025
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,840
infrastructural phenomenon for example

2026
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,239
to a Mobility as a social and political

2027
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:24,000
phenomenon that's expected Builds on on

2028
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,880
diverse disciplines from sociology and

2029
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,560
political studies to ethnography and

2030
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,940
anthropology

2031
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,739
and it really explores a lot of issues

2032
01:26:31,739 --> 01:26:33,300
that cultural studies Scholars for

2033
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,400
example would deal with looking at in a

2034
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,900
number of phenomena happening in cities

2035
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,400
so different representations and

2036
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,460
meanings of Mobility Sensations

2037
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:43,440
experiencing experiences of Mobility so

2038
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,580
everything that happens on this micro

2039
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:46,860
level of what people what kind of

2040
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:49,260
practices and Norms are being being

2041
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,440
observable or being practiced in

2042
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,760
Mobility related spaces in public

2043
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,320
transport for example in these

2044
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,960
pedestrian areas and what cultural codes

2045
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,320
and Norms are related to automobility

2046
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,780
uh the problem with this particular

2047
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:07,020
approach is that well it looks very much

2048
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,120
at the micro level and whenever it

2049
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,980
engages with structural issues around

2050
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:13,739
Mobility it runs the risk of being quite

2051
01:27:13,739 --> 01:27:15,239
descriptive so it mentions a number of

2052
01:27:15,239 --> 01:27:18,120
issues race class inequality but there

2053
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,920
is not so much of a methodological depth

2054
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,020
in terms of exploring these issues and

2055
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:23,940
also it's a concept that is quite

2056
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,800
Western in a sense that it developed in

2057
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,420
the global North and then rather

2058
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:30,120
specific areas of it and it only now

2059
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,000
starts engaging with with situations

2060
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,820
with empirical context in the global

2061
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:38,040
stuff

2062
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:42,420
another approach another Avenue for for

2063
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,760
for doing critical research about

2064
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,940
transformability is building on the

2065
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,920
traditions of urban political economy of

2066
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,420
Transport right so looking at the city

2067
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,760
as a social and political construct

2068
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,000
which by no means by in no way

2069
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,179
is governed by some rational laws of

2070
01:28:00,179 --> 01:28:01,620
supply and demand like in the

2071
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:04,260
neoclassical Paradigm or which does not

2072
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:07,920
really look at people as consumers that

2073
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,800
have to be convinced to to drop or to

2074
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,719
disengage from

2075
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,420
um unwelcome or bad type of behavior and

2076
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,159
start engaging in good type of behavior

2077
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:20,400
and but rather looking at people at as

2078
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,500
at Urban inhabitants as political agents

2079
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,540
who do not make just rational decisions

2080
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,400
in terms of how they move but have

2081
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,159
political potential to to shape the the

2082
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:32,040
urban reality to change how transport

2083
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,840
and Mobility is organized in the in the

2084
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,480
locality in this city and when you look

2085
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,760
at critical urban geography and a lot of

2086
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,560
names that I'm sure you've already heard

2087
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,480
or maybe even read

2088
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,219
um from before

2089
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:46,679
David Harvey Neil Smith Edward Soldier

2090
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:50,420
they've all contributed to to

2091
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,440
conceptualizing to exploring this Lane

2092
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,139
between infrastructural development and

2093
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:56,760
social spatial distribution of public

2094
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,300
services so transport has has been there

2095
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,000
to to um

2096
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,380
to analyze the critical development of

2097
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,420
the city but

2098
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:09,780
absolutely foundational uh readings

2099
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,880
there or the first steps towards

2100
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,860
critically exploring the relationship

2101
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,840
between the transport and the City come

2102
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,520
from feminist geographers who would

2103
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,260
arrive and that's the reading that you

2104
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,159
also

2105
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:23,520
um I think was a sign for today uh Susan

2106
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,000
Hansen's work on the deconstructing this

2107
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,980
apparent divide between the home and

2108
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:30,920
work and

2109
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:35,340
attaching and women with domestic uh

2110
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,780
situations and apparently

2111
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:41,580
imagining them as less mobile Less

2112
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:44,580
Mobile beings while uh attaching this

2113
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:46,260
this Mobility potential to to

2114
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:50,159
predominantly male male subjects and

2115
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,139
male situations

2116
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:54,500
foreign

2117
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,860
part of that is to understand

2118
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:01,260
the homework relationship and homework

2119
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,659
commute which I mentioned last week is

2120
01:30:03,659 --> 01:30:06,239
is absolutely the most uh well let's see

2121
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:07,739
the foundational focus of Transport

2122
01:30:07,739 --> 01:30:10,139
geographers analyzing

2123
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:11,760
um these Mobility patterns related to

2124
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,520
the to the move from work to home and

2125
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,440
the feminist geographers already in

2126
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,280
1980s demonstrated that this uh this way

2127
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,840
of looking at transport and also this

2128
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,900
way of engaging Mobility is fundamental

2129
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,360
for maintaining uh for maintaining

2130
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,980
capitalism this is something that is the

2131
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:30,840
Cornerstone of the of the capitalist

2132
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,320
system in cities or outside of them

2133
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,139
what emerges from this is understanding

2134
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:39,840
transport and Mobility is not just uh an

2135
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,580
infrastructural phenomenon or something

2136
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,500
that has some environmental

2137
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,360
repercussions and some social ones and

2138
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,620
here I'm thinking about sustainable

2139
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:48,840
approaches to Mobility but as

2140
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,900
essentially a form of capital Mobility

2141
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:56,460
is a as a potential that is unevenly

2142
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,380
distributed as any form of capital

2143
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,440
around or across Society across its

2144
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,960
different spaces and across its its

2145
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,780
classes which leads to understanding and

2146
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,760
challenging different structures social

2147
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,060
political economic that stand behind

2148
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,400
what makes transport unsustainable in

2149
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,320
the first place so it's really asking a

2150
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,840
question why are people moving in

2151
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,460
particular ways not because they are

2152
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,320
used to a particular lifestyle because

2153
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,060
they have some cultural norms but

2154
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,739
understanding a political and economic

2155
01:31:25,739 --> 01:31:28,260
system that enables for instance the

2156
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,300
domination of the car and trying to

2157
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:32,280
address the system as a result rather

2158
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:34,260
than looking at how people can become

2159
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:37,199
convinced and or how situation in terms

2160
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:38,820
of Mobility can be changed in specific

2161
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:41,040
areas of the city it's looking at things

2162
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,960
Much More Much More broadly in much more

2163
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,540
structural ways

2164
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,699
right so

2165
01:31:47,699 --> 01:31:50,699
and here I attached bibliography to the

2166
01:31:50,699 --> 01:31:52,679
end of this to this slide so you can

2167
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:54,120
look at these different studies if you

2168
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,679
if you're interested in transported

2169
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:59,219
Mobility there is a line of of research

2170
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:00,540
that is looked at the transported

2171
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:04,159
Mobility as a way of reproducing

2172
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:07,020
existing social political economic

2173
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:09,840
interests regulatory Frameworks power

2174
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,179
relations regulated by the market on the

2175
01:32:12,179 --> 01:32:13,980
one hand and by the state and very often

2176
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:17,400
contested by from the bottom up

2177
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:18,960
there is

2178
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,239
a lot of research for some reason the

2179
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:22,679
reason the references are not showing up

2180
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:24,120
but if you're interested I'm more than

2181
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,100
happy to send you those that something

2182
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,139
strange with my slide here but there is

2183
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:30,840
an ongoing work uh already going back to

2184
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,960
the 1990s that shows how neoliberal

2185
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,600
policies that affect Urban culture

2186
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,239
provision of housing Urban environment

2187
01:32:39,239 --> 01:32:41,100
are also extremely present in provision

2188
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,280
of transport and Mobility how in in a

2189
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,199
natural transport is increasingly

2190
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:48,060
commodified and for example congestion

2191
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,219
charging that I mentioned today is part

2192
01:32:50,219 --> 01:32:53,219
of that it's turning and we could think

2193
01:32:53,219 --> 01:32:55,679
public space that's an urban Motorway or

2194
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,260
an urban street is into a commodity that

2195
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,480
has an additional price tag attached to

2196
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,179
it which as we consume we have to

2197
01:33:03,179 --> 01:33:05,580
additionally pay for depending as I

2198
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,100
mentioned not on our means but basically

2199
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:11,900
on our on our demand

2200
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,400
there is also a fundamental issue that

2201
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,280
many geographers have dealt with that is

2202
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,739
of Transport related inequality and

2203
01:33:19,739 --> 01:33:21,120
exclusion so basically trying to

2204
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,719
understand to what extent transport

2205
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,780
um enables movement of of some people

2206
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:30,659
while restricting that of that of others

2207
01:33:30,659 --> 01:33:34,679
this we will Skip and of course uh well

2208
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:37,440
it might seem very obvious today but if

2209
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,300
you look at what was being done in in

2210
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:41,040
geography in urban geography or

2211
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,840
transport geography in the 80s and the

2212
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,219
90s that was definitely not the case

2213
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:47,159
there is now a rise of research which

2214
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:49,679
looks at the questions of class and the

2215
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,659
questions of race and the question of

2216
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:53,880
gender is absolutely fundamental for

2217
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:56,159
understanding uh Transport Systems in

2218
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,980
cities and and Beyond them and one of

2219
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,600
them is this

2220
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,000
um well maybe not such a foundational

2221
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,400
reading but still something that is is

2222
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,380
very important and and and really

2223
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,900
defined the agenda of of research into

2224
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:13,500
transport for at least this decade uh of

2225
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,179
course there's there's more recent stuff

2226
01:34:15,179 --> 01:34:16,560
that also has been written but I think

2227
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:19,020
this is quite a nice uh introduction to

2228
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,719
the question of gender and Mobility

2229
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:22,860
um

2230
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:26,880
and here we see that as with the

2231
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,199
questions of race and the question with

2232
01:34:28,199 --> 01:34:30,179
class but this is something that uh was

2233
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:31,260
already quite established in the field

2234
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:34,440
already uh there is an Inseparable

2235
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,300
relationship between gender and and

2236
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:39,300
Mobility that on the one hand translated

2237
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:42,659
mobility mean development or some kind

2238
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:44,340
of opening of accessibility to different

2239
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:46,860
opportunities breaking this supposed

2240
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:50,580
Paradigm of uh the domestic female and

2241
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,500
the work-related male but actually

2242
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,320
Mobility is something that opens uh

2243
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,840
opens this time and that gender on the

2244
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,940
other hand affects travel reasons and

2245
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,980
patents in terms of the complexity in

2246
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,199
terms of the frequency and regularity

2247
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,420
and in terms of why actually people

2248
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:08,639
engage in in movement why do they

2249
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:11,340
actually move around the city

2250
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:13,739
and perhaps one critique that could be

2251
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:15,179
made about the paper that I ask you to

2252
01:35:15,179 --> 01:35:17,040
to read for today is that well it

2253
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,260
approaches women as a rather unified

2254
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:22,679
category that can be uh uh maybe not

2255
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:26,040
reduced but summarized into in in terms

2256
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:29,159
of particular Mobility patterns that uh

2257
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:31,199
half of humanity engages I think that's

2258
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:33,900
a little bit uh risky always but what

2259
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:35,040
clearly

2260
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,139
um I think is interesting in this kind

2261
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:39,540
of line of work as I said uh there is

2262
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:41,400
there is a definite follow-up and and

2263
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,260
work that explore these questions in

2264
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,060
much more detail and and it's much more

2265
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,880
fine tune to a sophisticated but we see

2266
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,500
that

2267
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,940
um without considering the agenda

2268
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:52,679
component we we basically miss the fact

2269
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:56,040
that uh in many urban contexts women

2270
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,960
engage in a completely different way

2271
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,420
with Mobility they conduct trips which

2272
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:03,480
are much more complex regular because

2273
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:05,940
they quite simply are related to uh

2274
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:08,100
diverse care related activities they

2275
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:10,620
would be much more inclined or perhaps

2276
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,780
forced to

2277
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:16,320
um to bring other people along to uh to

2278
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,260
act as drivers for other passengers and

2279
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,540
because they engage in quite simply more

2280
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:24,780
activity these than than male

2281
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:27,840
subjects in this way I'm simplifying

2282
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,239
here of course a whole lot but this way

2283
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:31,679
of approaching transport and Mobility

2284
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,800
uncovers and not only differences in

2285
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,239
terms of how people move but differences

2286
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:38,460
in terms of power relations that are

2287
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,260
there behind movement and transport

2288
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:44,340
which in my humble opinion is maybe a

2289
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:45,480
little bit there in sustainable

2290
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,639
approaches to Mobility but it's quite

2291
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:49,679
simply not pronounced enough or does not

2292
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,300
really show us

2293
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:55,500
um in full depth the the multi-level

2294
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,420
structure of power relations that are

2295
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,219
there behind behind transported and

2296
01:36:59,219 --> 01:37:01,520
Mobility

2297
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:06,120
um now what's left I'm we are we are

2298
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,219
running out of time so so I I don't

2299
01:37:08,219 --> 01:37:09,420
definitely don't want to talk about

2300
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:10,679
everything but

2301
01:37:10,679 --> 01:37:12,480
what's also important to remember is

2302
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,420
that well besides questions of Transport

2303
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:17,940
workers because so far we've we've

2304
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:20,159
basically talked mostly if not only

2305
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:22,380
about passengers transport users people

2306
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:24,420
who use transport

2307
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,400
um there's a question of Transport labor

2308
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:29,219
but also very importantly a lot of

2309
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:31,080
research done on on transport and

2310
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,060
Mobility as a vehicle for for some

2311
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:36,420
contestation discontent and struggle and

2312
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:39,060
I started these two sessions with uh

2313
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,980
with Greta tunberg with protists in

2314
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:44,040
Chile and other places and

2315
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:46,500
year in year out sometimes sometimes

2316
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,239
month and month out you see that

2317
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:51,179
transport is used as a very important uh

2318
01:37:51,179 --> 01:37:53,940
subject for a lot of for very diverse

2319
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,820
movements and social groups to expressly

2320
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:59,699
discontent with whatever it is and

2321
01:37:59,699 --> 01:38:02,280
sometimes quite directly in capitalist

2322
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:04,260
system and that's the case with G Le

2323
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:07,560
Jean and who quite symbolically would

2324
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:10,679
occupy roundabouts across rural or

2325
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:14,179
Suburban France and sometimes

2326
01:38:14,179 --> 01:38:16,139
symbolically and that's in East

2327
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:18,239
Jerusalem a Palestinian activists

2328
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,300
attacking

2329
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:22,980
light rails and kind of Tramway stations

2330
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,199
as a symbol of Israeli colonization in

2331
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,239
East Jerusalem

2332
01:38:27,239 --> 01:38:28,560
um sometimes these will be protest

2333
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,139
against uh some kind of a surface level

2334
01:38:31,139 --> 01:38:33,420
policy like the increase of public

2335
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:35,639
transport fares or policing and that's

2336
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:37,860
the case in New York City or the

2337
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:39,540
construction of of one of these

2338
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:41,699
underground parkings related to Le

2339
01:38:41,699 --> 01:38:43,620
pitonier that would add to the number of

2340
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:46,080
parking spots in the city while

2341
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,960
supposedly actually opening the city for

2342
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,239
the for the people

2343
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:54,840
this we will have to skip

2344
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,460
um the very last point that I want to

2345
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:58,080
make today I mean I I still would like

2346
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,480
to give us maybe 10 minutes for your

2347
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,420
questions and maybe some comments uh if

2348
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:06,360
you still have energy to to do that is

2349
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,520
that and that's perhaps related a little

2350
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,540
bit to this question of new

2351
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:11,280
liberalization of transforms and

2352
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,400
Mobility is that what we see uh is that

2353
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,620
despite these different

2354
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:18,780
um theoretical approaches and critical

2355
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:21,600
questions that people critical

2356
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,139
geographers are asking we see

2357
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:27,840
um a process of standardization of

2358
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,940
Transport policies so if you are a

2359
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,260
transport engineer and transport

2360
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:33,420
Economist today there is really this

2361
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,239
tendency towards

2362
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:37,980
unifying experiences of different cities

2363
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:40,620
into a portfolio of best practices which

2364
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:43,080
are then transferable from from one

2365
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,639
locality to another there's a huge

2366
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:47,580
business behind it and not only in terms

2367
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:50,400
of think tanks uh and big consultancy

2368
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,920
firms but a whole flurry of events which

2369
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,719
you can learn from

2370
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,580
experiences of others which you can

2371
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,560
learn about what your city should be

2372
01:39:58,560 --> 01:39:59,400
doing

2373
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,800
and

2374
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,940
some Scholars have engaged with that

2375
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:05,100
studying specifically the policy

2376
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:07,380
mobility of of these best practices and

2377
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:10,560
recipes in the field of urban transport

2378
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,020
but what's perhaps quite important to be

2379
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,900
to be added to this is that well

2380
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,600
the story of of policy transfer is is

2381
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:20,639
quite long I mean the the tradition of

2382
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,380
deploying Western World Views

2383
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:24,719
eurocentric Concepts and theories and

2384
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:27,780
methods in a more or less unchanged way

2385
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:30,239
in in some other geographical contexts

2386
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:33,120
in Africa Asia Latin America

2387
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,100
it's a very long story and the story is

2388
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,739
has a name in its colonization or

2389
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:39,000
coloniality

2390
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
and this is something that really is

2391
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,860
there to be done by by the future

2392
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:46,020
generation of of

2393
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:48,239
critical geographers or the transport

2394
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:49,980
geographers or Urban geographers is that

2395
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,380
of decolonizing this body of knowledge

2396
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,520
which

2397
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,920
um pretty much everything that I have

2398
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,440
referred to uh in in these two sessions

2399
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,239
comes very much

2400
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,860
um from the global North that reflects

2401
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:04,320
my own education that's something that I

2402
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:07,679
think I still have to do myself is to

2403
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,080
really start looking at the transport

2404
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,960
reality and start defining

2405
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,820
um formulating questions about this

2406
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:17,159
reality in terms of Transit Mobility not

2407
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:19,020
from our Global Northern perspective but

2408
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:21,719
also that of the South and just

2409
01:41:21,719 --> 01:41:24,540
uh again it's a it's a just a simple

2410
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,580
example of what this could mean in

2411
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,620
practice

2412
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:30,380
is looking at the question of

2413
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:32,460
informality in transport which

2414
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:34,500
traditionally uh that's a slide from one

2415
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:38,159
of these classic reports uh Commissioned

2416
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,260
I think either by un or the World Bank

2417
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:43,440
on informal transport looks at

2418
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,179
informality in transport as something

2419
01:41:45,179 --> 01:41:47,580
that means bad quality in terms of

2420
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,860
safety of passengers speeding

2421
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:52,920
environmental impact basically some old

2422
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:57,060
rickety Vehicles which uh await to be

2423
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:00,320
transformed into modern Western formal

2424
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:03,780
public transport system the the kind of

2425
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,820
we know from northern cities like

2426
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,980
Brussels or or many others in Belgium

2427
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:11,219
France or Germany or whatnot

2428
01:42:11,219 --> 01:42:13,560
um but and that's something that has

2429
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,780
been done quite recently or is in

2430
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:17,100
process

2431
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,400
um is actually understanding our

2432
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,960
experience of transport and mobility in

2433
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,880
our formal environment is very much

2434
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:26,100
something that can be informed by these

2435
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:28,739
informal experiences of the Google South

2436
01:42:28,739 --> 01:42:32,460
an example well if you ever are at wbd

2437
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:34,080
these days unfortunately this practice

2438
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,739
is on hold because of you know what

2439
01:42:36,739 --> 01:42:40,560
there is a flowery maybe not but at

2440
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,719
least a few informal transport practices

2441
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,179
that you can find in the gardeni area

2442
01:42:45,179 --> 01:42:48,239
these informal taxis vans that bring

2443
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,840
passengers informally somewhat illegally

2444
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:54,420
from the South Station to um

2445
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:56,219
Charlevoix airport so the Brussels South

2446
01:42:56,219 --> 01:42:58,980
Charlevoix airport and to Paris which ex

2447
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:02,219
well exhibit a very strong similarity

2448
01:43:02,219 --> 01:43:03,060
with

2449
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,980
many other informal practices that you

2450
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:07,440
can find in cities across South Asia

2451
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,480
Africa and Latin America

2452
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,760
and then finally while these practices

2453
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,860
of course attract whenever they do they

2454
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:15,420
attract very negative attention of the

2455
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,159
media of the police they are treated as

2456
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:19,500
something that is a illegal and be

2457
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:22,440
unfair to formal Regulators that pay

2458
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:25,199
taxes and have to operate within the

2459
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:28,080
legal framework of in this case the

2460
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,760
Brussels capital region

2461
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,100
there is and here we go back to the

2462
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:34,260
beginning of the of the of the first

2463
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:37,139
session a number of practices which are

2464
01:43:37,139 --> 01:43:38,760
proposed by the transport industry

2465
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,980
transport of Mobility industry like Uber

2466
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:43,380
or many other app-based practices which

2467
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:45,840
are essentially informal practices which

2468
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,900
try to operate in the in statuses of the

2469
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:52,020
system and somewhat legal but also not

2470
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:54,239
not to the full extent if you think for

2471
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,460
example about what Uber does to its

2472
01:43:56,460 --> 01:44:00,420
workers or what is the spatial impact if

2473
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:02,760
we can put the sway of these e-scooters

2474
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:05,639
which uh operate in public space but

2475
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:07,800
very often literally occupy the space

2476
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:10,440
the paving and and whatnot without

2477
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:13,800
necessarily making the system officially

2478
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:17,580
legal or recognized

2479
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:21,179
well here we pause our little right of

2480
01:44:21,179 --> 01:44:23,639
two sessions uh I apologize for this bit

2481
01:44:23,639 --> 01:44:25,800
of a fast-paced ending to the second

2482
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:27,960
session but we just uh I realized that

2483
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,820
we we ran out of time to discuss things

2484
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:33,179
a little bit more detailed way but we

2485
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:34,380
still have eight minutes for some

2486
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:37,080
questions if you have them uh maybe some

2487
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,060
points that you you have in your in your

2488
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:40,440
in your head right now something that

2489
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:44,659
you want to share this is the moment

2490
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:49,219
and maybe I'll stop sharing my slides

2491
01:44:56,400 --> 01:45:00,560
do you have some questions some comments

2492
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:15,199
well

2493
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:17,400
it's perfectly fine if you don't of

2494
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,980
course I mean it's quite late in the day

2495
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:21,540
I understand it

2496
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,239
and it's it's definitely a sub-optimal

2497
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:26,040
experience to do that through through

2498
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:27,119
Zoom world

2499
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:30,500
any of these platforms

2500
01:45:34,139 --> 01:45:37,739
all right Vitali is

2501
01:45:37,739 --> 01:45:40,020
asking about transport labor and there's

2502
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:41,880
also one more technical question

2503
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:44,159
well quite simply the concept of

2504
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:46,679
Transport labor looks at Labor Relations

2505
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:50,340
and conditions in transport so it's

2506
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:52,320
trying to

2507
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:53,219
um

2508
01:45:53,219 --> 01:45:55,199
change the emphasis a little bit I mean

2509
01:45:55,199 --> 01:45:56,639
if you look at the literature on the

2510
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:59,100
neoclassical or sustainable side

2511
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:03,320
and the predominant focus of

2512
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:06,840
I would really say 99 of the studies is

2513
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,780
on the passenger on the on the driver or

2514
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:13,679
the or the consumer and the question of

2515
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:16,380
what working conditions shift to

2516
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:17,940
sustainable transport involves for

2517
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:20,159
example it's very rarely asked

2518
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:23,639
and that I think can lead us into some

2519
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:25,760
dead end

2520
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,380
situations in which for example we we

2521
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:31,500
really gave a lot of Hope and we built a

2522
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,639
lot of expectations towards some

2523
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:34,920
Mobility practices like uber like the

2524
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,800
electric scooters or whatnot without

2525
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,800
really understanding that um and that

2526
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,480
comes from transport labor literature

2527
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,639
that the main Innovation that Ubi brings

2528
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,860
to the table perhaps is not uh

2529
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:49,500
connecting drivers and users because

2530
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,659
that existed before and I mean informal

2531
01:46:51,659 --> 01:46:54,780
transport without the app of course but

2532
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:58,619
it exists in most uh cities in the world

2533
01:46:58,619 --> 01:47:00,600
in a global some Global Northern cities

2534
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,280
being an exception rather than the rule

2535
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:06,179
but the actual Innovation is degrading

2536
01:47:06,179 --> 01:47:09,239
transport degrading working relations to

2537
01:47:09,239 --> 01:47:12,179
uh end of the 19th century basically a

2538
01:47:12,179 --> 01:47:14,280
worker has very few rights so it does

2539
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:15,659
not have the right to unionize to

2540
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:17,699
collectively bargain and it's not even

2541
01:47:17,699 --> 01:47:19,860
recognized as a worker it's basically

2542
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:23,659
some kind of free atom contractor

2543
01:47:23,659 --> 01:47:25,639
who

2544
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:28,679
in spare Leisure Time engages in driving

2545
01:47:28,679 --> 01:47:31,320
people around the city which we all know

2546
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,560
from now a whole body of work on Uber is

2547
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,119
definitely not the case I mean these

2548
01:47:36,119 --> 01:47:38,639
people are full-time workers not just

2549
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:41,040
hobbyists who try to make some spare

2550
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,920
money on the on the side

2551
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,619
um so yes

2552
01:47:46,619 --> 01:47:49,139
that's what transport labor is about

2553
01:47:49,139 --> 01:47:50,880
some technical questions let's address

2554
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,980
those for the next discussion seminar is

2555
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:54,480
it the same way of working with

2556
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:58,320
PowerPoint and voice over

2557
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,420
um well the way I understand you did it

2558
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:02,280
in other discussion seminars is that you

2559
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:04,320
basically recorded your presentation

2560
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:07,320
which then either you sent to me I think

2561
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:09,119
that's probably a better

2562
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:12,060
solution and we basically listen to and

2563
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,000
then we have a discussion which you

2564
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,380
facilitate right as those who discuss

2565
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:17,480
the paper

2566
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:20,400
uh so it's not exactly voice over I mean

2567
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,320
so you don't present the PowerPoint live

2568
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,020
the idea is that you pre-recorded the

2569
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,719
presentation with your fellow uh

2570
01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:29,880
students

2571
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:32,219
and will the exam be online as well yes

2572
01:48:32,219 --> 01:48:34,739
the exam will be online and we are

2573
01:48:34,739 --> 01:48:36,960
meeting with basnick and David to

2574
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,639
discuss exactly how this will be done

2575
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,920
most likely we'll be in well obviously

2576
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:44,400
since we will not be in your rooms it

2577
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,139
will be an open book exam

2578
01:48:46,139 --> 01:48:47,820
so you will have access to the slides

2579
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:50,400
and all that so but since we haven't

2580
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,500
done that before it would be a classic

2581
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,420
exam we are we are discussing how to do

2582
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:56,880
this so that it's challenging enough for

2583
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:01,080
you and also not too difficult

2584
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:01,679
um

2585
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:04,139
right so with the voice voice over

2586
01:49:04,139 --> 01:49:05,400
indeed

2587
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:06,780
the Belgian Brussels government ever

2588
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:08,159
taken any action to prevent informal

2589
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:10,320
Transportation do you know how relaxed

2590
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,760
they are towards this well actually I

2591
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,060
researched these navit as they called

2592
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:17,460
they'll go from midi to the Charlevoix

2593
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,659
airport and

2594
01:49:18,659 --> 01:49:21,119
no the Russell's government is

2595
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:23,040
definitely not happy about these these

2596
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:26,239
uh informal taxis the situation there is

2597
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:30,659
that these men and all of them are a

2598
01:49:30,659 --> 01:49:31,800
male

2599
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:34,080
um uh official taxi drivers so they have

2600
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,600
a taxi license but what they basically

2601
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,600
do is that to make more money they offer

2602
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,239
individual seats in in the events and

2603
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:44,520
the taxis and that's precisely what's

2604
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,440
illegal so you cannot as a taxi driver

2605
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:49,040
in Brussels you cannot uh

2606
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:51,380
basically stand there on the street and

2607
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:54,360
try to approach potential passengers

2608
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:56,219
offering them individual places in the

2609
01:49:56,219 --> 01:49:58,440
car it has to be the whole car that is

2610
01:49:58,440 --> 01:49:59,340
rented

2611
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:03,119
well it's a bit ironic but uh what

2612
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,639
happened a few years after this practice

2613
01:50:05,639 --> 01:50:08,760
uh got into the focus of I don't want to

2614
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:10,080
say public debate but basically these

2615
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:11,580
drivers started being harassed by police

2616
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:13,080
and there was a legal procedure against

2617
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:16,619
them uh flipko I don't know if that name

2618
01:50:16,619 --> 01:50:18,840
rings a bell it's a company that runs

2619
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:21,300
the official pass from midi to Charlotte

2620
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:25,199
Airport started exactly exactly that so

2621
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:27,480
they basically now offer well now it's

2622
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,460
suspended but they started offering a

2623
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:31,860
van service which goes door to gate as

2624
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:33,540
it's called and it picks individual

2625
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,400
passengers and individual seats are

2626
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,500
offered and for some reason this is

2627
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:40,940
perfectly legal whereas the taxi drivers

2628
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:44,100
are apparently yeah engaging in an

2629
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:45,900
illegal activity

2630
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:49,920
no uh just uh just as a rebound do you

2631
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:52,739
know why flipko

2632
01:50:52,739 --> 01:50:54,900
um like implemented this but in a

2633
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:56,940
non-competitive way what I mean is that

2634
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:59,159
they're actually more expensive than the

2635
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:01,500
not that they're like informal of it

2636
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:04,440
because I think they they have a very

2637
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:07,260
different customer Target so people who

2638
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,780
would take an event that's also from my

2639
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:12,300
own work they would be very often of

2640
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:13,800
immigrant backgrounds so there's a lot

2641
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,300
of people from Eastern Europe from

2642
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:18,000
maghreb who are quite simply used to do

2643
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,440
this mode of Transport for them this is

2644
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,280
a very common thing to see

2645
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:26,159
and use in the country of origin

2646
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:29,520
and also they the drivers of the navette

2647
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,739
would basically find the customers on

2648
01:51:31,739 --> 01:51:33,480
the spot itself so you walk towards the

2649
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:34,920
bus I don't know if you've ever had that

2650
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,860
experience but uh whenever I had to walk

2651
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:39,080
to the bus

2652
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:42,659
or flipko and they would try to approach

2653
01:51:42,659 --> 01:51:45,000
you and convince you to ride with them

2654
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
whereas I think uh people who use the

2655
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,679
internet who have access to a website

2656
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:52,500
who can who know how to book a ride who

2657
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,800
have a credit card to book a ride

2658
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,239
that's uh yeah that's a different Target

2659
01:51:57,239 --> 01:51:59,540
group

2660
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:02,340
um so maybe that's why flipko can offer

2661
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:04,199
prices which are not exactly competitive

2662
01:52:04,199 --> 01:52:07,080
on the economic front

2663
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:09,000
um

2664
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,920
well but what it means that's the last

2665
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:13,260
sentence about the navette is that uh

2666
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:15,179
informality in this case it's some kind

2667
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:17,580
of a front for in this case State

2668
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:19,500
institutions to Define what's legal or

2669
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:22,860
not I mean for them to decide that the

2670
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:25,320
navage the informal drivers are informal

2671
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:28,500
and therefore legal and I mean it's an

2672
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,119
arbitrary decision to decide that this

2673
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:33,480
is informal whereas Uber is formal

2674
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,940
um or actually in the case of uber and

2675
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:37,980
Brussels authorities the regional

2676
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:39,780
authorities pretend that Uber does not

2677
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:41,100
exist

2678
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:43,199
so they don't chase it away but they

2679
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:45,780
also don't promote it which is a perfect

2680
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:48,420
playground for Uber they are they that's

2681
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:50,040
exactly what they want

2682
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:52,440
and they they are not interested in

2683
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:54,840
being recognized as an official public

2684
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,280
transport service for example because

2685
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:58,679
that would mean having to comply with a

2686
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:00,900
lot of regulations uh which they of

2687
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:04,159
course not interested in complying with

2688
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:07,260
in in your research about this do you

2689
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:10,260
know if like uber uh drivers partner up

2690
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:13,679
with the like informal Navid drivers to

2691
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:16,619
actually try to convince clients to use

2692
01:53:16,619 --> 01:53:18,659
the informal Navid rather than the

2693
01:53:18,659 --> 01:53:22,380
flipko for example no I don't no no I in

2694
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:23,699
this particular case they definitely not

2695
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:27,179
I mean the Navid drivers as most likely

2696
01:53:27,179 --> 01:53:29,280
taxi drivers in Brussels they hate Uber

2697
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,440
they really don't like that it exists

2698
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,119
because it basically eats into the

2699
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,980
market

2700
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:36,480
um I'm not saying the taxi driver is

2701
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,179
here you know some

2702
01:53:38,179 --> 01:53:42,300
angels and and uh most uh I don't know

2703
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:43,739
uh

2704
01:53:43,739 --> 01:53:46,739
uh fun well not fun people to work with

2705
01:53:46,739 --> 01:53:49,139
or on but uh I mean

2706
01:53:49,139 --> 01:53:52,380
they they can also uh offer services

2707
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:54,840
which are overpriced and and try to rip

2708
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:57,000
off tourists and and or I don't know

2709
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,699
people who come back home Intoxicated by

2710
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:01,320
you know taking a very long route or

2711
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,880
whatever with Uber of course the

2712
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,679
advantage is that you know the price

2713
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:07,139
before you get into the car more or less

2714
01:54:07,139 --> 01:54:09,119
but in this case no there's definitely

2715
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,400
no collaboration I would say that there

2716
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:13,320
is some conflict even

2717
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,940
uh

2718
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:17,159
uh you probably heard about that already

2719
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:19,020
happened at least three times massive

2720
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:21,380
strikes of taxi drivers against

2721
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:23,820
uh some kind of effort towards

2722
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,280
regularizing Uber by the Brussels

2723
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:30,619
Brussels Capital Region authorities

2724
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:36,540
any more questions comments

2725
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:40,080
well it also goes without saying that

2726
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:42,600
um at some point you will be picking uh

2727
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:46,080
topics for your master thesis and you

2728
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,940
are very welcome to pick some related to

2729
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:50,159
transport and Mobility either supervised

2730
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:51,719
by me or by other people there is some

2731
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:54,480
more in the in our team and in different

2732
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,699
departments as well but

2733
01:54:56,699 --> 01:54:59,520
um I don't know if I've succeeded

2734
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:03,420
probably to some extent but not fully

2735
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:06,060
but if this there was one thing that I

2736
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:07,500
really wanted you to understand about

2737
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,900
transported Mobility is that at least

2738
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:10,980
from the critical geographical

2739
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:13,260
perspective it's a really really diverse

2740
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:16,980
field there's plenty of things to to do

2741
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:18,480
um and there's plenty of interesting

2742
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:21,719
things to do so I yeah I really look

2743
01:55:21,719 --> 01:55:24,300
forward to seeing your research topics

2744
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:26,219
uh and hope that at least some of them

2745
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:28,580
will be related to transported Mobility

2746
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:31,260
and if you need some little push or some

2747
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:33,000
encouragement we are always there to

2748
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,619
help you with finding some interesting

2749
01:55:34,619 --> 01:55:37,500
literature for inspiration and whatnot

2750
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,940
so

2751
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:40,980
um I really really hope we meet in

2752
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,100
person one day uh I hope it's not uh too

2753
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,360
far in the future

2754
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,619
I really hope that we can do an

2755
01:55:46,619 --> 01:55:48,600
Excursion uh even though it's on

2756
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,179
transport it's interesting uh people say

2757
01:55:51,179 --> 01:55:53,400
so

2758
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:55,739
voila I I really hope that we can do

2759
01:55:55,739 --> 01:56:00,780
that in March April May the latest so

2760
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:03,540
