>> Welcome everybody and evening.

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,340
Welcome to the second session.

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:39,620
of urban social geography. Thanks for being here despite the live stream and the

5
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,900
recording. I think it really makes sense to be here so we can have a bit of an

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:54,580
interactive session. How did you arrive in Brussels first week? Everything going

7
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,580
Okay, yeah.

8
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,900
Yeah, okay.

9
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,500
Your landing still a little bit.

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,900
How did you find a stonselow for those attending?

11
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,780
Did someone attend?

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,420
Stonselows, yeah.

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,980
Then I'll live up to your expectations more or less.

14
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,380
And you find it weird and they started with over 50%

15
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,700
of the urban population lifts and cities.

16
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,580
That was on the first slide.

17
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,100
OK.

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,220
We didn't have a deal that she would put that on there.

19
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,340
But I can see her critical minds.

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,780
You can start thinking about first slides so that we have

21
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,780
her answers here.

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,020
Ready?

23
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,020
OK.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,100
Today we'll be talking about--

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:57,100
I could say an important chunk of research into urban geography.

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Most of my geographers, yes.

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:09,100
I haven't. No, last week that. Yeah, it didn't work.

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,100
Yeah, you remember? Yes.

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,100
Okay. That's what, no, this system doesn't work.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,100
I'm not sure why.

have a singing voice, so I'll try to project my ideas.

32
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,900
And if you don't hear it, I can give it a bit higher or louder.

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,540
But maybe we should be a little bit quiet

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,740
and then that will help as well.

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,900
So, rural cities, global cities,

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,300
one of the big debates I think in urban geography

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,860
and urban cities more widely.

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,820
It's also a very long standing debate going back

39
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,940
at least the eighties, which probably also explains what you had to read all

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:55,540
stuff that you may or may not find outdated. I hope it's not outdated. They're

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,980
all text but I think it's still relevant in one way or another and we'll also

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,380
try to discuss that a little bit. Now what's the structure of today? There's

43
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:13,660
three main parts of this lecture. First of all, we're going to discuss, I mean very generally,

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,900
the centrality of cities and city regions in the global economy and we'll take you through

45
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,220
three complementary views, I've used that built on one another by Joe Friedman, Sosca,

46
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,780
Sosca, and Alan Scott. Secondly, so that's kind of a conceptual theoretical discussion.

47
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:36,220
Secondly, we'll have more of a methodological discussion, which deals with how given these

48
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,840
concepts how we can actually measure and say something empirical about world cities and

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,580
global cities.

50
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:49,540
And one of the main methodologies there is the methodology by GOG, which is the globalization

51
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,700
and world cities research network, which was founded somewhere in the 1990s by Peter Taylor.

52
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,020
has been one of the main, you could say, empirical methodological contributions to the

53
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,620
debate from that period.

54
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:13,460
And third of all, as we'll learn, there was some kind of a dominance by Gorg, if you will,

55
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,260
in this area of cities in globalization.

56
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:24,940
And there is a dominant voice, there is also quite a bit of friendly and unfriendly critique

57
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:33,660
criticism toward this particular framing of global safety and world safety formation.

58
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:41,660
And I think going into these debates is actually quite telling as to how we define global

59
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,380
cities where we think that that criticism is justified, whereas perhaps less justified,

60
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,300
very beautiful with other kind of issues. And I'll be talking about four of those

61
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,980
points of criticism. One you could call the post-colonial critique, a social

62
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,660
constructivist critique, people that talk about state riskailing on the role of

63
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,900
the state and then finally some brilliant minds that had something to say

64
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,220
about financialization, okay, and that may alter our reading of what actually

65
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:23,420
happens in global cities. But before we start, my question to you, why are cities central

66
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:29,140
in the global economy and what would it mean to say that cities are actually powerful,

67
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:36,820
economically powerful? Take a minute, talk to your neighbor right-time few notes and think

68
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:45,780

81
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Yeah, so how are cities central and global economy and why how can we see that you're powerful?

85
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,620
to focus on.

86
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,420
And so basically, like in the papers

87
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,420

And that's why it gets more and more forward sometimes

91
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,960
even more than the nation states are

92
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,380
motivated because they become a part of this international network

93
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,580
of those protocols they use.

mostly not to be rural these days,

97
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,700
but also like function capital is placed in those big cities.

103

This is built on the way, for example,

111
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,840
but flows, because this is the only thing

112
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,060
that we would do, that all these flows come together

113
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,740
in large cities, and then it becomes more than,

114
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,940
it goes from this large city to another large city,

115
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,020
a better, most better than the national level.

to the enterprise by venturing,

131
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,620
political centers and the national economy and the national politics. And it seems to be also that

132
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,340
there are some kind of an extraterritorial or supernatural authority there as well.

133

Okay, thanks a lot for your answers. I think there's other options to talk about, but I think you

134
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:02,820
already got to some of the essential points. I'm going to show you a bit of a data list of figures,

135
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,140
But just to give a little bit of exhibits as to how important economic terms

136
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,980
then and perhaps also think that political terms, some world cities or world city regions or

137
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:23,460
global city regions are. This is a list and this is research by a certain man named Alombrecht

138
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:30,180
from the early North East. Nick compared the main, you could say leading metropolitan areas in

139
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,260
in Western Europe. So it's by no means an international comparison at the global scale.

140
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:43,940
But it's comparing Delta Metropolis. This is basically Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague, etc.

141
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:50,660
The Flamish Diamond, which is roughly speaking Ghent Antwerp, Nervin Brussels,

142
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,220
which is kind of the economic heartland, if you still remember in Belgium,

143
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,420
Rairan-Rur area, which is Western Germany, kind of old industrial area, which is a large

144
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,820
conservation with a lot of industrial activity, or at least it used to be.

145
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,740
You, the France, this is basically Greater Paris and then Greater London is Greater London.

146
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,380
Okay? So comparing these five areas on a number of characteristics and you also see

147
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,740
the next figures, what he kind of finds is that these region city regions, much of

148
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,820
often areas are punching above their weight.

149
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,820
If you compare the share in a national surface,

150
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,860
so the size in terms of built up structure,

151
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,980
then the complete territory is actually quite small.

152
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,420
And you compare that to figures in population,

153
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,340
this largely outweigh the share in national territory.

154
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,860
And then when you look at the share of these areas in GDP,

155
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,660
which is kind of the value,

156
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,020
total value of all economic transactions,

157
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,380
which is a full measure in many ways,

158
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,380
but it's one way of starting to compare national economies.

159
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,660
We see that these areas actually

160
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,580
point about their rates.

161
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,980
So for instance, when you look at the Flemish diamond,

162
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,900
to take the Belgian example, 30% of national service,

163
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,580
52% of the population lives there,

164
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,620
but 63% of all economic activities actually

165
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,020
they place there.

166
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,220
More striking figures are even there for Paris.

167
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,780
London only 1% of the territory about, we

168
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,620
could say, 1/10 to 1/5 of the population,

169
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,900
but in terms of economic power,

170
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,820
especially in the case of Paris, it's way bigger than you

171
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,780
would in this.

172
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,380
So on large agglomeration and concentration,

173
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,540
of you could say economic transactions

174
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,180
that is taking place.

175
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,560
It also means that a lot of these places

176
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,780
tend to be richer than their hinterlands.

177
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,020
So it's kind of a runaway process at something

178
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,500
when these activities that are taking place there,

179
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,580
that generates more wealth per capita.

180
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,660
So this is GDP per head.

181
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,060
So it divides the value of economic activities

182
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,540
by the total population in that city.

183
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,700
So typically these places are richer than your pain

184
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,500
average and also compared to the rest of the encounter.

185
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,940
In that sense, when you look at Brussels,

186
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,220
Brussels is, you could say, the richest city in Belgium.

187
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,620
In principle, richer than the rest of Belgium.

188
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,340
But as we discussed last week, there's

189
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,220
a lot of this well actually in leaking to the periphery,

190
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,620
which is actually in flawless and mononia.

191
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,700
So it doesn't really show when you look at

192
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,820
at figures from the press of capital region,

193
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,380
but the same would actually apply.

194
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,460
Another way of looking at it is that,

195
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,260
and this was kind of referred to by

196
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,460
the concentration also of ideas innovation people.

197
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,940
It's very difficult to measure that.

198
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,500
One way of doing it is looking at patents, right?

199
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,780
Which is a kind of certification,

200
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,780
legal certification that something has been invented in one area or another,

201
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,780
a COVID vaccine, some kind of a chick, an algorithm, whatever.

202
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,780
And it has intellectual property on it.

203
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,780
So, and it can be commercialized in one way or not.

204
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,780
But it's a very, you could say, post hoc, exposed kind of measurement of places.

205
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,780
And there, there, there, a measure of innovation.

206
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,780
But it's a way to compare different areas.

207
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:43,120
What you see is that here it's a bit more mixed, a few, for instance, in France, you

208
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,500
see that Paris is actually outperforming the rest of the country.

209
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,860
This is far less the case in the UK, but it is the case in France's "The Flammish

210
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
Dark."

211
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,860
It's a bit more of a bit mixed picture, but we see that in general there's a tendency

212
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,400
to locate, you could say, innovative processes

213
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,700
as evidence to battles.

214
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,300
There's a lot of innovation that is not being measured here,

215
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,860
no social innovation, for instance.

216
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,280
It's really linked to technologies, high-end services

217
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,620
and these.

218
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,180
When you look at the structure of labor market,

219
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,940
you see that typically metropolitan areas

220
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:34,860
These also show a higher share of highly educated, highly educated work.

221
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:41,620
So substantially bigger, say in the delta metropolis,

222
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,500
it's 30% of highly educated people compared

223
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,820
to more or less 20% in the rest of the netlands.

224
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,220
And you can have a look at the other cities

225
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,620
to see how it fits.

226
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,660
So a different kind of labor market structure,

227
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,260
which tells us something about the kinds of activities

228
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,940
that are probably taking place there.

229
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:08,100
And another indicator there is when you look at

230
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,980
the employment figures across different kinds of sectors.

231
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,740
So there's the three sector model

232
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,420
that's agriculture industry and services.

233
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,340
And we see that obviously agriculture is very small,

234
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,180
but that's a constant everywhere,

235
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,420
but that there's a significant large share

236
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,980
and services in these metropolitan areas

237
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,180
than in the rest of the country.

238
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,740
So it's, these are places that are not marked

239
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,260
by industry, but by service economies.

240
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,020
So these are just a number of exhibits

241
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,980
that tell you something about the economic importance,

242
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,020
but it doesn't really tell you why these places are important.

243
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,500
It's just kind of a hint that something is going on.

244
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,580
And actually you already mentioned quite a few ideas

245
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,100
of how we can theorize the centrality

246
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,380
or at least conceptualize the centrality and power

247
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,180
in off cities in the global economy.

248
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:14,300
One of the main texts that is in the reader for this week

249
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,900
was this relatively hypothesis by John

250
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,660
to throw red it so you can just interrupt me

251
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,460
if you want to interject something.

252
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,740
But I just want to give you a number of notes

253
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,300
of my personal notes on what John Friedman was actually

254
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
writing about.

255
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,460
So a bit of context to this thesis or high hypothesis,

256
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,220
it's a hypothesis that groups a number of observations

257
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,940
from the 1980s tries to come up with a bit of a research

258
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,140
a gentle, that meets empirical testing.

259
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Right?

260
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,420
But you need to understand a bit more of this context

261
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,540
of the 1980s.

262
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,300
People of my age have to have the habit of starting history

263
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,100
in the 1980s, because it was the decade they were born.

264
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,940
If I was 10 years older, I was probably

265
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,540
going to refer the 1970s.

266
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,940
But as a toddler, this was my context, right?

267
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,140
So you have to remember that 1980s was this emerging kind

268
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:24,860
idea that we would experience the end of the city. It was the rise of information and

269
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,380
communication technology on a very democratic large scale, not yet the internet, but that was

270
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:37,740
emerging in the 1990s and being democratized, cheap mass transportation became very cheap to fly around

271
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:46,700
the world, shipping became something that was very affordable and what we kind of see is a complete

272
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:54,140
restructuring of the economy, this kind of reaching its high day in the 1980s. It was already going

273
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:01,500
on in the 60s and 70s, but by the 1980s what became obvious is that we are in a new situation,

274
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:09,660
which we'd call the new international division of labor with new kinds of geographies of production,

275
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:16,620
much more to the global east and far less centered on the old industrial areas in,

276
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:22,620
say, European and America, what we've been discussing last week. And we see that this new

277
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:30,540
centrality of cities need theorize. If cities are not the places where a lot of goods are produced

278
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,580
and hence where you get some kind of a trade surplus when you start trading these commodities,

279
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,780
say textiles, etc. with other places in the world. What is then the kind of source of power

280
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,620
that cities actually hold? And what John Friedman comes up with is a look to answer this question.

281
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,220
We have to look at how cities are actually being inserted. And indeed an urban system that is not

282
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:58,140
only national but a separate national is actually a global urban system. You have to understand it

283
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,860
And most in the 1970s, a lot of the tradition in urban geography was looking at urban systems

284
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,380
in a very nationalist way.

285
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,460
It was a methodological nationalism.

286
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,940
It was looking at Argentina.

287
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,060
You have Buenos Aires, which was the central city.

288
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,100
And then you had a number of smaller towns.

289
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,540
But there was a huge concentration there.

290
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,500
And it left to some blind spot, as to what actually the position of these cities were

291
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,140
and processes that went beyond national economies.

292
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,860
And as these processes became ever more prominent,

293
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,260
it requested a huge--

294
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,460
you could say conceptual innovation that started

295
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,220
to emerge in 1970s and it is hence

296
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,860
the importance of freedom theorizing, conceptualizing

297
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,700
about world city.

298
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,020
So a global urban system and the kind of main underlying

299
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,660
hypothesis-- sorry, yes.

300
00:21:52,660 --> 00:22:02,820
So the last part, what I was saying is that you have processes of globalization, which means

301
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,200
that the way that urban geographers were looking at urban systems, the king obsolete

302
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
in one way or another.

303
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:17,540
They were mostly linked to how economies were functioning at the national scale, looking

304
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,200
into, could say, where productivity is located, how could we

305
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,760
get flows organized, how capital flows, etc.

306
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:33,320
But as an increased share of the economy became, you could say, international or transnational.

307
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,920
Yes, the first thing that needed to happen was some kind of a conceptual framework or apparatus

308
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,520
that allowed to understand centrality at a different level.

309
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,560
But differently, instead of talking about national urban systems, people started talking

310
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:52,440
about global urban systems. But looking at centralities. So what

311
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,040
freedom kind of started to argue also on the basis of his reading of David

312
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,120
Harvey in 1970's Ammano Acastels is that we can only understand what goes on in

313
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,560
cities if we relate that to the position of these places in this global

314
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,320
urban system. So it's the kind of their function that they take in the global

315
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,520
economy or rather in this global urban system that will have to explain

316
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:23,120
what we find in certain places. Turn around on the other side of that corn is that this global

317
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,120
urban system or this global economy can also be embarked explained through what is going on in

318
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,280
P global cities or in this case world cities. We use the terminology. So, it's the processes that

319
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,720
emerge and are steered and controlled from these places that will have an impact on them.

320
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,040
larger macro processes in the global economy.

321
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,280
So that's kind of this dialectic global system,

322
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,240
macro level urban system world cities,

323
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,240
and they're kind of co-productive or co-constitative.

324
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,680
So one of the main excerpts are key observed excerpts there

325
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,240
from his world to the hypothesis, which is kind of very point

326
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,160
is key cities throughout the world are used

327
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,120
by global capital as basing points

328
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,760
in the spatial organization and articulation

329
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,960
of production and markets.

330
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,040
The resulting linkages make it possible to arrange a world

331
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,480
cities into a complex spatial hierarchy.

332
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,840
So it's about appreciating how indeed capital is--

333
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,280
and its actors--

334
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,320
is kind of basing itself in cities as they organize

335
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,400
global production and commercial activities.

336
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
So that was kind of the main focus.

337
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,840
And if we understand that, we will start explaining

338
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,600
why certain places are important and others less,

339
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,360
and why some cities are dependent on this process,

340
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,240
and why others are actually powerful.

341
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,120
So yeah, as I said, it's a period of view economic restructuring.

342
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,760
The laws of a lot of functions that were typically taking place

343
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,760
in cities, and I mean, John Friedman was writing

344
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:12,160
from Los Angeles, which was a very production-centered town

345
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,480
or city.

346
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,320
And it was losing functions.

347
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,760
What he observed was still a huge concentration

348
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,720
of skyscrapers, portraits, head porches.

349
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,000
But production had long left.

350
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,440
So this kind of conundrum was how do we explain that?

351
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
How do we make sense?

352
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,200
And indeed, as I've been explaining,

353
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,280
you had as the new international division of labor activities

354
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,200
that were being off-short to other parts of the globe.

355
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,840
And the emergence of a new set of enterprises, corporations,

356
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,080
multinational corporations, if you could say,

357
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,840
an American firm would be globalizing

358
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,440
or multinational corporations where it was actually kind of hard

359
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,240
to still identify to what extent

360
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,920
they were still connected with some territory.

361
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,120
Yes?

362
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Let me say that the production activity has low left.

363
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,120
What is the expectation of these production activities?

364
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I mean, it was the question when I was reading the text.

365
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,280
- Yeah, I mean, obviously it would depend on the city

366
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,480
that we're talking about, but think about what happens

367
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,400
in cities like Brussels, I mean textile industry,

368
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,960
all kinds of production facilities for consumer goods

369
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,200
that were initially

370
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
I mean, think about washing machines,

371
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
in editing that you use in the kitchen.

372
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,200
These were typically produced in the post-door era

373
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,200
in, you could say, the high income industrialized countries.

374
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
But because there was, you could say, pressure on the profitability

375
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,200
of these activities, because the wages were rather high.

376
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,200
These activities were offshore by a national,

377
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,840
emotional and not in national corporations.

378
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,280
And one of the main motivations was the search

379
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,160
for lower wages.

380
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,320
Or you could say, let's regulate labor markets

381
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,640
than what was occurring in the traditional industrial areas.

382
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Yes?

383
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
[INAUDIBLE]

384
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
[INAUDIBLE]

385
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,520
You make other countries, others.

386
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,440
and this bill is in just one thing,

387
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,440
all the other firms are the big things.

388
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,520
So, so they need to be for a different experience

389
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,120
and moving everything in the world

390
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,360
to have kind of summer.

391
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,640
- Yes, yeah, indeed.

392
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,840
I mean, and sometimes a little bit of confusion there

393
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,120
because people sometimes say, okay,

394
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,440
the industrial activities shifted to the periphery.

395
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,920
So I think in the first instance,

396
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
it's the initial periphery of the city.

397
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,960
I mean, the volume is suburbs.

398
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,200
But I think even, and it had something to do with,

399
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,680
you can say more,

400
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,400
the urban geographies, the land trends,

401
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,440
the ground prices in cities,

402
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,200
because it's, I mean, in large surfaces.

403
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,400
And it's easier to organize the rifries,

404
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,640
but at the later stage, they would basically,

405
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,800
I mean, these activities were either cut

406
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,760
because of investment and technology

407
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,360
and because you needed less jobs.

408
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:30,360
to make the same products and for there were shifted to other places around the globe.

409
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,360
So this is kind of what started to occur.

410
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,360
I mean some people even in some industries it was already in the 1950s.

411
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,360
This didn't happen over a day.

412
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:49,360
But it culminated if you were in the 70s and then the early 80s, which was a period of crisis in a lot of cities.

413
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,280
So, yeah, this new type of corporate,

414
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
actable to national corporations,

415
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,120
transnational corporations,

416
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,400
and how they organize global production networks.

417
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,640
So, a production network that used to be

418
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,520
kind of regionalized,

419
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,040
or nationalized in one way or another,

420
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,320
relied on local suppliers,

421
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,800
ended up being global.

422
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,520
I mean, if you have tried to order a bike in the past one year,

423
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,600
you know what it means to depend on

424
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,120
global supply chains or production networks, it's just an intensely fine-tuned process.

425
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,600
If anything goes wrong, I don't know, a tanker blocking the Suez Canal or something.

426
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,760
It's a precarious situation, but that's the kind of reality global supply chains.

427
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,000
And it's a part of the economy that's extremely dominated by these multinational corporations.

428
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,600
just some figures. I mean, there's a timeline there in 1960, there's about 66 billion.

429
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:54,160
What was kind of foreign direct investment, sort of for the technical terms here, but it means

430
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:01,040
direct investment in setting up factories. So you build a plant somewhere else,

431
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,760
so like Mercedes-Benz builds a plant in Korea or something, I'm not sure if they did.

432
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,280
are two-yota builds of plans in Texas.

433
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,800
In this kind of foreign direct investment logic,

434
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,680
M, it boom basically.

435
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,360
And you look at the figure of the 2016,

436
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,800
I could update that, I should probably do that.

437
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
About the third of the global economy

438
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,960
is actually equivalent to these,

439
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,360
and the I think, yes.

440
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,040
Foreign direct investment.

441
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,920
It's not too important,

442
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,280
but you just have to understand

443
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,920
that this is a measure of transnational flows.

444
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,920
So it's a measure of what part of the economy

445
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,920
is not local but is actually global or transnational.

446
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,680
And it relates to the investment activities

447
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:00,720
while large corporations to set up greenfield investments

448
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,840
as a skull.

449
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,680
So imagine a greenfield where you put into factory

450
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:13,920
those such as Brownfield redevelopment, which is an ex-site, which is then a refurbished

451
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
or one way or another.

452
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay, so these are those kind of activities.

453
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,920
So 90% of this global economy of this FDI is concentrated in these multinational corporations

454
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,040
and slowly getting to my point here.

455
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,560
This is also why John Freeman was looking at multinational corporations and their geographies

456
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,000
to identify and conceptualize world cities.

457
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,780
So for jump treatment,

458
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,400
treatment at the cities where a lot of these headquarters

459
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,180
by these international corporations were located,

460
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,640
were, I mean, those were those cities

461
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,520
that they identified as world cities.

462
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,320
So since they saw important in the global ecosystem.

463
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,320
Okay.

464
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,360
So as he says, world cities are then to be sites

465
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,720
for command and control.

466
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,920
And he really saw these corporate headquarters

467
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,280
as the place is that controls and command it

468
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,640
in various ways, either to governance systems

469
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,400
by decision making, by the internal structure,

470
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,120
how global production was being organized.

471
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,920
And his kind of methodological hypothesis

472
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:29,400
was if we map these headquarter geographies,

473
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,560
we will actually be able to map the global urban system.

474
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:40,040
And we'll also understand the relation between different kind of cities as to who controls

475
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,280
what.

476
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,520
So it's a way to look at the power in this global urban network.

477
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,560
Some places are more dominant, hold more command and control functions than others.

478
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Okay.

479
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:57,640
So I then came up with this map or cartogram or whatever you want to call it.

480
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,720
And yeah, it's certainly dated because Soviet Union is still on there and it's not

481
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,720
not part of this figure, which is also debatable.

482
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,400
Maybe there were not, I mean, say,

483
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,680
your American corporate headquarters there,

484
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,520
but for sure there were links,

485
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,520
even with the Soviet Union and capitalist countries, for sure.

486
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,440
But the whole point is that what Friedman actually does here

487
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,440
is translate the critical tradition of world systems theory,

488
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,560
which is a way to explain uneven development

489
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,800
in the global economy to an urban framework.

490
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,160
So it identifies three kind of areas, globalization,

491
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,400
arenas, if you will, one centered on Asia,

492
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,480
one on North America, one on Western Europe.

493
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,200
And typically, it finds a power balance

494
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,040
where you have powerful cities with a lot of corporate headquarters

495
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,040
in, you could say, the northern part of the hemisphere

496
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,760
and more, you could say, subordinate roles

497
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,920
for countries in the global south.

498
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,960
So when you, for instance, look at Northern America,

499
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,680
you have Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York,

500
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,160
which are identified as core cities with a lot of headquarters.

501
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,800
And they're kind of organizational networks

502
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,000
stretch to the global periphery.

503
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,440
So there's connections with the Rio de Janeiro, for instance,

504
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,080
Buenos Aires.

505
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,880
And these are kind of semi peripheral cities

506
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,000
who also hold command and control functions

507
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,880
and headquarters, they're oriented towards these centers

508
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,440
in the global north, could be that there are subsidiaries

509
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,760
of large corporations that are organized in such a concept.

510
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,040
So it's a way to explain how power is distributed

511
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,560
in this global urban system, and also starts

512
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,280
to explain why perhaps some places benefit more

513
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,720
from this integration in the global urban system than others.

514
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,040
So it would probably lead to an accumulation of wealth

515
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,480
in cities in the global north, to some extent,

516
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,520
also in the Senate periphery, think about Rio de Janeiro.

517
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,840
But at the same time, it would also work

518
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,160
as some kind of a funnel of siphon

519
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,960
off a siphon actually of surface toward the global north.

520
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,200
For instance, a US corporation producing stuff

521
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,920
energy, data, in part there will be benefits locally but at the same time there will also

522
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,360
be an extraction of surface value to the global market.

523
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:38,200
So it's also a way to understand, believe in this global economy.

524
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,320
I know it's a lot, sometimes a lot of economic terms but just to give you an idea, a

525
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,920
restructured global economy and the imaginary of a global urban system and city-staking

526
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,160
and different role in that on the basis of their command and control functions which

527
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,840
frequently defines as headquarters functions. So that's world cities. World cities,

528
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,200
corporate headquarters, command and control. I'm just giving you a number of key concepts there.

529
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,520
A second way of theorizing it is, and that's why I also have the other texts,

530
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,600
I could have given you the entire book, the Global City, but it would have taken you a week,

531
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,960
probably, or at least a few days to actually read it. It's still in flight to Dusso, but it's a kind of

532
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:34,720
shorter kind of version of the argument, which kind of explains what centrality is to

533
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,880
Saskia Susson. Okay, but I'll give you a bit more context by referring also to her book,

534
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,640
the global city. So one of, you could say, what has been

535
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,400
argued to be one of the seminal pieces talking about cities in

536
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,880
globalization, it starts kind of from the same rooms as

537
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,560
Richmond. I mean, it had been a very intense conversation in

538
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,640
the 1980s about what is going on with cities, they have

539
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,280
shifting functions, they're faced with the industrialization,

540
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,240
etc. There's also fiscal crisis of the local state. A lot of

541
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,000
cities were in trouble if you saw the movie.

542
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,800
Pixie Driver with the young Robert Teneiro,

543
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,040
he's driving around the relaxed New York in a city

544
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,320
neighborhoods are in trouble.

545
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,800
There's a lot of blight.

546
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,960
So cities were struggling to think about what

547
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,640
our functions could be and what is going on, especially

548
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,200
in 1970s, is a complete restructuring of these urban

549
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,240
economies.

550
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,840
So for Susson, it's less only about, you could say,

551
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,720
new command and control function about headquarters.

552
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,920
She looks at the complete restructuring of urban economies

553
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,960
from, you could say, manufacturing jobs

554
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,480
to service economies.

555
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,360
So we already saw that the majority of economic activities

556
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,920
in metropolitan areas are services.

557
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,240
But she particularly focuses on a particular subset

558
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,640
of these services, which equals advanced producer services.

559
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,720
So in the coming months, you will probably

560
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,360
start to hate the notion of advanced producer

561
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,320
services or being treated by it.

562
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,440
But it's a kind of--

563
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,120
I mean, you probably never heard about it.

564
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,800
A night of the day I, before I ever read about it.

565
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,080
But it tells it's kind of trying to capture those very

566
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,240
sophisticated, if you will, professional services

567
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,520
and service inputs for other firms.

568
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,560
So in themselves, they don't really produce much.

569
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,720
But still, their input is very important

570
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,480
for other corporations.

571
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,900
Think about financial services,

572
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,600
law, management, consultancy, accounting,

573
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,720
and auditing, advertising, et cetera, et cetera.

574
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,800
So these are not really producing things

575
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,960
that you can buy and consume at some point.

576
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,720
This is actually very knowledge intensive,

577
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,320
sometimes it's also called knowledge intensive business services,

578
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,160
which are kind of consumed as the art produced.

579
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,160
So legal advice is kind of produced in face-to-face meetings.

580
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:19,480
Think about a corporation that wants to set up a shop

581
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,040
or a plant or an investment in China, a European firm.

582
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Probably you want to check, I think we are too, with a large international law firm that can give you a lot of experience as to what the regulations are for investment and other China.

583
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,880
you would need dedicated financial services.

584
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,200
How do you finance your international expansion?

585
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,280
You would need the advice of auditing firms accounting firms

586
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,240
because probably you want to attract some further funding

587
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,120
by issuing, I don't know, stocks above,

588
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,600
or something like that.

589
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,720
So financial investors would want to look at your activities.

590
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,560
Advertising, yes, how are you going to sell your cookies, cars, et cetera in China?

591
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,720
You need to know something about the local market or local markets, the sensitivities.

592
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,240
So yeah, you may want to adapt your practices there.

593
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:32,000
You may need to advise of management consultants because you may say that you want to globalize, but how are you going to

594
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,560
manages process, what kind of responsibilities do you give

595
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,320
to your managers in China?

596
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,520
Then they have the autonomy to take decisions.

597
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,760
Will you work with the central command structure?

598
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,360
How will you think about the profitability

599
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,840
of your activities, et cetera?

600
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,360
I mean, it's not a course in business studies here,

601
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,680
but just imagine as a firm that you want to globalize,

602
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,320
there's a lot of things that enter into the picture.

603
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,480
And probably these kinds of inputs that you need

604
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,040
are so specialized,

605
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,240
does it make sense to start producing them yourself?

606
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,320
So you just buy very specialized inputs.

607
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,400
You get in touch with lawyers, consultants, et cetera.

608
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,200
They would fly in and charge the hell out of you

609
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,200
and then run off and maybe a direct advice was, okay.

610
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,160
So it shifts to the service economy.

611
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,480
but with the globalization of production and globalization of markets and financial markets,

612
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,400
we see that certain service firms are becoming increasingly important.

613
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,960
And these are these advanced producer services, services given to producing firms.

614
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,040
And what she says is, look, instead of looking at headquarters of corporations,

615
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,080
we best look not at the multinationals themselves, but we best look at where these APS

616
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,280
firms are located.

617
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,120
And it's not just that they have kind of cold control

618
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,820
over global productions, networks, as you could

619
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,600
imagine, corporate headquarters where

620
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,920
CEO with a big cigar takes a decision of slashing

621
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,320
10,000 jobs in Belgium or something.

622
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:25,840
It's more dilute, diluted form of control,

623
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,080
which he talks about, is more about control capabilities.

624
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,760
is the assemblage, or we could say,

625
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,680
in the entire mixture of these kind of service economies

626
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,720
that allows firms that use these services

627
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,240
to exert control of the global scale.

628
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,440
So multinational corporations that

629
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,720
have a long story to start short depends

630
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,840
on yet another set of players, advancement use the services

631
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,040
to actually be able to manage global production.

632
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,800
So that's kind of her reading, not just corporate headquarters, but look at these notes

633
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,720
of advanced producers.

634
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,160
And the second important element that she links to that and will talk more about that

635
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,160
next week, and because it's a slightly different topic, is that this APS economy, this high

636
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:24,800
and service economies, also is an important engine in producing polarization, the other kind

637
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,440
of process that could use polarized cities, but an important driver according to Susson

638
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:41,120
is the highly remunerated salary stop in these kind of activities and this will have an

639
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:48,720
effect on this city. So it produces an outcome where you have high and low skilled labor forces

640
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,480
in APS or around APS.

641
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,400
And at some point, it could also even

642
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,680
lead to what she calls the peripheralization of the core.

643
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,040
So there will be a drive also to boost informal labor

644
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,920
markets in parts of the local economy.

645
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,360
But we'll talk more about that next thing.

646
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,120
So that's her idea about global cities.

647
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,480
And in the end, global cities

648
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,280
a site for the production of specialized services needed by complex organizations for running

649
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,180
a spatially diverse dispersed network of factors offices and services out there.

650
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,060
The production of financial innovations and the making of markets both central to the

651
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,080
internationalization expansion of the financial industry.

652
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,520
So for Sussan it's both about and you're free to refer to Sussan because it rhymes

653
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,240
with lessons as other students have done so before and make movies about.

654
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,760
So it's both about global production networks but also the running of global financial

655
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,920
markets.

656
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,560
So it's not just the production of goods themselves but also connecting to the world of

657
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,400
finance to get investment in these production.

658
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,160
So that's what SARS-CoS-CoS-CoS is talking about.

659
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:10,480
And the paradox that she sees is that as there's a kind of a dispersion of activities

660
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,800
at the same time there's a growing need for concentration.

661
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,880
The more dispersed global production networks,

662
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,640
the common financial markets,

663
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,520
the more the need for centralized control

664
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,840
or control capabilities over these markets.

665
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,280
So that's kind of the paradox of cities,

666
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,560
despite the internet, et cetera,

667
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,200
or virtualization of activities,

668
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,920
there's a continued role for face-to-face interaction

669
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,600
and interpretation in limited set of cities.

670
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,440
So why are APS located in a limited number of cities?

671
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,920
Well, she talks about different kinds of thought dependence.

672
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,440
So it means that one situation establishes itself

673
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,600
is kind of the whole kinds of self-reinforcing mechanisms.

674
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,540
So if there's a concentration, there's a deep market

675
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,440
and services.

676
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,360
So if you go to London, for instance, you're

677
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,800
quite sure that you will find everything.

678
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,240
If you have these kind of services,

679
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,640
some kind of a labor market culture

680
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,680
where we'll emerge around that.

681
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,520
You'll find a specialized labor there.

682
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,520
And yeah, in a lot of world and global cities think about New York

683
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,720
or London, some kind of a Yup culture,

684
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,720
young urban professional culture,

685
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,680
has emerged within these kinds of APS firms.

686
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,720
There's also a lot of synergies between these firms

687
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
and I'll tell you a little bit more about that.

688
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,880
So also these different KBS firms work together

689
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,240
as they service their clients.

690
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,680
And what is even more striking is that these APS firms

691
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,840
in and of themselves also become global corporations.

692
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,640
So they also set up international networks

693
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,960
either to follow their clients

694
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,960
or to remain credible as a global, as a vehicle act.

695
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:12,680
So a number of reasons why this kind of geography reproduces itself and is increasingly anchored

696
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,440
in a number and a limited number of global cities.

697
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:24,880
So my barracks, for my dear colleague from the Metu-Yehan Kickingen, who did a kind of

698
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,760
nice set of maps on law firms and Brussels.

699
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,720
It's kind of interesting to see that the concentration in global cities, you could say,

700
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,720
when at the more abstract level also translate into clusters

701
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,520
at the metropolitan level.

702
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,320
And that tells us something about, you can say,

703
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,440
the more micro-sociologies and geographies

704
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,160
of these kind of professional serves.

705
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,840
So what you see is on the left-hand side, the law firms.

706
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,200
The big picture of foreign law firms, the smaller insect

707
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,400
map is Belt and Ferns, the number of commonalities

708
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,120
avenue in these which is kind of center of a very rich neighborhoods or set of neighborhoods

709
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,860
and some Brussels as a location of boats. I think Belgian,

710
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:18,560
a group of people. I love from the local garden offer. What is foreign law firms or what

711
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:25,200
is special? For the foreign law firms they're very much concentrated around the EU district.

712
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,440
Okay, so a lot of activities

713
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,640
I'd have something to do with the client or clients

714
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,920
that are located there, which is either directly

715
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,920
European Commission or firms that want to not be

716
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,400
European Commission.

717
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,240
And this is kind of a process that we'll talk a bit more

718
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,240
when we do the tour and Brussels in the end of next week.

719
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,500
So micro geographies are also produced micro clusters

720
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,320
produced at the urban level.

721
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,680
The same is Vincent Stu in London.

722
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,040
Some great work by Cook at all.

723
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,440
Not Captain Cook, but another cook.

724
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,000
So we cook top this figure.

725
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,920
Obviously what you see there is a city of London,

726
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,440
which is also a very particular jurisdiction

727
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,560
in and of itself.

728
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,640
It has some kind of an exceptional room

729
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,600
that doesn't follow the regulations of, you could say,

730
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,120
the continent in this case of the UK and enough itself.

731
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,800
It's governed in a very weird way.

732
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,200
I never recall how exactly.

733
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,160
I don't know if you can make sure that the bridge is themselves.

734
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,720
But it's kind of a self-port,

735
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,040
I mean, the self-regulate itself,

736
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,200
governed jurisdiction on the island,

737
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,040
where corporations also have a large say in.

738
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,240
So within the limits of the long run, you find particular regulations there.

739
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,640
That's why the stock exchanges located there.

740
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,280
And all the financial institutions are located around.

741
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,920
And then besides that, the specialized district, the legal district, etc.

742
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,480
So the tendency of seeking proximity is also evident there.

743
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,440
A bit more on this, because of ABS complex, as I said, these firms also

744
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:23,760
interacted one another. So this is some work we did in Brussels. We took a corporate survey

745
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:31,600
aimed at APS professionals so we sent the survey around with with legal experts, expert,

746
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:37,920
ICT experts, etcetera, bankers and they kind of listed how they interacted with other APS firms

747
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,480
either in their daily practice for themselves or as they were giving service to their customs.

748
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:51,280
Okay, and what you find is actually quite a bit of interaction with sector itself.

749
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,160
And also particularly between sectors in law and finance, law,

750
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,920
accounts, and law, and accounts in financial services.

751
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:09,200
So just imagine as a corporation, what often happens is that when you issue some kind of financial

752
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,200
of product, think about a share or something

753
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,960
or you want to go for a loan.

754
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,880
Namely the financial institution, we need a law firm.

755
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,400
That needs to kind of come up with the prospectus

756
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,320
or check the prospectus that is made by financial institutions,

757
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,080
auditors and accountants that have a look at it.

758
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:36,080
So this is a kind of connected thing to financial markets.

759
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,280
What we also found is quite some interaction

760
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,920
between ICT and financial services.

761
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,080
This has something to do with,

762
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,080
you can say the virtualization of finance

763
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,000
that is currently going on.

764
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,600
So quite a bit of interdependencies

765
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,360
between different sectors will also explain

766
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,720
why does a need for proximity?

767
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,880
Yes, that's a question.

768
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,800
That's a very good question.

769
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,360
What do I remember from these percentages?

770
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,600
I think, all right.

771
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,200
So I think that it's standardized to the,

772
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,680
you could say the largest link.

773
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,440
So we looked at, you could say the intensity of interactions.

774
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,200
And we found that within financial services,

775
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,760
this has the strongest link.

776
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,760
So it's a relative scale.

777
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,760
So that's the strongest link.

778
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,000
It's 100%.

779
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,840
And then when you for instance look at the duration

780
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,480
between law and financial services,

781
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,680
the strength of the time between law and finance is only half of the kind of relations

782
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,720
within the finance itself.

783
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:45,920
It was measured in a different way.

784
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,680
It's measured by frequency.

785
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:58,000
So on a regular basis, how much do you hire advice in, you could say, "No, it's

786
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,280
or et cetera.

787
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,920
But there's other ways of measuring that for sure.

788
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,200
So it's one way of doing that.

789
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,560
So yes, this kind of gravitational pull towards other actors

790
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,720
in this APS complex explains kind of the reproduction

791
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,160
of global cities.

792
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,400
And another one was indeed this globalization

793
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,960
of strategies of APS firms themselves.

794
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,000
So they're both clustered and they're

795
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,520
globalized at the same time, deloed--

796
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,120
well, I mean, it's part of its branding process.

797
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,400
HSBC is the same thing.

798
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,200
So it's playing on both being global and tapping

799
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,320
into local knowledge.

800
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,560
You may think about that what we want,

801
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,760
but it's certainly part of their corporate strategy,

802
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,240
the geographical strategy, et cetera.

803
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,240
Yes?

804
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:52,760
OK.

805
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,760
- I think that's the public early days,

806
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,640
but I think that's what we have all about,

807
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,160
how open and forward to performance

808
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,160
that's been happening.

809
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,160
- No, I was taking care of my children.

810
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,680
But I think that's a good point.

811
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,680
I mean, I think for sure, there has been a tremendous impact

812
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,640
on business travel.

813
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,080
But it's also kind of a long discussion

814
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,320
as to what extent you need business travel

815
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,680
these are the video conferencing and all the kinds of things.

816
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,800
So there's already quite a bit of research in there.

817
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,280
There's also, you can say, more ethnographic approaches

818
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,080
that are kind of questioning the actual day-to-day

819
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,840
relevance of having a global network.

820
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,640
But definitely, artists offices really being used,

821
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,120
or I think they need there to have an address

822
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,640
and populate websites.

823
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,000
And then you may actually find that it's much more

824
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,360
concentrated within a number of global cities

825
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,040
despite having a very global network.

826
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,160
And it could be other ways of organizing yourself.

827
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,000
I haven't done very clusters or meetings or conferences

828
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,160
to make things work.

829
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,440
That there's also, and we'll read a bit about that,

830
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,760
practice of the governments of people that are based

831
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,400
in London, that are then two years based in Singapore.

832
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,680
So there are a lot of kind of strategies.

833
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:24,880
But yeah, the main kind of question in the DB is COVID.

834
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,520
Now the final proof that there's an end to the city,

835
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,560
I think that's hugely overblown.

836
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,760
And I think there's quite a bit of reasons

837
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,080
about the knowledge and density of certain practices

838
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,720
that explains why face-to-face interaction will prevail.

839
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,600
Just as when you think about teaching,

840
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,080
There's hopefully some added value to face the face teaching

841
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,400
overlooking at a screen.

842
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,800
And it has something to do with the interpretation

843
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,600
of information and is being shared about how

844
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,560
grounding processes work.

845
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,200
We think the same about certain concepts, et cetera.

846
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,000
And if you don't do this face-to-face,

847
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,920
you just miss out on this micro feedback loop.

848
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,240
If this would be online, I wouldn't see

849
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,880
nodding or frowning, so I would be in trouble sometimes.

850
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,120
But I think it's clearly, it's a very important question.

851
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,960
There will probably be a more strategic use of these sites,

852
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,520
and there will also be a more selective use

853
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,520
of face inflection, which would, I'm ultimately also

854
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,480
input, input, APS activities, and your geographies.

855
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:44,080
But it won't do a dissolution, I think, personally.

856
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,660
I see no theoretical reasons why that should be obsolete.

857
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:52,880
But it's research that could be done.

858
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,400
I mean, there's a whole class of people, digital nomads.

859
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,400
These are more, you could say, self-employed.

860
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,320
They don't depend on other inputs.

861
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,960
And their production process think about setting up

862
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
a website or something.

863
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,760
You can just go to Bali and do that from there.

864
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,840
But even there you see the emergence of temporary clusters,

865
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,680
other digital nomads that are in Bali,

866
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,360
discuss stuff, et cetera, et cetera.

867
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:27,080
So I think even there is a social aspect to that.

868
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,720
And you get the return of centrality,

869
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,960
even where you don't expect it.

870
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,400
And it seems to be something that is related to the fact

871
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,840
that we're talking about cognitive cultural capitalism.

872
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:45,560
And that's an excellent bridge to what Alan Scott is talking about

873
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,240
in his version of Global Siki regions.

874
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,280
So we talked about world cities, or the headquarters

875
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,040
Susson talks about global cities.

876
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,920
You look into a wider complex of these advanced services

877
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,720
that sit around corporations.

878
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:05,000
And then Alan Scott says, well, you and your world

879
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,840
and global cities have to explain something like this,

880
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:14,720
which is a much larger coloration, which is urban to some extent,

881
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,040
which depends here on San Francisco,

882
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,280
and it's easy to notice.

883
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,520
But how do you make sense of this wider San Francisco Bay area

884
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,720
with a lot of, you could say, centrality,

885
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,000
but it's not necessarily connected

886
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,320
to core metropolitan areas.

887
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,800
So what kind of--

888
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,960
and Scott is talking about it says, yes,

889
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,280
very nice that we talk about this classic.

890
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,160
world and global cities when you look for South Africa, South Asia, South Asia,

891
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:49,280
North New York, London, Tokyo, later on Chicago, and meet metropolitan areas.

892
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,640
But there's other kind of structures, morphological structures,

893
00:58:53,640 --> 00:59:03,080
polycentric regions that do not necessarily fit the definition that South

894
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,560
assassin or John Friedman is talking about. And it also links a little bit to what we discussed

895
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:15,880
last week. How the city looks like or where the urban is can actually spill over metropolitan

896
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:24,840
areas. Okay. So clearly places like Silicon Valley. They're not dependent on the poor urban area

897
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:32,920
per se, but they're also kind of an example of the need for proximity in high-end advanced

898
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:43,960
sectors. So what our consensus is that, yes, something is right, but the kind of wider

899
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:49,960
process that is going on is a process towards centrality in knowledge-intensive

900
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:56,600
activities. And this pertains to APS firms that are located and you can see the core

901
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:03,880
metropolitan areas, but it also applies to high-tech firms, the GAFAS platform corporations,

902
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:12,100
etc, etc, all these kind of innovations that came out of sort of conf

903
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,100
of the confederate since, or when you look at the per-refrigerate delta, which is a kind of much more

904
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:21,800
of all-centric production area in the southeast of China. It's also a form of centrality,

905
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,540
where you have some metropolitan areas or metropolitan course, but it also goes

906
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:33,820
beyond there. So what interests our Scott is more, yeah, this driver of centrality, built

907
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:40,640
APS themselves. And he says, look, this centrality that SARS-CoS-SUSAN finds is actually part and

908
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:48,860
part of a wider shift towards cognitive cultural captions. Right? So CCC and it means that

909
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:55,740
a lot of economic activities, crucially depends on knowledge inputs.

910
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,700
And types of knowledge that are not generic,

911
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:03,860
not standardized, that are not easily appreciable

912
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,020
at a distance.

913
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:08,740
No, you need interpretation, dialogue with clients,

914
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:11,540
dialogue with other colleagues to make

915
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:16,060
sense of what is going on, because it's a very complex matter.

916
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,940
need to make sense of the situation collectively,

917
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,140
and hence there's a drive for proximity there.

918
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,140
Okay?

919
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:28,140
And this applies to an increased part of the economy,

920
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:32,620
which also means that it's a goes way beyond

921
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,220
how it produces services.

922
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:39,380
So, and the spatial form it takes is one of global city regions.

923
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,740
So you have more,

924
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,980
pulling more frequency,

925
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,860
polycentric kind of structure.

926
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,460
And his kind of metagography, if you will,

927
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,100
is a world of global city regions,

928
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,580
that has kind of interconnection, interconnected

929
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,860
and blazer role in these global production

930
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,620
networks in global markets.

931
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,620
Yes.

932
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,740
Hi, can you really understand my news

933
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:04,740
about how we can from China to India or APS?

934
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:05,300
Yeah.

935
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,020
Because as I understand that, the [INAUDIBLE]

936
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:16,020
And this need is kind of connection to this ABS that are all this service has connected to.

937
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:23,020
Well, the point by Scott is that, yes, an ABS law firm's fund, etc.

938
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:27,020
There's a clear need for proximity to the reasons that we've been discussing,

939
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:31,020
but there's also a place to other parts of the economy.

940
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:37,020
Think about high-tech, think about education, you know, whatever.

941
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,260
And these are also prone to these agglomeration dynamics.

942
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:46,100
And that is because increasingly the production process

943
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,340
is knowledge intensive.

944
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:51,340
Just compared to, it's a 50 years ago,

945
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,220
it would have been a very standardized process

946
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,300
just make 1,000 cars per week.

947
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,420
This is becoming increasingly customized.

948
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,220
It's much more about prototyping,

949
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:06,500
it's much more about failure in particular cars.

950
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,940
I mean, I don't know anything about cars,

951
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,060
but I'm stuck with cars.

952
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:16,380
So it's much, much more just in time delivery,

953
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,940
it's much more tailored rather than mass production.

954
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:24,100
That used to be the case in the 50s, 60s, 70s,

955
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,460
and this has shifted.

956
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,260
Roughly in the 1980s,

957
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,260
where it was more about flexible production systems,

958
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,100
where you could say the connection with suppliers,

959
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:37,620
but also customers who are in the game much more important.

960
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:41,220
So it's a kind of broad scale restructuring of the economy.

961
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,860
So also explains why proximity matters,

962
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,140
not only in each of those that you serve,

963
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,860
but more broadly to the economy.

964
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:53,500
- But I don't understand what drives this company

965
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,140
to gather instead of providing for example.

966
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,620
- Okay, well, I have a whole lecture on that

967
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,660
and I can look at the lessons, right?

968
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:05,180
But I mean, and part of the story is you could say

969
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,420
the contemporary benefits of economic agglomeration,

970
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:11,140
which has something to do with what economic geographer

971
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,940
calls the externalities.

972
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,060
By being there, you get certain benefits

973
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,140
that you wouldn't get if you're not there,

974
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,140
stepping into high-scale labor,

975
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,120
high-scale labor, for instance,

976
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,020
and venture capitalists, et cetera, et cetera.

977
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,540
But there's a lot of what the whole part of the penancies as well.

978
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:31,380
And we do look at the story of Silicon Valley.

979
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:35,460
used to be a lot of government investment there.

980
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,980
Think US military and the semiconductor business

981
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,060
making chips and those kind of things

982
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,580
was huge funded by the federal government

983
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:49,060
in NASA, DARPA and all kind of ministerial defense.

984
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,820
And a lot of these innovations

985
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,660
were then later on commercialized by private players

986
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,940
who then used these technologies to build their own platforms.

987
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,260
And this great work by my Anna Madzukata, for instance,

988
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,860
through with great economists, says,

989
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:12,860
well, if you look at your iPad, almost every critical element

990
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:15,380
there piece of technology can be related back

991
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:18,940
to some kind of federal investment, et cetera, et cetera.

992
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:23,340
So which brings them to an argument about,

993
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,180
is it really private innovation that we're talking about,

994
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:29,960
or does it have something to do with the sustained investment

995
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,940
by public authorities in these kinds of investments?

996
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,820
The same is true for big pharma, for instance.

997
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:39,060
It's even first easy to come up with the new vaccines,

998
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:43,460
and these are then commercialized by Pfizer, et cetera.

999
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,220
So it's a very complex story, and no clear answer

1000
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,860
is a field of its own.

1001
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:53,220
But what we need to understand is that this proximity

1002
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:57,700
and the centrality goes beyond cities themselves.

1003
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:02,260
OK, so it's much more prevailing process.

1004
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:05,580
But, Phil, I mean, the point being is that at some point

1005
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:09,740
APS firms, even in these global city regions,

1006
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,340
they would still have some kind of a role

1007
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:16,140
to play as connectors, think about Silicon Valley firms

1008
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,620
that come up with new technologies,

1009
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:23,180
or that one can make a profit of these new innovations.

1010
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:28,100
They would have to be kind of certified back then that their intellectual property would be

1011
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:34,580
tetanus probably very likely that would be San Francisco based law firms that would then

1012
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:35,580
specialize.

1013
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:36,580
Okay.

1014
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:37,420
Okay.

1015
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,240
All right.

1016
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,080
Yeah.

1017
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,080
[INAUDIBLE]

1018
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:51,420
Yeah.

1019
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,220
Well, I mean, you now, this kind of--

1020
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,020
these are the debates.

1021
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,380
I'm just rehearsing the date of the 1980s, 90s.

1022
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,340
Slow to get into the Northeast.

1023
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:06,220
We'll move through that throughout the lecture.

1024
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:11,340
But this mainly tries to capture what went on in the 1980s

1025
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:14,140
and what was the starting point, if you will,

1026
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,580
or the theorizing of world and global cities.

1027
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:18,580
[INAUDIBLE]

1028
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:33,060
Yeah.

1029
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:36,860
Well, there, so the question is,

1030
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:39,660
do I extend as the Rust Belt at Global City?

1031
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:43,140
I don't think, I mean, it will.

1032
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:47,260
Alice Scott would really see that as a global city region,

1033
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,500
because it's mostly, you could say,

1034
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,620
a remnants of an older process of industrialization,

1035
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,180
which was much more focused on mass production.

1036
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:59,260
So think about fact-reasoned Pittsburgh, Detroit,

1037
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,420
et cetera, et cetera.

1038
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:08,780
the Ford factory. And this was kind of in the history of the US. It was a kind of process

1039
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:14,820
of industrialization that was finalizing again. But it's returning since the 60s, 70s.

1040
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:20,700
And then you had a switch to the some belt states. A lot of production, especially in the

1041
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:26,140
car industry, was taken over by Japanese investments. And a lot of states were the labor

1042
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:38,520
writes were less protected. So I mean the difference would be to what it's

1043
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:43,540
I mean it's just one example but a question would be to what extent Duke in

1044
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:47,780
this day in age, knowledge and tactic, intensive production activities are

1045
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:51,660
over at the state place in the Rust Belt, think to some extent this is the case

1046
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:55,660
but it wouldn't be an leading example.

1047
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:56,660
I don't want to be exclusive.

1048
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:59,660
I think it could be visualized as such,

1049
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,660
but it would be more of an empirical question

1050
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,660
to what extent is actually taking place.

1051
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:08,660
Whether it's just a morphology of old industrial area,

1052
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,660
like the rural area,

1053
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,660
or whether there's some kind of integrated region,

1054
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,660
which you do see in Silicon Valley

1055
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,660
because it's kind of organized about technology.

1056
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:35,660
We could perhaps argue that it used to be a global city region of yesterday year, but perhaps the globalization was less advanced there and then or at least it would be with the different.

1057
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:38,420
Okay, just to say there's different conceptualization,

1058
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:43,140
that's why to capture function with also the morphology of these places.

1059
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,620
I think it's something to reflect on and comparing where you get.

1060
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:52,420
Yeah, I think in the interest of time,

1061
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:57,260
I will have to move on because I'm using a lot of words.

1062
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,780
I think it's important that things are clear.

1063
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:04,260
Second of all, and I might speed up a little bit,

1064
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:12,020
I want to give you a methodological example of how people actually dealt with this conceptual apparatus

1065
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:20,260
of world and global cities and global city regions to measure these processes or empirically study these processes.

1066
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:25,060
So this is the work by the globalization and world cities research network.

1067
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:31,060
And it basically starts with whatever of questions I mean.

1068
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,740
When you look at some of these claims,

1069
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:38,460
I mean, it's one thing to say, yeah,

1070
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,340
we have the acknowledge growth city formation process

1071
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:44,020
of global city formation process,

1072
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,620
or to say that interurban connections are already important.

1073
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,660
And actually, when you start diving into this,

1074
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,300
you quickly run into trouble.

1075
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:57,220
And this is actually something that was kind of noted

1076
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:01,460
already in the '90s, so a very long time ago,

1077
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:06,260
but I want to give you the entire development of the agenda.

1078
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:11,980
That is actually quite a few insight into world city network

1079
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:12,460
information.

1080
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,740
So we had a number of case studies in the '80s and '90s,

1081
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:19,340
especially with Soskea Sosen, all particular set of cities,

1082
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,260
long the New York et cetera, et cetera.

1083
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,260
There was all kinds of hypotheses and claims

1084
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,900
about the insertion in a global urban system.

1085
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:30,580
But actually, invariably, there was very little insight

1086
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:31,300
into this.

1087
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:35,140
So what connects cities, how central was cities

1088
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,660
in these urban systems?

1089
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:42,860
It was kind of very much an ad hoc answer that you get

1090
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:46,020
to the extent that generally short sets,

1091
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,540
there's even a dirty little secret

1092
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,700
in world cities research.

1093
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,180
Actually, empirically, there's very little

1094
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,740
on the actual connections being made between cities.

1095
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:58,740
So we don't really know a lot about this.

1096
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:02,100
And this is something that kind of a research gap

1097
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,340
to use new liberals,

1098
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:05,460
academic speak,

1099
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:10,300
that globalization and world cities

1100
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,340
with search networks should answer.

1101
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:18,140
And there was a number of ways of trying to do with that.

1102
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:24,100
People tried to work with secondary data in 1990s

1103
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,500
of starting 1990s, thinking about for instance, yeah,

1104
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,260
looking at the flows of airline passengers.

1105
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:40,260
So how are cities connected by airlines?

1106
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,000
And this is gave rise to these kind of hyperb

1107
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,100
type of research that shares you.

1108
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:53,020
It's a raw city network of the basis of airline flows.

1109
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:57,500
Any idea whether this is a viable method.

1110
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:01,420
And we measure the centrality of cities in the global economy

1111
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,980
by using air life flows.

1112
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:06,860
Well.

1113
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:11,360
[INAUDIBLE]

1114
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,340
All right.

1115
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:21,340
[INAUDIBLE]

1116
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:26,660
Yeah, so major airports are not necessarily in closed cities.

1117
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,660
Yeah? Other ideas? Yeah?

1118
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:39,660
I'm going to find any of that as well.

1119
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,660
Oh, okay. Other kinds of sources to be used.

1120
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,660
Okay. So the flow of bitcoins.

1121
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,660
Okay. Yeah.

1122
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:49,660
I mean, more particularly with these kind of data on airline flows, other ideas?

1123
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:50,660
Yes.

1124
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:54,960
This is also a commercial model for a company

1125
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,620
where you hear, absolutely.

1126
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,460
- You're very, very bad at the department.

1127
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,620
- Absolutely, yeah, all right, yes.

1128
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,540
(muffled speaking)

1129
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:11,860
- That's exactly the same.

1130
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,260
I mean, it's debatable.

1131
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,540
I mean, are you measuring economic importance

1132
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,100
or are you measuring economic control?

1133
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:18,940
- Yeah.

1134
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:26,940
[ Inaudible ]

1135
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,940
>> Yeah, that was also the kind of, yeah, there's a hub and spoke system.

1136
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:34,940
People write about papers flying where you don't want to go.

1137
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,940
So it doesn't really connect.

1138
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,940
I mean, there's a lot of people in the break.

1139
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:42,940
Yeah, I think it's not necessarily to do anything there.

1140
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,940
Yeah. And you'll write this.

1141
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:51,940
[INAUDIBLE]

1142
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:55,420
Yeah, yes, yes, absolutely.

1143
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:55,900
Yeah, OK.

1144
01:14:55,900 --> 01:15:00,900
So I mean, at first sight, you can do something

1145
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,100
because it's a kind of intuitive picture here,

1146
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:06,540
especially when you look at the front top of the hierarchy.

1147
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:11,260
So you find that New York and London is actually there.

1148
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,660
But then you quite quickly go into all kinds of anomalies.

1149
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:21,660
Yeah, these hub airports that are not necessarily relevant.

1150
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:25,620
There is destinations which tell us something about economic importance,

1151
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:30,300
but not necessarily about the importance in terms of controlling the global economy,

1152
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,900
which is kind of a different kind of process.

1153
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:40,660
Yeah, I was going to say something else about that, but it's, yeah, I forgot about it.

1154
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:45,420
Yeah, so we can also think about new data collections.

1155
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:49,540
And so your bitcoins is one brain.

1156
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,660
And I want to pick your brain a little bit more on that.

1157
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:55,580
But before that, I mean, just saying that one

1158
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:58,300
of the big struggles in the 1990s that research

1159
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,100
is where researchers work on front with.

1160
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,820
And this is still the case today.

1161
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:05,620
And you'll probably notice in some of your courses

1162
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:08,700
is that a lot of the statistics are collected

1163
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:11,260
at the state level and not necessarily

1164
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,020
at the urban level.

1165
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:17,260
And Peter Taylor, the by now emeritus professor

1166
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,500
that founded the globalization and multidisciplinary

1167
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,620
network always referred to this notion of state

1168
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,700
districts.

1169
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,500
It connected to statistics and indicators

1170
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,180
that were collected by the national state

1171
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:31,380
to measure the national economy, et cetera, et cetera.

1172
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,300
And at some point, the centrality of cities,

1173
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:38,940
in economic process, has only creeped in slightly.

1174
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:42,020
So we have sometimes at the national level

1175
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:46,860
indicate about cities, but then intercity connections

1176
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:48,060
and flows, it's very hard.

1177
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,540
Think about trade flows, for instance,

1178
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,020
(speaking in foreign language)

1179
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,940
It's between national economies,

1180
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:56,940
but if we have to assume them probably,

1181
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:00,140
the major metropolitan areas will be more tight

1182
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,660
in this growth and others.

1183
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,500
Yes.

1184
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,700
(mumbles)

1185
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,700
But the previous slide,

1186
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:07,220
in the beginning African-

1187
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:10,220
[INAUDIBLE]

1188
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,220
Sorry.

1189
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,220
Yeah.

1190
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:15,440
We have a lot of resource

1191
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,460
extraction happening in these places.

1192
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,940
No, but these--

1193
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,340
I mean, it's always a question.

1194
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,740
I will return to that.

1195
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,020
The power of representation.

1196
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:33,380
This is the result of where you cut off the list at some point.

1197
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,500
So it's the most connected places

1198
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,900
It's just a sense of passenger flows.

1199
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,900
But there's another realizer on upgrading that.

1200
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1201
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,700
Absolutely.

1202
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,700
How do you get the rear screw?

1203
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:49,300
Well, you can turn it around, and you can focus on Africa.

1204
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:53,660
African cities and how they're connected in global, global

1205
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,460
airline afterwards.

1206
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:58,500
So you can do some kind of if you will, but not the analysis.

1207
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,660
It's actually something that we did that look at the

1208
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:03,540
evolution of African cities globally.

1209
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:09,540
airline networks, and it could tell you, give you a hint about how these places are

1210
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:15,500
according to nationalizing globalizing through their airline networks, which you can then

1211
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,140
could still be a very rough figure.

1212
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:24,020
And it would also, as we found, capture all kinds of processes, the liberalization of the

1213
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:30,980
airline industry in Africa, rather than the increasing importance of some cities in the global

1214
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:36,940
So yeah, just to give you an idea of what is the trouble when you start looking for

1215
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:42,860
your kind of data, you perhaps can think a little bit about what other kinds of approximations

1216
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:43,860
you could use.

1217
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:50,500
And that was exactly kind of a conundrum or thing that people were chewing on in the 1990s

1218
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:57,300
and as it became evident at some kind of new metajography was needed.

1219
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:02,300
I'm using metagography in a sense that it refers to

1220
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,980
associate spatial structure, if you will,

1221
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,140
it helps to make sense of the world.

1222
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:12,140
So it's a geography that explains how processes work.

1223
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:16,860
Like the nation states tells us something

1224
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:17,960
about what extent

1225
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:24,540
either sectarian politics is able to territorialize,

1226
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:34,420
need to make it difficult. Whereas perhaps the world city network tries to capture the

1227
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:41,740
integrated fashion of economic processes. And this is actually what Manuel Castelles was

1228
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:47,580
writing about in the 1990s when we were talking about this space of flows which he put into

1229
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:53,980
opposition with the space of places. So he said, well, we have this traditional view of the world

1230
01:19:53,980 --> 01:20:01,180
as a mosaic of territorial states which are kind of yeah if you put them together you get the

1231
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:09,740
world map but there's another kind of geography that is out there which is discontinuous so it's

1232
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:15,260
kind of it's another continuous space these are kind of islands if you will that are connected

1233
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:23,820
to flows of goods, people, money, knowledge etc etc so this is kind of character

1234
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,580
rising the space of flow.

1235
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:28,560
And it's kind of, it's a socialization process,

1236
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,820
a sociologist.

1237
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:34,060
So it's a society emerging on that.

1238
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:38,460
And it was kind of kind of visionary.

1239
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,460
But I, he intended to be visionary in a sense

1240
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:42,980
that this would be the norm.

1241
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:45,900
So we would be the common network society.

1242
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,900
We can wonder about that.

1243
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,140
But what is kind of still relevant, I think,

1244
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:53,020
is that there's a tension between these spaces of flows.

1245
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:56,360
So these islands of connected urban areas,

1246
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:02,500
which is to some degree detached from a mosaic of city stance.

1247
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:06,060
And there's all kinds of oppositions between that.

1248
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,500
If you look at the election map in the UK,

1249
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,700
none of the election map, the referendum map.

1250
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:17,020
And you look at the leaf or remain float,

1251
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:20,980
it was clear that London wanted to stay in,

1252
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:23,620
which tells us something about the importance

1253
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,820
of being remaining connected to,

1254
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,420
we'd say other financial centers

1255
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,100
on the European continent.

1256
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,780
The rest of Britain, I mean, summarizing now,

1257
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:34,380
was against that,

1258
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,420
which shows that there's a disconnect in the daily lives

1259
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:41,700
of people to the interest of a city.

1260
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:46,700
I'm not saying that the leaf campaign

1261
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,060
actually connected to the real needs of Brits,

1262
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:50,700
but that's another kind of discussion, okay?

1263
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:54,380
So this space of flows served as a kind of new metagogy

1264
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:57,340
which then was an impetus to start collecting new data,

1265
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:02,340
which ultimately brings me to the raw curiosity

1266
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,940
and I'll try to be as brief as possible in the interest of time.

1267
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:09,100
It's also not something that you need to...

1268
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,660
No, you don't study this by heart,

1269
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:16,100
but it's a way to kind of appreciate a certain methodology.

1270
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:22,500
So just go to this website once, at least.

1271
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,740
It's hosted by Lovedra University in East England

1272
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:28,380
and then the Midlands.

1273
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:34,580
It's a very interesting source for urban level case studies

1274
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:37,620
on connectivity between cities.

1275
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,860
It can also use for other courses, I think,

1276
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:42,940
of the course by bus, for instance.

1277
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:46,500
So it's quite an inventory of nice case

1278
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,340
that is there.

1279
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:50,980
So what's the starting point of this, you can say,

1280
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:53,700
project by globalization and what's

1281
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:58,380
the research network was, is let's take APS firms

1282
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:05,340
as the clearest indicator species of this new space of flows.

1283
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,140
So there's a new space of flows that

1284
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:11,260
characterize how the global economy and global society works.

1285
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:15,300
And as we read Castell's Sosen, it's very likely

1286
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,260
that if we use these corporations,

1287
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:23,260
we'll be able to indicate a command and control functions

1288
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,100
of cities.

1289
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,700
So the starting point are the geographies of APS firms

1290
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:32,420
that tell us something about world and global cities.

1291
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,380
The reason is, as I explained earlier,

1292
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:37,220
these APS firms are in and of themselves.

1293
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:41,100
International players, they have a global city geography,

1294
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,820
if you will, so it makes sense to start looking

1295
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:53,500
And the idea is that you can actually build a model on the basis of these APS

1296
01:23:53,500 --> 01:24:00,620
geographies and the model is based on the co-presence, the shared presence of

1297
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:04,380
APS firms in multiple cities.

1298
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:09,740
Summarized is one firm in Brussels and London.

1299
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:14,220
It will make connection between these two cities and we can assume that it will

1300
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:21,180
will be so kind of flow of probably emails, telephone calls, ideas, there will be

1301
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:25,500
second-man's, people will travel between these officers, money will flow between

1302
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:31,720
these officers, etc. So the shared presence of APS firm in multiple cities, so

1303
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:36,860
one firm being located in multiple cities. So in a three-step spirit with any

1304
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:41,420
model you need to specify it, then you can measure it, it's filling it to a data,

1305
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:45,420
And then hopefully something comes out of this model.

1306
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,420
Okay?

1307
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:50,420
So, yeah, how does GOC solve it?

1308
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,420
So, just as a random example,

1309
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:56,420
a number of global or rural cities,

1310
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:59,420
New York, London, Brussels, Kuala Lumpur,

1311
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:05,420
and these are kind of contained spaces with a number of firms in there.

1312
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:08,420
And these are APS firms.

1313
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:11,500
And so there's the mobile, this thing, cities,

1314
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,660
and they host APS firms.

1315
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:16,420
Some of these firms are actually the same, okay?

1316
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:21,420
So we have by now transformed corporations

1317
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,460
such as Arthur Anderson, resident bank,

1318
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,860
Kiffin Chan, the law firm,

1319
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,220
Booth, Allen, Hamilton, noise,

1320
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,740
that's insurance company.

1321
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,940
But just to give you some questions.

1322
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:33,740
So how is it specified?

1323
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:34,740
What does God do?

1324
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,460
It says, well, oh, there's a firm here

1325
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:42,460
in London or Brussels, how important is this firm actually?

1326
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:46,180
Okay, so you try to measure this in an objective,

1327
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:49,020
or at least standardize way so that you make the same

1328
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:52,180
per every time, or that you write every time.

1329
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:55,980
So you say, okay, for this one office in Brussels

1330
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,700
by Barclays or something or HSBC, a bank,

1331
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,940
how important is it?

1332
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:03,420
And we use a very standard scale, zero to five,

1333
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:06,420
no offense are easy, you give it a zero.

1334
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:10,140
Oh, it's the global headquarters, that is a fine, okay?

1335
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:12,860
It's the only agency, but it would be, I don't know,

1336
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:16,980
KBC or something like that, large belting back, okay?

1337
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:19,580
And then there's a whole range in between.

1338
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,820
A typical office would be two,

1339
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:24,660
maybe a regional headquarters, and there's a lot of those

1340
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:28,760
and Brussels that actually control European activities

1341
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,340
would be a three or four.

1342
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:34,340
So this is kind of the idea.

1343
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:37,220
There's a hierarchy in office functions

1344
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:40,060
and we can measure this in a standardized way.

1345
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:43,260
If you have service values,

1346
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:48,060
you can also imagine what the importance of the connection

1347
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:50,740
between two offices would be.

1348
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:54,460
So a very important office and Brussels,

1349
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:56,980
and a very important office in London

1350
01:26:56,980 --> 01:27:01,500
would probably generate more traffic in terms of emails

1351
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,780
some phone calls, which is then again a proxy

1352
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:07,460
for, you could say, the importance of the activities

1353
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,180
in global command language.

1354
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:13,420
So it's basically calculating the intercity relation

1355
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:18,260
the R value there by multiplying the service values.

1356
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:21,260
And so very basic, so you have a very important time

1357
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:24,740
is a very important one, if you are very strong relation

1358
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,100
between these two places.

1359
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,100
OK.

1360
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:28,820
I'm going to get like that.

1361
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:29,860
Can I imagine the connection?

1362
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:33,580
So they took a line, the more important connection

1363
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,340
between these kind of offices.

1364
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:41,020
And you can populate a complete matrix with that.

1365
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:44,460
You can do that in the filter until you drop that,

1366
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,420
or you don't have the energy to look for more information

1367
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,700
on office networks.

1368
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,700
So this is kind of the basic one.

1369
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,620
And it allows you to do, for instance,

1370
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:57,620
this guy thinks that there's three cities in this very short list

1371
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,900
New York Singapore and the app work.

1372
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,920
And they have these different front

1373
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,140
and it gets from ABC and D.

1374
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:08,340
And we can could imagine a novel where you say, okay.

1375
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:13,340
And for a global office in New York,

1376
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:16,460
a very important office,

1377
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,300
or a regular office in Singapore,

1378
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:18,620
and a regular office in

1379
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:23,780
and it would be a bit different for BC and D.

1380
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:28,700
So just one example, I'll see there.

1381
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:34,460
What you can then do is start to measure the connectivity

1382
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:36,020
of cities.

1383
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:40,700
Thus far we've been talking about first

1384
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:43,940
and what the importance of the city has for a firm.

1385
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:46,100
You can also think about what is now

1386
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:49,820
the strength of a city's connection based

1387
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:52,260
on the presence of first.

1388
01:28:52,260 --> 01:29:00,100
What you do is you basically summarize all these different types between cities for one

1389
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,100
one six.

1390
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:04,020
It sounds a bit complex but it's really easy.

1391
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:10,780
So what you would do is think about the connection between different cities on the base

1392
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:11,940
of the corporate networks.

1393
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:19,060
So think about five times two plus five times two would be the connectivity generated

1394
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:22,260
by first-grown, so you can be four times two.

1395
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:25,740
Your, you'll be five times one.

1396
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:29,460
And in this step, I think I was five.

1397
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:33,460
And in some, you would get a figure of 40.

1398
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,740
It's purely irrelevant example,

1399
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:38,580
but it would give you the highest connectivity

1400
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:41,300
in this model, right?

1401
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:42,820
And then for the other kind of cities,

1402
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:44,900
we could do similar exercises,

1403
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,320
and for it would be generating

1404
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:53,000
activities for a and even just a low presence on its front. But you would generate

1405
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,960
someone activity for eight and for a. And also summarize that. And what you could

1406
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:04,520
also do is express this as a proportion of most connected city in this tiny

1407
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:10,200
example of New York. And you would get to say, well, enter is four times

1408
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:15,400
connected as well as New York. So New York is is our leading

1409
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:19,320
We'll sit here, then we have Singapore and then Andrew.

1410
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:25,160
So a very, very small example to tell you how the structure is.

1411
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:29,240
Service values, thinking about connections between cities,

1412
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,960
and then summarizing these connections.

1413
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:36,600
And that gives us an overall view of the connectivity of the city in the world,

1414
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,720
sitting there.

1415
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,920
So we have specified the model.

1416
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:47,920
And then you can start measuring it and filling it with data.

1417
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:52,080
And how has GOC done this?

1418
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:56,320
Well, specification obviously refers to the APS firms.

1419
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:01,200
And this kind of nice is that this measurement

1420
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,480
has occurred several times since, I think, 2,000,

1421
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,080
but every time in the same way.

1422
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,840
So it kind of definitions of categories

1423
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,120
of these kind of APS sectors has been in the same,

1424
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,840
and has been numerous kind of reiterations

1425
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,680
of these measures.

1426
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:21,040
So five sectors are connected to SELSA's interpretation.

1427
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,520
Can't see advertising, financial services, insurance,

1428
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,840
law, management, and so forth.

1429
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:31,840
Basically, what God does is the leading firms, 175 firms,

1430
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:38,360
based on Forbes and other kinds of corporate lists,

1431
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:44,040
that tells something about turnover, the size of these folks, et cetera, et cetera, are

1432
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:47,280
kind of selected.

1433
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:53,760
And then what is also done is, yeah, you could do this with an infinite number of cities.

1434
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,880
Well, not infinite, but a very large list of cities.

1435
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:03,600
But to avoid a bit of, I don't know, it's not biased, but to get a manageable data set,

1436
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:08,940
You could say the largest cities or what we know from certain countries as economically

1437
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,440
and important cities are selected in this list.

1438
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:15,360
So it's not a purely inductive exercise.

1439
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:20,120
It's kind of an informed decision to include some cities and other products.

1440
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:27,840
So all the firms, a lot of cities, and then on the basis of information that we can find

1441
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:36,000
on corporate websites, we made a decision as to how important offices are. And then you

1442
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:44,880
can basically start filling the entire matrix. So just an example to share how this works.

1443
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:49,680
I mean, you think about just look at the website, can be quite tough, but you can actually

1444
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:56,720
hold all of these websites, find very detailed information at the address level of these

1445
01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:01,360
offices and all of these corporations are very proud that they're located in the

1446
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:08,480
meeting world city is kind of a brand new so quite often you can fly down yes

1447
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:15,840
yes you avoid the deforestation that's a very good idea

1448
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:22,560
I think yeah I'm not sure whether it's going to take away all the noise that

1449
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:30,640
that's what you're internet. So yeah, so it's a really accessible source of information,

1450
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:38,880
but obviously it's also a bit of a guesswork and you need to come up with some kind of

1451
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:46,800
interpretive guide to meet these websites and to make decisions as to how you will

1452
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:55,440
give attached value to these phrases. Okay, just one, and then you can build these kind of

1453
01:33:55,440 --> 01:34:03,040
matrices. So all of them are all of countries, a lot of cities. And then you can start applying

1454
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:08,400
that problem. Okay, so it's an approximation of the importance of cities in these corporate networks,

1455
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:15,760
and it has the level of kind of sustained analysis or modeling of these interactions on that

1456
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:24,640
basis. And then maybe already have seen these kind of maps. So a lot of world-saving network research

1457
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:30,800
then start to look into the actual geographies that are being produced. So this is some research

1458
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:40,560
from a while ago. It just shows the absolute levels of connectivity, so the global network connectivity,

1459
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:48,320
and the darker pieces are the most connected places and then the lower the light colors by the

1460
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:55,760
less one place. So it gives you an idea. Take a good look at this map. What you learn from that

1461
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:09,760
or what you find striking anything striking here. Does it confirm what you thought? You learned

1462
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:38,760
Can you think? Yeah? No? Yes? I don't really get a comment on the situation. I said, "If I do this, or if you do this, the word happens. There are not a few routines in this." So, where there's so many neuroships. If you think that you said that you can kind of think of the largest in these things, you do a piece of permanent largest in the number of populations.

1463
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:39,760
I know.

1464
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,760
No.

1465
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:43,640
So, but it's a list.

1466
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,480
So there's a number of criteria.

1467
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:51,040
I mean, population is one, but it's also in certain countries.

1468
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:56,440
I mean, it's also looking for its business, its written down economic importance.

1469
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:04,920
So in Belgium, it would also include these entities, which is absolutely not a two million

1470
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:09,280
in happen in the city so but we know it has important opportunities.

1471
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:13,640
Now just to be clear, these are not 525 cities,

1472
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,160
but it's a selection I think it's 123.

1473
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:20,160
So it's focusing on the most important cities,

1474
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:24,560
which as a result, apparently gifts,

1475
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,400
a geography that is skewed towards,

1476
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,840
it's a Northern America Western Europe

1477
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,440
and then has a bit of presence elsewhere.

1478
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:45,440
>> Yeah. >> I'm just thinking, like, this thing is like, about 50, just, yeah, I think, like, it's like that.

1479
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:50,440
Like, it's like a whole life, like, you know, in relationship that a global that type of business.

1480
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,440
Like, I don't know if you have a good case. >> Yeah, absolutely.

1481
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:55,440
>> You know, that's a good case. >> For making sense, you know, which I found in a bit,

1482
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,440
a lot lower probably not, but the money, but like, how many people, you know,

1483
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:07,640
>> I agree 300%.

1484
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:13,680
So the question is, does this represent cities and globalization or does it represent

1485
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:17,280
the location strategies of APS first?

1486
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,080
And to what extent is this the same?

1487
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:24,400
So the question is to what extent do you go along and

1488
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:30,480
claim that it gets from foreign indicators species of commandment control. I think to some extent

1489
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:35,520
this is the case but there's clearly other processes but I think and that's something that we'll

1490
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:43,120
return to later on. We have to I think another key distinguish between say more economic drug

1491
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:48,720
a few readings whereas there's also more urban studies critiques some people say that you're not

1492
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:53,600
capturing globalization here. And this whole process we should look at?

1493
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:58,480
Yes, that's true. But it doesn't discredit one particular reading or one particular focus on the

1494
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:03,520
process, as long as we're clear about what it is that measures and what it is it has. But I

1495
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:09,440
completely example that remitances, I'll return to that in a second, is very appropriate.

1496
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:16,080
So this we have to be careful that we were not switched to some kind of imperial

1497
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,560
act here to try to claim that one process dominates something, but it was a specific

1498
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:33,680
equation. Same here is the same period that's a kind of comparison between two periods in time.

1499
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:40,240
I mean there was a data collection that allows analysis in 2000 and I'm just before the crisis

1500
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:45,120
in 2008, I mean the previous crisis, we get them all.

1501
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:50,120
So comparing the structure of the world city network,

1502
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:52,620
which is effectively on the aggregate level,

1503
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:58,620
the structure of corporate strategies and the interpretive fees.

1504
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:02,620
And I mean it's kind of interesting to see that even before

1505
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:06,020
the Euro-American or North Atlantic financial crisis,

1506
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:09,920
there was already a shift going on in terms of strategic importance

1507
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:14,020
of cities in the east, and I mean both in eastern Europe,

1508
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:18,620
and the global east, so I'm talking about Chinese cities,

1509
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:23,420
for instance, so if regions were interested in secular shifts

1510
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:25,940
within the structure of the world economy,

1511
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:29,980
it shows that it's also reflected in the corporate geographies

1512
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:34,220
of these ATS firms, which knowing that they're

1513
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:37,260
important inputs for global corporations

1514
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:40,300
There's something about developments on these cities

1515
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:44,060
in how capital circulates on the global scale.

1516
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,860
So it tells us something that everything,

1517
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:52,180
and that's also why Rob uses heuristic.

1518
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,780
And there's some modesty connected to that.

1519
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,740
Heuristic is a kind of a starting point.

1520
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:59,300
As a searching device, where he's like,

1521
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:04,300
oh, what the hell is going on in, let's say, lightly?

1522
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:06,900
It's dark reds.

1523
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,380
What could be the process going on?

1524
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:12,020
How does it explain that-- how do you explain that it's

1526

1527

hub between that in America and a northern America?

1529
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:26,900
Is why is it losing its functions?

1530
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:29,380
Is it because Latin America is becoming

1531
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:35,060
less important for northern American capital?

1532
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:36,100
what could be going on there?

1533
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:39,940
I mean, you can think about numerous other examples there.

1534
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,460
And it should be, I think, and that's

1535
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:44,780

And a difference set to a different set of methods.

1537
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:50,660
You could do a case study, follow the thing,

1538
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:53,340
follow your nose, and try to problematize

1539

these kinds of findings.

1540
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:58,420
But it's a way to refer to her back to that.

1541
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:00,900
And it gives you-- that's, I think, he added value,

1542
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,780
some kind of standardized overview.

1543
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:12,860

1544
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:17,300

1545
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:22,860
we won't take 25 minutes but maybe 20 minutes if I'm lucky?

1546
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:28,460
Is that okay or do you want to break? Why is this going to be there?

1547
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:35,660
Yes you can. Yeah, is there a collective need for a restroom break?

1548
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:44,460
Is that a yes hand? Yeah, two minutes because we really because we can't take too much time.

So yeah, this one's in that view of breach should appreciate by now a long tradition of

1602
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:42,300
rural and global cities research, then this kind of severity informed the general by

1603

core.

1604
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:49,020
But at some point, and especially the early technologies, there was a danger that, or at

1605
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:54,260
least this recent agenda was, was in terms of this, you could say dominant or hedge

1606
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:58,420
of monitoring the wind in urban studies or for citizens in global

1607
01:48:58,420 --> 01:49:05,860
ization. And as such, it's also raised quite a bit of criticism. And I think it's debatable

1608
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:10,100
to what extent this is just quite some points of this. Certainly as other points, I think

1609
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:15,620
I'm personally, but I'm also kind of involved in these debates a bit more in the wild.

1610
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:20,500
I'll just take you through them. And I hope to do so within the next 20 minutes.

1611
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:28,180
Right, I think we can say, I still think that the aristarch can be powerful to the map and

1612
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:34,260
spatially analyze global connections, but clearly something can be said that. I'll just skip that

1613
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:40,580
and cut the business. One of the most important things and most French and critiques

1614
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:48,340
I think it was Lawrence, I think the beginning of the notice by a famous scholar Jennifer Robinson,

1615
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:59,620
South African working from London, wrote a book, Ordinary Cities. However, papers was

1616
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:04,580
World Cities or a World of Cities where she kind of

1617
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:12,260
was with frustrated with this dominance of world cities research

1618
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:14,780
in the debate about city city globalization.

1619
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:17,660
And it says, and she says, well, it's quite a different thing

1620
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:21,100
about world cities for the globalization of cities more

1621
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:22,580
wide.

1622
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:25,820
And that's good reasons for this difference,

1623
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:29,220
or the lack of what world and global cities

1624
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:30,020
research was doing.

1625
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:33,020
Then in addressing cities in globalization,

1626
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:38,020
Since I've seen the map, a lot of the cities around the globe,

1627
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:39,580
and especially in the global south,

1628
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:44,340
are basically dropped off a physical, natural map, right?

1629
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:48,060
So we find that there's a lot of connectivity

1630
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:50,700
in your Western Western European,

1631
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:52,820
or the American Asian cities,

1632
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:55,220
but it's actually very little to be told

1633
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:59,420
about African cities that basically not represent the environment.

1634
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:02,380
So an issue of representation there,

1635
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:11,500
in her view, but it also deals with how we conceptualize world and world cities.

1636
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:18,140
And in her argument, we focused too much on a limited number of economic processes,

1637
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:21,780
whereas all the kinds of connections remain unsteaded.

1638
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:26,660
One of the examples that was already given was, yeah, you can look at remittances,

1639
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:30,620
and you would get a completely different view, perhaps,

1640
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:34,100
on these carbon networks.

1641
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:38,500
So how kind of claim is that, by doing so,

1642
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:42,140
by these, say, geographical and sexual biases,

1643
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:43,620
well, cities of search has ignored

1644
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:45,700
the wrong position of numerous ordinary cities

1645
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:46,980
in the global economy.

1646
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:52,140
And there's a tendency to, you could say, offer

1647
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:54,860
a Eurocentric global city theory,

1648
01:51:54,860 --> 01:51:58,980
and then projecting that other areas of the world.

1649
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:02,100
So, a postcolonial critique,

1650
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,380
it's concerned with, you can say,

1651
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:09,380
power relations in the production of theories and concepts.

1652
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:14,620
And how these concepts and theories are reproducing

1653
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:17,300
existing inequalities.

1654
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:19,820
And these are also geographical,

1655
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:23,740
so it's social, spatial, and even as the global scale.

1656
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:27,540
If we keep on kind of reiterating the dominance

1657
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:31,220
of certain kinds of activities, come up with certain kind

1658
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:34,500
of maps, measuring things in a certain way,

1659
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:37,980
in the anthropod of the process and part of the body,

1660
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:39,740
if you will.

1661
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:44,140
So I think there's certainly an argument to be made there.

1662
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:48,100
I think representation is problematic in my own research

1663
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:50,460
that was also kind of the starting point

1664
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:51,820
of why it was interested in looking

1665
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:56,820
into Islamic finance as a way to understand Middle Eastern.

1666
01:52:56,820 --> 01:53:02,500
World's deformation process is not to a traditional lens

1667
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:05,700
of the classic APS firms, but to look at, okay,

1668
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:09,420
to what extent or local norms and ethics,

1669
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:12,120
religious and other regarding finance,

1670
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:18,300
giving rise to a global sector in an overt zone,

1671
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,180
that could then also start,

1672
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:22,660
So I was in the back interurban connections.

1673
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:27,380
That was kind of what I did in my own work on Islamic finance.

1674
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:31,780
So I certainly am extremely sensitive to this autumn.

1675
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:35,260
But at the same time, we also have to be clear

1676
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:39,420
that part of this criticism perhaps also out of place.

1677
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:42,980
I think Jennifer Robinson really starts from an urban studies

1678
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:46,780
critique, which you also understand.

1679
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:49,300
You can say globalization and its plurality,

1680
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:53,220
not just economic but otherwise and even within economic processes,

1681
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:56,780
or why diversity, rests for God.

1682
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:59,500
I think that the purposes, how can we understand

1683
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,300
the reproduction of uneven development

1684
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:05,740
on a global scale, at least in the free-to-manion tradition,

1685
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:10,020
where it was about how can we explain the fact

1686
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:13,300
that there's still under development

1687
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:17,540
and on the rate that the Frank serves in the global south,

1688
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:19,460
does it have something to do with the support

1689
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:23,940
and position of these cities in macro processes,

1690
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:26,020
macro capitalist process?

1691
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:30,780
So is it something with the extraction of value,

1692
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:32,780
organized through these corporate networks

1693
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:36,060
and supported by these previous firms that actually explains

1694
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:38,100
why these cities are not on the map?

1695
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,700
So is this a result?

1696
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:43,780
Is this not a neglect of these places?

1697
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:46,420
The fact that these places are not represented means

1698
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:50,020
either bypassed by these core protectors

1699
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:53,740
or that they potentially are subordinate in those process.

1700
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:56,780
Which could then be a question of, is this really case?

1701
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:59,620
Can we look into these processes?

1702
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:02,900
So sometimes a bit of a confusion, I think,

1703
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:05,420
between kind of a deliberate choice,

1704
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,620
not only include certain places

1705
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:09,860
whereas some of these maps are actually to be taken

1706
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:12,860
as a result of a critical analysis.

1707
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:17,060
I do agree that in a number of,

1708
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:20,060
You could say analysis that are more technical in nature,

1709
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:22,580
in terms of the world city network,

1710
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:25,620
this kind of critical edge was sometimes lost.

1711
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:29,460
And there's a kind of mission drift towards mapping networks,

1712
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:31,740
whereas the connection to process of uneven development

1713
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:32,980
was less clear,

1714
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:36,460
it's a bit of my personal crusade

1715
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:41,140
to make the connection to the critical agenda again.

1716
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:42,700
So this, but certainly,

1717
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:46,940
Jennifer Robinson points us to be very clear

1718
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:49,940
clear about what it is that we are measuring

1719
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:52,660
to this kind of growth analysis and what we're not.

1720
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:55,580
So it's about placing them at these kind of methods

1721
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:58,460
in a wider, you can say,

1722
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:02,940
a firmament of methods to work with that.

1723
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:07,660
Now, with this also connect to what kind of practice

1724
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:10,900
we wish to endorse within the tradition

1725
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:14,420
of urban studies, in the sense that,

1726
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:19,420
And this is kind of our personal disappointment

1727
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:23,420
with a lot of research that has followed the work

1728
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:26,420
by Jennifer Robinson, the version for Amazon itself.

1729
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:30,300
But there's a lot of tendency with we're which Jennifer or Jenny.

1730
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:35,020
And a very reductionist representation

1731
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:36,660
of her legitimate claims.

1732
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:39,460
And we actually wrote a paper about this

1733
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:41,420
with these religious title,

1734
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:48,420
to kind of throw that and speak, where we kind of deal with distilling what is kind of

1735
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:52,380
justified criticism and where we think it's a bit too much.

1736
01:56:52,380 --> 01:57:00,300
And what we particularly regret is that some of the criticism has led to disengaged or

1737
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:06,700
a plumberism where it's a kind of rejection, so in the genus to do something else without

1738
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:10,260
taking stock about of the knowledge that is produced here.

1739
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:16,260
So what we try to then propose is some kind of a middle ground is a more engaged form

1740
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:21,880
of urban studies debate, which also means that you say yes, these kind of global white

1741
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:24,280
analysis or well-setty research.

1742
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:29,340
In general, we need to put it in its place, but it doesn't mean that we can try to work

1743
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:35,260
at this concept to make sense of places beyond the short list of world cities.

1744
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:42,260
It would be that I'm battling and I'm defending and explaining myself in different kind of race and unnecessary race.

1745
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:45,260
But let me try to make it work clear.

1746
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:47,260
Because they are very rude.

1747
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:51,260
Manila. We don't need world safety concepts.

1748
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:55,260
The world city is a Euro mountain invention.

1749
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:57,260
I can't do anything with that.

1750
01:57:57,260 --> 01:58:00,260
It could be something that you could say.

1751
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:06,740
We need a conflict of the Middle Eastern city of the Asian city because everything is particular

1752
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:13,100
and then we need to build that theory and then it's so unique in particular that you can't land.

1753
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:23,460
So people disagree and say, look, there's no one-on-one projection of world city formation as a process

1754
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:27,220
on a city like the Hudefur instance or Manila.

1755
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:33,140
But we'll have to work with the concept to see to what extent it does explain something

1756
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:35,740
of what we find and what extent it doesn't.

1757
01:58:35,740 --> 01:58:44,180
And perhaps we need to enhance or tailor that first find the concept.

1758
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:49,740
And in the process, we potentially may even learn something about the place that we study.

1759
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:55,300
But at least we still remain in the position that we can speak back to the original debate,

1760
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:57,360
which is I think the point of urban studies

1761
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:58,840
that were not lost in translation,

1762
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:02,940
will try to connect with some kind of organ eye

1763
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:04,540
or overarching debate,

1764
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:07,280
even if you're studying very diverse places.

1765
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:11,340
- Now, yeah, I won't say too much about this two cases

1766
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:13,880
because it's also part of our discussion seminar,

1767
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:17,740
but just to point out the kind of contrasting cases.

1768
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:19,660
So in one paper we looked at the LUTs,

1769
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:22,620
which is kind of interesting place.

1770
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:25,700
we put a more by exact,

1771
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:28,580
that role-to-information process.

1772
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:34,300
So what you see is a built environment with skyscrapers.

1773
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:39,940
They obviously took a hit and are taking a serious hit currently

1774
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:43,780
with the entire term of the country, isn't.

1775
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:46,180
But on the first side, say, OK,

1776
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:49,540
there's actually, when you start looking at APS activities,

1777
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:51,620
it's actually very little going on there.

1778
01:59:51,620 --> 01:59:56,980
There's a lot of very little regional headquarters, the ferry there were international firms.

1779
01:59:56,980 --> 02:00:07,700
But when you then start looking into yes remittance flows and the Aspara, you find that almost one-fifth of Lebanese economy is made of these remittances.

1780
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:19,540
And a lot of it faces that, to a BS professionals, that are located in the Gulf so it's our McKinsey trained, but agreed consultants, McKinsey's living,

1781
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:23,940
that is them advising the Saudis or people in Dubai, the elite leader of Dubai,

1782
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:31,460
that earn their money there, send back their money and buy a hugely overpriced apartment

1783
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:36,980
in the city centre of the Greenhouse. The real estate market which is then

1784
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:42,500
kept artificially booming by almost free credit from the central bank of Lebanon,

1785
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:48,420
which is also the personal property of the living families of Lebanon.

1786
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:51,700
So it's kind of connected.

1787
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:55,860
Now in any case, it shows you that if you follow your nose,

1788
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:58,860
in a sense, there's still awesome characteristics

1789
02:00:58,860 --> 02:01:02,420
of world to deformation, especially in the role

1790
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:04,340
of a high-skilled labor.

1791
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:05,860
But it's a kind of--

1792
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:09,500
it's in some of the parts of regional capacity building,

1793
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:13,860
regional circuits of failure that are kind of connected

1794
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:15,660
back to the city.

1795
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:20,940
So it's function as a capital sink to the region,

1796
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:24,620
rather than as a kind of server service in the liveries.

1797
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:27,180
If you look at Manila, it's kind of the opposite.

1798
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:29,620
You'd say, wow, a lot of activities there,

1799
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:32,300
a lot of APS firms, they're all there.

1800
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:35,220
But then you suddenly into these activities,

1801
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:36,260
and there's something that you know,

1802
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:38,300
a collaborative has done.

1803
02:01:38,300 --> 02:01:41,540
It's basically part of the largest one of the largest

1804
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:45,220
outsourcing sectors of tendencies that you find.

1805
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:47,820
So a lot of back office activities,

1806
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:50,940
for global banks and other kind of service providers,

1807
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:54,180
but it's not really come up in control,

1808
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:56,580
or not at least not what we think of it.

1809
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:59,500
And it may also work through

1810
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:02,740
and what it can explain in terms of the segmentation

1811
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:03,580
of the labor market,

1812
02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:06,860
but because it would not be high-end managers

1813
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:09,100
that are then gentrifying neighborhoods,

1814
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:12,700
but it may arise through middle-class or something.

1815
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:17,100
So it may result in other kinds of labor market structures.

1816
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:20,020
But at least we can still refer back to world cities

1817
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:22,380
and start comparing to what is going on elsewhere.

1818
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:25,380
So this is an example of an encompassing approach

1819
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:29,820
to try to encompass diversity in your research design

1820
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:31,740
and try to make sense.

1821
02:02:31,740 --> 02:02:32,700
So that's how we solve it.

1822
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:34,380
I won't say anything more because I want

1823
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:38,860
to leave something for the debating session.

1824
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:45,860
The second point of criticism is social constructivity.

1825
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:50,900
Again, it's the same in the sense that representation matters.

1826
02:02:50,900 --> 02:02:55,740
And this is the great work by Dory Massey,

1827
02:02:55,740 --> 02:03:05,500
who was a transatlantic nice economic juggler for from the UK,

1828
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:07,260
thought about spatial divisions of labor

1829
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:11,660
was one of the leading voices in a lot of progressive debates

1830
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:14,460
in geography.

1831
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:18,700
And she also wrote a book, "World City in 2007,

1832
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:23,740
I wish kind of engaged with this agenda."

1833
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:31,460
And what she basically says in this book is, yeah,

1834
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:36,300
world cities are not just a given, an economic geographical

1835
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:40,260
reality based on, as we said, the clustering

1836
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:44,540
on these ABS firms, their labor markets, et cetera, et cetera.

1837
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:50,280
They are, but they're also a product of discourses,

1838
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:52,520
representation, et cetera, et cetera.

1839
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:58,660
So they're mediated by political interests, elites,

1840
02:03:58,660 --> 02:04:03,820
others, and other actors that project certain discourses

1841
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:10,380
about world and global cities and these also have ultimately performative effects.

1842
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:14,060
So they produce or go produce certain realities.

1843
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:17,060
It's a bit kind of knowledge theory.

1844
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:23,340
So the world is also to some extent shaped by how you represent this.

1845
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:28,460
And then you can be an ardent, very strong believer of that and say, okay, the world is

1846
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:30,020
almost exclusively,

1847
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:32,140
reducible to how we represented

1848
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:33,940
whereas others would work more in

1849
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:35,260
kind of materialist fragrance,

1850
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:37,580
okay, not everything is shaped by words, right?

1851
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:41,340
So I think I'm gonna look at the other,

1852
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:43,540
it's kind of something to think about

1853
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:46,580
toward extent, representation actually matters.

1854
02:04:46,580 --> 02:04:51,060
Now, Jourine explains this for London,

1855
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:53,860
and she says, yes, it's a globalized financial center,

1856
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:55,140
but the way you perceive it

1857
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:56,980
and the way the city reproduces itself

1858
02:04:56,980 --> 02:05:01,700
is the outcome of a decade-long battle of representation,

1859
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:04,860
which was led by government finance elites, politicians,

1860
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:10,300
not often not seldomly connected to all boys' networks

1861
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:13,820
that have been projecting the world city status of London.

1862
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:17,500
And this has become some kind of a hedge in life.

1863
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:21,940
Unquestioned, near-liberal growth strategy,

1864
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:26,340
has been part of that new liberal strategy since the eight.

1865
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:31,940
And the kind of ideas that what is good for the financial industry is good for the city.

1866
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:35,740
What's good for the city is good for London, what's good for London, what's good for the Saudis,

1867
02:05:35,740 --> 02:05:39,740
what is good for the Saudis is good for UK.

1868
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:48,340
And dear Europeans, what is good for the UK is also good for Europe, so please deregulate the Afghans.

1869
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:57,940
So it's a rhetorical strategy she calls the passport total where the part is there to represent the whole.

1870
02:05:57,940 --> 02:06:04,540
So it's the interest of the city of London which are projected to be the interest of the UK citizen.

1871
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:11,540
And again, as Brexit has shown, this has been quite radically rejected.

1872
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:16,940
Again, whether legitimately or not.

1873
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:23,960
So, yeah, there's this neoliberal growth strategy, and it also was connected to legitimate

1874
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:26,460
legitimate material decisions.

1875
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:32,100
In the sense that, if you look at this course, it's about dust, heat, growth, you need

1876
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,420
a new runway because of capacity issues.

1877
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:36,420
Yes.

1878
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:42,540
London cannot keep up with its global safety status or it cannot grow its connection to

1879
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:46,500
new emerging markets if it doesn't have an extra runway.

1880
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:53,500
So please, papers go away or needle your ears.

1881
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:57,100
But we absolutely need this.

1882
02:06:57,100 --> 02:07:00,620
And in global city discourse is there to justify it.

1883
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:02,700
But also when you look at the construction of the UK,

1884
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:07,500
colony in the '80s, I mean, closing the mines, et cetera,

1885
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:07,780
et cetera.

1886
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:11,340
And this has produced very uneven outcomes in the UK.

1887
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:13,780
A lot of cities in the north and opening

1888
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:15,580
mining areas in the industrial areas.

1889
02:07:15,580 --> 02:07:17,100
So decline.

1890
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:19,820
And at that point, what would have been interesting

1891
02:07:19,820 --> 02:07:24,260
is low interest rates, that could boost investment

1892
02:07:24,260 --> 02:07:27,380
to restructure these peripheral economies.

1893
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:28,220
That didn't happen.

1894
02:07:28,220 --> 02:07:30,540
And at that point, there was an inflation,

1895
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:33,620
there was high interest rates, which made,

1896
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:35,780
but simply money very expensive.

1897
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:39,540
And which made that it was very hard

1898
02:07:39,540 --> 02:07:41,580
to seek investment into these areas.

1899
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:43,820
And obviously, there was only interest of the Southeast,

1900
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:47,140
which generate an influence into financial services,

1901
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:52,140
et cetera, which then further grew global city London.

1902
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:54,940
So it's a particular political agenda

1903
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:58,420
that is behind there that has produced there.

1904
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:02,220
There are final points that we as academics

1905
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:06,420
or academics to be are not neutral bystanders

1906
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:08,860
and her claim is that especially when you start looking

1907
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:12,780
at these world city rankings that GOC

1908
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:14,780
is claimed to produce.

1909
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:16,060
This is part of the problem.

1910
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:19,580
It's kind of fueling the self-fuling prophecy

1911
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:23,700
as giving people in the city of Roman.

1912
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:25,500
The instruments that they exhibit to say,

1913
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:29,100
look, we're still leading city parts

1914
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:30,420
Dubai is closing.

1915
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:31,540
Please, come on.

1916
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:34,140
We need further investment in the city

1917
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:37,820
or we need the regulation or something like that.

1918
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:40,140
So that's kind of her also attention-preteaken

1919
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:47,140
in a sense that yes, world cities research is performative in that sense.

1920
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:52,140
So yeah, just a few slides there, and I'll return to that.

1921
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:58,620
I mean, the pictures that we have of representations that we have of London are the

1922
02:08:58,620 --> 02:09:03,340
glitz and glam quite often, and it's typically the city.

1923
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:08,140
But then how city is kept, the city of London is kept working on the wider metropolitan

1924
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:10,700
and how it remains often undiscovered

1925
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:13,380
or something that we'll talk about next week.

1926
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:18,380
- Yeah, and this is kind of battle of representation

1927
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:20,660
is ongoing, this is a bit of a data figure

1928
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:24,580
and still with Theresa May there

1929
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:28,020
who was going for a global Britain agenda.

1930
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:33,020
And again, you see that this kind of city elite

1931
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:36,740
is trying to push it in the whole campaign

1932
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:41,740
in a certain way, threatening to leave the city of London,

1933
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:45,300
which would then impact, you could say,

1934
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:49,180
the global city status of that city.

1935
02:09:49,180 --> 02:09:51,860
So it's kind of still the same repertoire

1936
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:56,860
that has been used at times when Brexit was still

1937
02:09:56,860 --> 02:10:01,660
unfinished business, probably not still not unfinished

1938
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:04,180
business, but for that.

1939
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:07,500
Now, I think, and then I really almost have the close

1940
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:10,420
performativity is a very important criticism.

1941
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:12,860
It's something that we should be very reflexive about.

1942
02:10:12,860 --> 02:10:16,220
It basically means the influence that it

1943
02:10:16,220 --> 02:10:19,060
reduce kind of figures that you could use the maps

1944
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:20,580
that you produced or what they spend

1945
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:22,620
to their shape and impact.

1946
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:24,940
Theality to what extent are they picked up?

1947
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:27,540
What is the responsibility of a researcher

1948
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:32,580
to keep ownership over his or her results?

1949
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:35,260
do we have an impact on that?

1950
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:37,460
And it's something that is also very important

1951
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:41,580
to reflect on in relation to world cities and global cities.

1952
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:44,900
And there I think my personal stance is that we should

1953
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:49,140
probably not exaggerate the influence of world

1954
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:51,100
and global cities research in the sense

1955
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:55,100
that it's only part of a much wider phenomenon

1956
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:58,260
of city rankings, et cetera, et cetera.

1957
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:00,260
And as you will start looking at it,

1958
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:05,100
It's often behaviors from themselves that come up with all kinds of rankings and they're

1959
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:13,580
much more picked up in popular debates, but for politicians that once again, a world in

1960
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:19,820
global cities status, provided and referring to GOG in and of itself.

1961
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:24,100
I mean, it would be a pleasure to actually know that people would meet economic papers,

1962
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:26,620
but I think it's actually quite limited.

1963
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:29,880
So yes, we need to be reflexive about them at the same time.

1964
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:32,180
It could give me a little bit overblown.

1965
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:35,860
And rankings are produced probably by other factors.

1966
02:11:35,860 --> 02:11:41,140
I'm sorry to run through this.

1967
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:42,540
Another point is--

1968
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:51,380
this is a criticism that deals with, to what extent,

1969
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:53,580
world and global cities takes into account,

1970
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:57,620
because of political economy processes,

1971
02:11:57,620 --> 02:12:00,460
or the politics of global city formation,

1972
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:05,100
I think that connects to the work of Dorian Massey.

1973
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:08,580
And it's kind of an agenda that was pushed

1974
02:12:08,580 --> 02:12:12,660
by new Brenner, especially at the end of the 1990s.

1975
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:15,140
And he says, well, it's not just economic geographies,

1976
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:18,700
it's not just agglomerations, clusters, et cetera, et cetera.

1977
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:20,900
What we need to account for is the restructuring

1978
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:27,500
of the economy and what he says, a rescaling of the nation state.

1979
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:31,100
So the way capitalism is being governed

1980
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:34,580
is not exclusively at the national scale,

1981
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:36,620
but something is happening at the same time

1982
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:38,220
it's becoming super national.

1983
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:40,700
So you get a whole kind of international organizations,

1984
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:43,180
IMF, OECD, et cetera, et cetera.

1985
02:12:43,180 --> 02:12:45,220
And Europe, Europe being union that starts

1986
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:49,420
to increasingly govern the economy.

1987
02:12:49,420 --> 02:12:53,080
And at the same time, there's a kind of devolution,

1988
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:56,340
growth in the importance of regions, of cities,

1989
02:12:56,340 --> 02:13:00,140
as governance layers, and some kind of a hollowing out

1990
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:01,780
of the national level.

1991
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:04,340
So in the words of new Breneary talks

1992
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:07,220
about globalization, as the undoing of the state,

1993
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:09,700
will that be because the re-spatialization

1994
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:12,460
or re-territory realization of the state,

1995
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:15,020
where it attaches itself to new spatial layers.

1996
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:18,300
And it calls these new state spaces

1997
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:22,300
to which you have new kinds of new state projects.

1998
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:23,100
The road project.

1999
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:27,060
So to summarize that seems a bit complex,

2000
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:31,180
but there's a shift in how national economies are

2001
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:34,180
being managed in terms of spatial scales.

2002
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:36,620
It's also happening a much more entrepreneurial way.

2003
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:40,620
And I'll say more about that next week.

2004
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:44,140
But the point is that these are politically negotiated

2005
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:50,140
process. And you can have a look at this overview slides to the kind of detailed

2006
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:56,940
process that are going on there. But just to give one example, they also kind of gave last week

2007
02:13:56,940 --> 02:14:03,500
Brussels, it's kind of in this straight jacket of the Brussels capital region, where it doesn't

2008
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:11,340
refer to the spatial scale of the actual netfalls in area of ordinary economic weight of

2009
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:20,220
of the city, whereas in other contexts you see the formation of the larger metropolitan areas

2010
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:28,380
as governance structures, where global city front foot is now a fresh line line, which

2011
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:34,540
have kind of worked in a global city region, organization, which has its own governance

2012
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:42,220
structure etc. So there it's easier to appreciate that emeritus when you compare that to

2013
02:14:42,220 --> 02:14:48,660
So it's a rescaling process and you see that in a lot of Europe being contacted not

2014
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:55,360
seldomly also kind of pushed for by the European Union, who likes to see the Europe of

2015
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:56,360
regions.

2016
02:14:56,360 --> 02:15:04,540
It's kind of this idea that you need larger entities, city regions or regions, to kind

2017
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:08,860
of take control over up to scale economic processes.

2018
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:12,500
So, yeah, a sensitivity to how the state,

2019
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:15,300
especially reorganize itself to all extent,

2020
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:17,860
there's new governance layers to manage

2021
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:19,820
also these economic processes.

2022
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:22,540
That was kind of also added to the state.

2023
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:25,460
And then finally, very final slides,

2024
02:15:25,460 --> 02:15:29,260
is this kind of a critique or a criticism

2025
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:34,100
by people working in the realm of financialization.

2026
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:37,620
I'll say much more about that,

2027
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:40,260
if you take the economic and financial geography course,

2028
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:43,260
it's all about financialization.

2029
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:45,060
But just the point of the fact that

2030
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:50,100
this criticism deals with what it is

2031
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,940
that is going on in world cities.

2032
02:15:52,940 --> 02:15:57,020
So it doesn't really criticize the relevance

2033
02:15:57,020 --> 02:16:01,540
of command and control practices in world and global cities.

2034
02:16:01,540 --> 02:16:03,340
But it says that perhaps the nature

2035
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:05,660
of these activities has transformed

2036
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:09,440
to the past 20 or 30 years.

2037
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:12,240
So financialization, what does it mean?

2038
02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:17,520
It means that an increasing part of economic processes

2039
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:20,960
or value-based processes of profits generally

2040
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:23,000
versus well occurring, you could say,

2041
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
reproductive activities, but is somehow

2042
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,960
connected to financial service.

2043
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:31,800
So financial investments is by owning financial assets

2044
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:36,800
rather than actually produce something that people get rich

2045
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:40,500
and also explains a real way in the qualities

2046
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:44,200
between those who have large huge amounts of wealth

2047
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:46,480
and others who rely on their nature

2048
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:50,000
but we'll say something about that next week.

2049
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,480
So financialization also means that there's a lot

2050
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:58,480
of pressure on corporations to generate returns

2051
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:00,880
for financial investors.

2052
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:03,600
So it's not just about competing with other capitalists

2053
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:06,480
to be the most efficient drug producer

2054
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:08,520
or cooking manufacturers.

2055
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:12,520
It's also to do so, to generate as much shareholder value

2056
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:14,960
compared to your competitors.

2057
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:17,640
It's one, I mean, this kind of quote,

2058
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:18,880
corporate financialization.

2059
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:21,120
It's the restructuring of corporations

2060
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:24,880
so that the shareholder value is actually being created.

2061
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:28,840
So perhaps world cities are still

2062
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:32,920
about seamless service for globalization,

2063
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:35,180
so the management of global production process

2064
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:36,360
is networked.

2065
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:39,000
But this other side, financial markets, perhaps,

2066
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,160
needs to be taken much more seriously.

2067
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:44,440
And these ABS firms may be more in broad and broad

2068
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:49,040
in broad process of finalization, rather than productive

2069
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:49,960
as logics.

2070
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:53,680
So yeah, just--

2071
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:59,680
So yeah, I think what I say here,

2072
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:03,680
we also need to become a obligatory message for other reasons

2073
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:06,680
than the ones that have been assumed already.

2074
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:10,680
And that's why in one paper we talk about an augmented

2075
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:15,680
world city hypothesis is not just about generating value

2076
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:19,680
from productive activities, but it's also about extracting

2077
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:26,080
extracting value to rent extraction practices from those global production networks.

2078
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:31,720
And you can see that, for instance, when we have corporations attract funding, you need

2079
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:40,080
a whole amalgamation of connected ABS firms to issue, in this case, a Euroball, which

2080
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:44,200
is not kind of an offshore investment instrument.

2081
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:48,640
And this is a firm, a real-state corporation,

2082
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:54,160
out of Northern Germany, and kind of pays all these people

2083
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:57,200
to issue that on a global scale.

2084
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:01,160
So to finance its real estate projects in Germany.

2085
02:19:01,160 --> 02:19:04,960
So, well, cities are mobilized to attract funding

2086
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:08,240
and to optimize that in a particular way.

2087
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:11,040
The same thing happens when you look at the other side

2088
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:17,600
equation when value has been produced, the point is that you limit the

2089
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:24,240
taxes that you have to pay on your service value. Otherwise, shareholders are

2090
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:27,960
in the police and you're competing with other firms to pay as much share

2091
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:33,400
other value as possible. This is a classic example by Google who is using

2092
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:44,400
Don't Dutch, Irish, sandwich to make sure that it minimizes its taxes, right?

2093
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:48,400
So it puts, I mean, I say it's a bit as an accident, I don't know, then by the way,

2094
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:54,400
but it places some intellectual property in an environment that surrounds it through the Netherlands,

2095
02:19:54,400 --> 02:20:01,400
towards the back of Ireland, and then it passes through the Caribbean to optimize that structure.

2096
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:06,360
It's also something that firms like Deloitte and law firms are also engaged.

2097
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:11,100
So it's the optimization of these kind of financial structures and

2098
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:16,320
materialization is also a very important function of world city.

2099
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:19,920
So in the end, I think to summarize the picture,

2100
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:24,000
it's about, I can say, representation.

2101
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:32,000
You can think about world cities as kind of Mount Everest's aggloperations of wealth.

2102
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:37,520
That has been generated among the little down below across the territory.

2103
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:46,680
But you can also think about how to call an English-dumerion gas 11 kilometers deep.

2104
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:51,880
Where a value that is being produced elsewhere is being extracted to.

2105
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:58,400
is basically putting a drain on the global economy.

2106
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:02,440
And if you look at what happened during the financial crisis,

2107
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:05,880
the financial sector created a whole surplus.

2108
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:08,240
If you will generate a lot of profits,

2109
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,560
then came the crisis.

2110
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:15,200
And I mean, I think in Europe it was the figure of $700 billion

2111
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:17,640
that financial sector was kind of bailed out.

2112
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:19,880
It was even more in the US.

2113
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:24,680
So it's a huge figure of saving these kind of activities,

2114
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:28,080
where in general they actually put in that drain

2115
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:30,120
on the floor when they come.

2116
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:32,960
So we really have to think about world cities

2117
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:36,320
in a critical way, what do they contribute,

2118
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:37,880
or what are the actors in world cities,

2119
02:21:37,880 --> 02:21:40,720
what do they contribute, and what kind of things

2120
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:43,840
effects are more problematic.

2121
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:46,800
I'm very sorry to take a little bit more of your time,

2122
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:51,800
But that was kind of four ways of being critical about world and global cities.

2123
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:57,800
There's no time for Q&A now, but next week we'll continue.

2124
02:21:57,800 --> 02:22:03,800
I mean, we can start with some questions next week if you'd have them.

2125
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:08,800
And we'll go to the flip side to the point.

2126
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:10,800
About flip side of the coin is just polarization.

2127
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:15,800
So what does it mean world and global city formation for these very places?

2128
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:22,800
And these are the two texts that you're worried and fighting to reach.

2129
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:25,800
Thank you.

2130
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:28,800
