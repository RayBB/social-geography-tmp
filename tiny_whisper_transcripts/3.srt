00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
[Music]

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,840
Okay, well, everybody, third session, urban social geography.

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,680
This week's topic is polarization, rural and global cities.

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
Now, just a few housekeeping announcements.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,840
I think in the meantime, everybody has seen schedules regarding discussion seminars.

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,640
I think there's still some minor issues here and there.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,400
We'll try to get that sorted as soon as possible, but make sure next week there will be

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,600
a discussion similar to each one of you. So please attend and if you're there to present

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,000
take the guidelines which has five to six to ten minutes of presentation because it will be a

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,640
tight exercise in any case. So I have to practice a little bit at home so that you stay within

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,040
those ten minutes as much as possible and then we'll have a nice discussion.

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,720
also be advised that we started excursions this Friday on start in Brussels for those

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:31,200
urban in urban studies who are joining the global city Brussels excursion and as a reminder we need at

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:41,200
them at the north station Brussels north and we need at plus similar bolifier which is the main

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,780
square at the side of the World Trade Center looking towards the canal. So

16
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,760
Simon Bolivad and you'll see if you're early either me wearing a very special

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,680
hat perhaps and some roses and then if you're late you'll see a whole bunch of

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,280
people so you can't really miss us. In any case you will be down the stairs

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,120
and somewhere on the square there's a few benches there. We will probably

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,280
We end around five at latest in European quarter.

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,520
And yeah, you can bring lunch,

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,240
but you can also buy lunch somewhere

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,280
that will be time over at lunch time

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,720
to actually buy lunch wherever you want to.

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,440
So that's not necessary.

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,040
I have no idea whether it will be the police,

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,000
check the weather forecast and just accordingly.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,920
And as I've learned, the pencil works better than a pen.

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,920
It's kind of a weather proof, although I hope it's not a tornado that's going to hit Brussels.

30
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Okay.

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Right.

32
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:56,920
So last week we've been talking about, you could say how to understand the role of cities in the global economy,

33
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:06,920
whole discussion about command and control functions, to what extends power in this global urban system relates to either headquarters

34
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,920
workers and the more classic world cities definition or are the first to say this amalgamation

35
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:23,080
or complex of advanced producer services who collectively produce control capabilities

36
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,840
over global production networks, global financial markets and also discuss plenty of critiques,

37
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,960
different forms of critique on those startups.

38
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:40,820
What we'll try to do today is turn the coin around and kind of in the spirit of John

39
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,740
Friedman's work back to the 80s, if you will, is also try to reflect on what extent

40
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,580
the insertion in these global urban systems, these powerful roles in the global economy,

41
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,380
also affects the internal structure of cities.

42
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,380
So it's kind of this macro, micro link.

43
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,700
We went from, oh my god, the economy is globalizing.

44
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,020
What does this tell us about the changing role of cities

45
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,620
in that global economy?

46
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,100
Now having established that centrality in the global economy,

47
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,380
now we wonder to what extent there are effects or implications

48
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,460
of that insertion on the social structure of cities.

49
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,780
So it's kind of the flip side of last week's talk.

50
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,420
So just to get started a little bit, some maps.

51
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,660
Was there a question?

52
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,060
- I'm like, what,

53
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,140
I could be honest, I could be honest.

54
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,660
If I can do that, everyone agrees

55
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,860
because we don't break it.

56
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,140
You know, it's a must.

57
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,980
- Yes.

58
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,820
- It's a must.

59
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,660
- Straight forward.

60
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,580
- I understand, yes, it was a bit back.

61
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,700
So let's try to have a break somewhere

62
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,780
at six, something or five,

63
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,220
but I'll six, yeah, sure.

64
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,060
No problem.

65
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,860
Yeah, some maps.

66
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,940
I will, yes.

67
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:07,420
The live stream isn't working.

68
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,500
Okay.

69
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,340
Or rather not okay.

70
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:23,740
It is recording.

71
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:33,160
Now as you can see there's a red button there and I think the audio is supposed to work.

72
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,820
Zero viewers okay that gives us a hint.

73
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,460
Let's see.

74
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,460
wrong link. Okay, let's see.

75
00:05:51,460 --> 00:06:07,580
All right, let me just put this online.

76
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,580
(audience chattering)

77
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:39,580
[ Background Sounds ]

78
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:46,580
It looks awfully the same.

79
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,580
Doesn't it?

80
00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:19,580
[inaudible]

81
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:26,300
There's already one viewer. So that means it works. Yeah, I think we're there.

82
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:34,620
Is it okay? Yeah. All right, then.

83
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:46,300
Okay, I could just try to start again. I started so maths always nice.

84
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:54,620
Please unmaps from the study of the talk a little bit more about in a second from the opportunity

85
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:03,500
at last in the US. Basically shows you the median household income of residents over a certain period.

86
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:10,700
So this is Chicago, the darker, I mean the the bluer, the richer if you will, the higher the income

87
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,060
And the more the U.S. is red, it's lowering.

88
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:21,060
So what I've kind of seen is very much kind of concentrated wealth in the city center,

89
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,100
apparently of Chicago.

90
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,980
And then the peripheries, these kind of other rings of Chicago,

91
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,420
with lower incomes, and then going back further from the center,

92
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:39,220
richer neighborhoods, kind of the opposite picture here

93
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,820
In Detroit, I'll show some examples from the US because this is great material in that.

94
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:53,060
Here we see a very large concentration of the poverty or lower incomes in the city center,

95
00:08:53,060 --> 00:09:00,420
or it's actually the city of Detroit, which interestingly ends at this kind of road here.

96
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:09,220
a tomorrow road which you may know if you still know who Eminem is. He's been talking about this.

97
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:15,540
The old born and raised somewhere over there. It acts as kind of a city limit.

98
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,380
You could say the inner city neighborhood and also kind of a fiscal limit.

99
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:29,220
At this point we see that actually it's a quite strong social spatial divide between

100
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,660
or neighborhoods in the city center and then richer. Subverts, you may know that Detroit has

101
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:44,820
gone into default a few years ago, so it's kind of a weird situation because it is a rich

102
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,060
agglomeration, if you will, but the city itself, which kind of ends at the 8 mile road,

103
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,940
is quite poor. So there's a lot of people commuting into the city that quite rich,

104
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,380
but the physical base of the city itself is kind of it's kind of limited. Okay. So quite a

105
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:15,620
large rupture there in space. Other examples are Los Angeles, a lot of inner city poverty and very

106
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:24,460
which suburbs, if you will, we all know Beverly Hills and those kind of areas.

107
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:33,240
This is Miami, just another example, from a stark contrast at the neighborhood level between

108
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,320
It's a north Miami and south Miami.

109
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,000
No, so quite a stark difference between,

110
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
say Miami Beach, where the tourist areas are.

111
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,200
And the continent, if you will,

112
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,400
what is kind of interesting in the case of Miami

113
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,840
is that actually from a climatological

114
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,160
environmental perspective,

115
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,560
that's actually quite safe to live all short.

116
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,240
And these are kind of the foreign neighborhoods

117
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,800
with kind of increased strength of floods

118
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,080
and those kind of things.

119
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,280
We see some kind of a movement back onshore also

120
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,880
by richer people.

121
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,600
Some people call this climate related gentrification.

122
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,880
We start seeing an appreciation of real estate values

123
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,800
onshore.

124
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,040
So it kind of shows that environmental impacts

125
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,640
also kind of start impacting social spatial divisions.

126
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Another example of Nua Linz, as you may know,

127
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:44,640
from more than a decade ago, it was hit by a large hurricane,

128
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,640
and also had a very differentiated effect in racialized and ethnic terms.

129
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,640
A lot of people were hit, were left without help.

130
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
A lot of people residing in these foreign neighborhoods

131
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,640
also has a different kind of ethnic background.

132
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,640
So again, quite a bit of conditions there.

133
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:12,640
San Francisco looks pretty well gentrified,

134
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,640
also kind of very common sensical.

135
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,640
I mean, you look at real estate price in the wider San Francisco Bay area.

136
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,640
And it's obviously also related to this kind of happiness

137
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:34,960
or global city regionism that is going on there, but just still a few pockets of the

138
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,440
public for instance, China town there to the north, perhaps also the mission which is a kind of

139
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,520
which the mother neighborhood, yes.

140
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,000
- Because in the city that there's a piece right there,

141
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,360
they can have a key room that will

142
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,360
get up, that can be normalized towards the specific.

143
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,040
- You know what I mean about that?

144
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,560
- No, I think it's, if you look at the scale,

145
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,200
it's the same everywhere, right?

146
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,960
So you can compare across cities as well.

147
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,680
It's a good point, it could mean that we kind of lose

148
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,160
some of the nuance in certain places.

149
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,400
But what you gain is comparability across cities.

150
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,920
But I can say a bit more about that in a second.

151
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,920
New York, a city that we'll be talking more about,

152
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,320
very kind of rich, lower-man-hand,

153
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,200
who worked at the north, I feel a bit like a weatherman here.

154
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,280
You're into the north.

155
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,120
It's, as we know, a bit more cloudy.

156
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,480
No, I mean, it's an area with lower incomes, the Bronx.

157
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,080
Interesting area is also here, Brooklyn,

158
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,800
which we'll be talking about a bit later,

159
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,880
which kind of follows the income characteristics

160
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,640
of Manhattan.

161
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,760
There's a kind of still lowerness.

162
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,240
And we have a little Italy, and there's

163
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,720
kind of places where still, you could say,

164
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
giving some shelter to people that are not crazy rich.

165
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,720
But you could say a lot of concentrated wealth in the center,

166
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,720
then a whole kind of area with a poorer population,

167
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,720
and then you could say the rich kind of suburbs begin again.

168
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Now the point is not necessarily today to talk about spatial structures.

169
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,720
You'll talk a way more about that with Nick,

170
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,720
and you'll discuss segregation patterns and those kind of things.

171
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,720
What I want to focus on is mostly you could say the reality of,

172
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,720
you could say, the vision, income divisions, class divisions in cities.

173
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,720
So where do these examples come from?

174
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,720
This is, I think you'll find it the great website.

175
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
It's called the opportunity Atlas.

176
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,720
And what I've actually had intense to do,

177
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,520
that also connects to the work of Nick or that.

178
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,800
Things that Nick will talk about.

179
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,720
It tries to trace, you could say, neighborhood effects.

180
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,400
And the idea is that the neighborhood

181
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,640
that you raise them will have a substantial role

182
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,320
in your future life chances.

183
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,920
And they're basically, but you can read more about it

184
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,320
on this webpage.

185
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,880
They basically tracked the evolution of people

186
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,700
kind of life development or careers of people linking it back to their original

187
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,360
neighborhood. So to the place they were born. So they could say, okay, people that

188
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,000
report in the Bronx, 16 years later, what is the kind of chance they become

189
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,760
incarcerated, what is their income level, etc. etc. So it's kind of in the way

190
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:57,520
trying to measure some form of spatial privilege, but having resided or

191
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,480
being born in certain neighborhoods that will have actually an effect which is in some way

192
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,080
you could say reducible to the amenities that you have to the social context that you have.

193
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,240
But perhaps there's also even more than that maybe some kind of isolated spatial effect

194
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
beyond.

195
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,920
But that's kind of the wider context of this up-loss and I think, yeah, it's, I would have

196
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,320
hoped that we had this for Europe.

197
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,880
It's a great resource and you can browse a bit to that.

198
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,180
So what I just want to focus on today is the fact, or use as exhibits, are these income

199
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,560
maps to illustrate that polarization in terms of income is a day to day reality in a lot

200
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,200
of US metropolises.

201
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,400
Had we had the data in Europe, we would also find quite stark contrast, perhaps a little

202
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,400
bit less, but still, it would also be there.

203
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:00,660
So what we can discuss then today I think is to what extent clause divisions are reproduced

204
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:08,260
in and through space and actually try to understand why such divisions occur in cities

205
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,260
in the first place.

206
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,620
Now this is a very big debate obviously.

207
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:17,400
What we'll try to do is try to link that to the debate we have last week and try to

208
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,440
linked to what extends global and relatively functions add to existing polarization because

209
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:32,600
we cannot reduce it to an effect of having headquarters or something, but perhaps entering

210
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,000
the discussion through globalized urbanization, we could actually start unpacking some of this.

211
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,800
So, glass divisions are about the fact that we see social spatial structures on the basis of

212
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,600
social groupings of income, profession, occupational structure and those that.

213
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,320
So looking through income levels and occupation, we find a social

214
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,960
especially diverse structure. Now I use class here in a very, let's say,

215
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,400
analytical naive way because if you use class, in many cases, authors would also refer to

216
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:22,120
some form of identity formation linked to that. That's not what I do here. It's more of a much more

217
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:29,720
mundane looking at income levels to look at the change extractor of the city. There's big debates

218
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:36,520
to what extent there is still such thing as class identity. It has something to do with

219
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,760
existence of subcultures, depolitization, etc. That's not really the point here. It would be

220
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,680
interesting debate, it's more about can we see objective, objective,

221
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:53,640
viable divisions there in society based on income and occupation, okay, just to clear that

222
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:02,600
moment. All right, so polarization, it has been on the agenda, it has been one of the main

223
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:09,960
source of impetus or starting point for the world in global cities debate. And again, going

224
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,800
back to John Friedman and Sir Wolf in 1982. It's what kind of initiated their

225
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,000
interests there. So just to allow me to recite with its towers of stealing glass

226
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,840
and its scientific shopping malls, the Citadel is the city's most vulnerable

227
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,880
symbol. Its smooth surfaces suggest a sleek and personality of money power. Its

228
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,720
Its interior spaces are ample elegant and plush.

229
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
In a properly secluded space is the transnational elites

230
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,800
who have built their residences and playgrounds.

231
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,520
Country clubs and bridal paths and private beaches.

232
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,560
The overcrowded ghettos exist in the far shadows of the citadel

233
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,160
where it is further divided into racial and ethnic enclaves.

234
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,000
Some areas are shanty towns.

235
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,280
Not well provided with public services,

236
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,640
garbage is that does not get collected.

237
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,440
only the police in the squad cars visible in evidence.

238
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,760
In many places, get to residence or allowed outside

239
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,960
to zones only during working hours.

240
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,280
Their appearance in the Citadel After Dark creates a small panic.

241
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,160
So it's kind of a very dystopian image.

242
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,240
You can say it's exaggerated.

243
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,600
It's kind of not exactly empowering.

244
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
It's also very black-white.

245
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
But it's something with this opposition

246
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,760
that they try to work with some kind of growing divide

247
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,040
and cities that is going to become a social problem.

248
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,000
And that's also what you also read in the world

249
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,880
city hypothesis of self-self-free crime.

250
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,440
It's at some point it will become everybody's problem

251
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,680
and probably also the problem of the elite.

252
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,080
Now again, this kind of description,

253
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,440
tries to capture particular reality.

254
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Last week, I think I mentioned Robert De Niro and taxi driver.

255
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
Perhaps John Friedman was talking more,

256
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,800
talking about contemporary LA,

257
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,440
which is kind of marked by this citadel form

258
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,480
that we have left if you have been to LA.

259
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,120
I mean, a lot of elites or people that are walking around here

260
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,040
never touch ground.

261
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,280
They hover around, they never go on the ground floor,

262
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,400
but it's kind of a problem to jump by taxi

263
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,040
and one of the hotels and then they go

264
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,760
at the first floor level,

265
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,200
or second floor level in the US,

266
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,880
from one building to another.

267
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,920
So it's not only kind of horizontally segregated,

268
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,560
there's also kind of vertical segregation there

269
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,200
so this kind of this flow of people

270
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,200
is not mixed with buses by.

271
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,000
Then a bit further, just kind of two, three, four,

272
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,520
It is both streets LA not to be confused with Wall Street in New York and this is kind of where

273
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,760
a completely different kind of neighborhood start. So as you remember this map from LA,

274
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:18,680
in general you could say a very poor inner city neighborhood but kind of imprinted by a number of

275
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:28,520
hotels which kind of breathe post-modern feelings and sentiments, but then very close to that

276
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:36,280
immediately you kind of struck with rapid decline. Some people would call this the zone of transition

277
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,600
and we'll be talking with Nick about the Bergus model of cities. There's a kind of a place that

278
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,040
that isn't changed. It's kind of changing functions. It's also a place where a lot of

279
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:55,000
migrants arrive. There's a lot of informal economy, etc. And there's also kind of an idea

280
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,360
even in contemporary LA that these places, the citadel, if you will, these hotels are also places

281
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,560
that should not be frequented by people that have nothing to do there. And just, yeah, as I walk by,

282
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:16,360
I think it was a doorstep of a plaza of a bank of America or something that I took it.

283
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Yeah, bank tower at 53. And it's kind of regulating social space there.

284
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,760
And yeah, you can't really read it now, but maybe you should read it at home.

285
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,200
This kind of very ambiguous language being used. So any activities that are

286
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,320
has a phrase again that may be annoyance or uses,

287
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,280
that are already annoying people or could annoy people,

288
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,120
or actually not allow them there.

289
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,280
So it's a very, you could say,

290
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,360
a vigorous fake description,

291
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,640
which gives, for instance, social security guards

292
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,880
the liberty to actually remove people from public space,

293
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:07,480
people that are homeless and there's a huge homelessness issue. In LA, people are being displaced,

294
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,000
even if they put their tents in downtown. There's a little pan-handling selling stuff and those kind

295
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,680
of things and that is kind of policed away. So it's not, it's to be removed from that public space

296
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,120
because it doesn't fit the kind of perhaps expectations of people that that's frequent these

297
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:35,160
more like citadel structures. So we can say it could be an extreme example but still very much

298
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:43,160
relevant today, 30 or 40 years after Children's Treatment was started out. This is, say, one of the

299
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:52,120
leading matropolises and economic terms of the world. So if it's happening here, we could

300
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,680
imagine it's also happening elsewhere. Now what I would try to do now is look a little bit into

301
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:07,960
exhibits about this archetypical case if you will, New York City. To show you a bit more

302
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:17,720
how polarization patterns have evolved over the past decades. I mean it's a Greek drama, you know

303
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:25,800
already what is happening and the answer is polarization has increased. So income disparities

304
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:33,080
between different kind of income groups in society has increased. And why in New York? Well, I mean,

305
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,800
it's one of the, say, has been one of the city's world cities that has, has received a lot of

306
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,760
attention. It's still one of the main financial centers of the world. It's kind of an extreme case,

307
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:53,880
if you will, if you try to research the impact of these kind of activities on the urban fabric.

308
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:01,920
So, I'm referring here to a very nice study by the fiscal policy institute.

309
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,560
It's a bit dated, but I still love it.

310
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,600
I'm actually hoping that it will do the exercise again quite soon.

311
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:16,120
The previous one, report was just before the crisis, this one is kind of diagnosing what

312
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,000
when done just after the crisis and I hope they have some kind of I don't know

313
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,600
a bit of COVID kind of report sometimes soon but they mostly look in these studies at the

314
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,760
evolution of income distribution and they use all kind of weird terms such as these

315
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:43,240
styles, quintiles, quartiles which refers to the place of an income group any entire

316
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,240
So a quintile is actually a fifth of the entire distribution.

317
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,240
So top quintile would be the top 20% of earners and their average income.

318
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:02,240
The bottom quintile would be the average of the lowest 20% of incomes.

319
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,240
So these are relative terms that show the position with a certain income.

320
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,240
What you would take position you would take in this distribution.

321
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,240
And it's usually focusing on income, which is income

322
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,200
out of labor in one way or in order.

323
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,240
Okay.

324
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,160
So this is just one comparison.

325
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,120
And what they also do is,

326
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,720
and they try to compare New York City quite often.

327
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,040
Sometimes they don't have data on New York City itself,

328
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,080
and then they use New York State,

329
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,280
but try to be as specific as possible.

330
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,120
And then they also try to compare to United States.

331
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
That's a question.

332
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,120
[inaudible]

333
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Yeah.

334
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,120
[inaudible]

335
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,120
[inaudible]

336
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,120
[inaudible]

337
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Yeah. I think, I mean, large would be polarization,

338
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,120
but the point is indeed, and that's kind of something that we get to later,

339
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,960
is that the question is, obviously,

340
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,120
more easily start looking at income,

341
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,520
because these kinds of data are,

342
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,880
it is defined.

343
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,920
The next question is what's the underlying occupational structure,

344
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,120
so what produces that reality?

345
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,360
And there's something that we'll pick up on later,

346
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,680
and obviously connected quite often,

347
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,920
kind of you could think about,

348
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,400
shift towards high-end service jobs,

349
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,040
what generates higher incomes?

350
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,120
But the connection is not always there,

351
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,680
it's always highly contextual,

352
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,840
the same kind of occupations,

353
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,280
in different contexts may give a very different income level

354
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,920
and that can be for a lot of reasons.

355
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,520
So yeah, but here we're talking about income polarization

356
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,920
to be sure because it's the most obvious here and now.

357
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,960
So yeah, as I said, they tried to compare

358
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,280
give me your work, sometimes they use in the New York state, etc. So what you see is here,

359
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:21,040
the median family income, so this kind of people that are just in the middle of this distribution,

360
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:28,880
this has been declining over the past, I think 10, I mean, in this case it's kind of three,

361
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:36,000
four years after the great recession, right? So we see that 2008, it has 9, 2010, 2011,

362
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,760
you find the steep decline and it's actually more pronounced in the city of New York.

363
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,520
So the city of New York on average, the median income was already much lower than compared to

364
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,640
New York state which is kind of more affairs to the broader agglomeration mostly but then also the

365
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:02,080
rest of the state and it was also significantly lower at a magazine. So in general, there's a decline

366
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:09,840
and median income in the city of New York. At the same time what we see at the other kind of

367
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:19,600
side of the picture is the share of income, total income, going to the top 1%. And here is again a

368
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:28,880
comparison between US in red, then the state of New York in green and then New York city kind of

369
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,040
small scale in blue, which is on top line. So it's kind of interesting to see and this

370
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,360
data goes back to the 1980s. They'll share very similar patterns there at the beginning.

371
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:48,320
The share of income going to the top 1%, that's just reminds yourself 1% of the entire distribution

372
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:58,480
that the top 1% against the 99 remember was about 12% or 3% in the 1980s. This has exploded right.

373
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:08,320
So it has grown across all scales to something modest off, you could say 22% in the US.

374
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:15,440
So 1% owns 22% of all income, just reflect on that.

375
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:25,680
And then in New York, we see that almost 45, almost half of all income is owned by the top 1%.

376
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:32,000
Okay, so we all know Jeff Bezos and others, but this is kind of way more systematic. Yes

377
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:50,600
Yeah, but the previous one yeah, that's true. I mean this is just a figure

378
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:58,600
And it's one of the perfect options that you can take.

379
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Yeah, this too.

380
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
That's right.

381
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:07,600
This is kind of, you could say, the median income has decreased everywhere.

382
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
It does seem to find here.

383
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,600
I would say that it decreases more in New York City compared to others.

384
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,440
less you would have to look at percent just there for New York State of the US.

385
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,240
But I think it's kind of going from 59 to 54. Yeah, that's a very significantly

386
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,800
client. But it's not one online comparable, you're right. So this goes back way more in time.

387
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:41,600
But the main point being here is that a very small percentage is actually running away with a

388
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:49,520
lot of income and again in the CFA, there was connection to what you were asking. There was a decline

389
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:58,400
in general also for these top 1% with the global financial crisis but you also see that it's kind

390
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:05,120
of very quick rebound of these highest incomes, right? So they kind of take a hit and it has

391
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,480
something to do probably with their, like they're exposed to so much parts of the economy,

392
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:20,480
but then they rebans quite soon. Okay. Another kind of graph here comparing New York state to the US,

393
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:28,320
so unfortunately not at the city level, but yeah, you get an idea. Here it's comparing a top 5%

394
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:36,720
in terms of income and total income, which you could say the bottom quintile, so the 20%

395
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,920
lowest incomes, and then the middle group, right? So from 40 to 60%, but in the distribution.

396
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:52,240
So what you find is that over the years, and this is comparing the late 70s,

397
00:33:52,800 --> 00:34:00,480
to say the mid 2000s. I mean it's a dated analysis but that's the furthest that they could go in

398
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:12,320
this analysis. In the 1970s the ratio between the top 5% and the lowest incomes was 7.4. So people

399
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,200
in the top 5 earn 7.4 times more than people with the lowest incomes and the lowest quintile

400
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,040
By the mid 2000s it had become 17.3 times.

401
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:33,120
So take the income of the lowest income households times 17.3.

402
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,480
So tremendous tremendously growing difference.

403
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,600
And it's also when you prepare to get a right growing much faster than what you see in US in general.

404
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,600
And it still also pertains to the relation between the top 5% and you,

405
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,680
but you could say the middle income group or the middle class,

406
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,520
even there are kind of these disparities have doubled and they have increased more

407
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:08,880
when you compare it to the US. So it went from 2.9 to 5.3 compared to 4.7 when compared to US.

408
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,120
Okay, so massively increasing that difference.

409
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,920
So it means that there's a growing concentration of income in a very small group.

410
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,680
Another exhibit showing this is comparing the growth in income between different groups.

411
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,600
So the bottom quintile again, lowest incomes actually lost a share in total income.

412
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,240
When you compare the late 90s to the mid 2000s,

413
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,440
there was some growth for middle income groups

414
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,080
and it was a very large group,

415
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,080
but growth of 18 to 19% can come off the line.

416
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,880
And so the trends are kind of clear.

417
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,480
There was a slow hiccup with the global financial crisis,

418
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,440
but it's kind of a secular trend

419
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,360
where a very small percentage of the population,

420
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:11,440
it 1% or 5% is gaining more and more share in the total distribution of ink.

421
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,120
One way of looking at that is why that could be and we'll talk about general patterns

422
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:27,440
also more towards the end of today's session is looking at what happens in evolutions of productivity.

423
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,220
So with one hour of work, what kind of value do you produce?

424
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,920
How much cookies do you cut or how much hard do you make?

425
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,800
Or how much, let's say, transactions, financial transactions.

426
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,080
Can you conclude?

427
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,160
Versus the income from those activities.

428
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:56,720
So what you see is that from 2001 until 2011 here,

429
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,200
There's actually a 14% increase in productivity.

430
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,840
So for the same hour of work,

431
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,680
you produce 14% more wealth, if you will.

432
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,120
But when you look at the income levels from labor

433
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,400
and you will average real wage,

434
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,760
so these are the salaries that people get.

435
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,960
It has increased a little bit,

436
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,200
but it has by no means kept base with the rises

437
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,440
and productivity levels.

438
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,340
Okay, so it's kind of, it's running away.

439
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,400
So there's an increase of about,

440
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,880
what is it here, two, three, four percent?

441
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,600
As we go across those 10 years.

442
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,440
So that means that something else is probably happening

443
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,440
with the weld and value that's being created.

444
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,680
And we talked a little bit about financialization last week.

445
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,200
It means that it's, if it's not going to labor,

446
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,080
it's probably going to the factor of capital,

447
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:03,240
which means shareholders or you could say well-remunerated employees such as CEOs, managers

448
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,120
who actually take a growing piece of the cake.

449
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,120
What do you want to do with this?

450
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
Can you talk about this?

451
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,960
Yeah, this is New York.

452
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:22,520
Well, get to more global patterns more towards the end as a kind of an outlook exercise.

453
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,560
But it's a trend that is occurring across countries, right?

454
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,800
And there's probably no the work of Thomas Piketty.

455
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,840
It may have run a bell already.

456
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:40,480
He and his group of, I can say, economic historians have looked

457
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,160
at systematically at income data and income distribution data

458
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,000
in a more long-term perspective.

459
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,520
And they can't compare all countries

460
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,420
because their data sources are limited,

461
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,220
but they require a number of key European countries,

462
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,760
US, UK, Australia, et cetera, et cetera.

463
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,020
So yeah, these are unfortunately

464
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,800
patterns we see everywhere,

465
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,800
but in some contexts they're more extreme than elsewhere.

466
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,120
And US, UK, and we'll get to that at some point

467
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,400
are the most extreme cases here.

468
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,200
So yeah, runaway productivity, but not necessarily

469
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,600
more remuneration.

470
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,360
On the other side is--

471
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:34,640
and I think a very telling graph is, to what extent

472
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,120
can you make a living, a decent living,

473
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,960
if you work full time, all the minimum wage?

474
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,600
This was the analysis.

475
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,720
And I go back again to the 1980s, is it right?

476
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Yeah, or even earlier, and you see that you're in a substantial period of time.

477
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,720
If you were at a minimum wage, you were well above the poverty line, right?

478
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:07,720
So you had like 120% so you could live here well decently and you wouldn't live in poverty.

479
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
And this has completely melted away.

480
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,720
So it became very bad in the kind of 1990s, but even well in today,

481
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,640
You see that even if you work full-time at this weight,

482
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,520
you still fall below the poverty line.

483
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,120
So it's kind of something institutionally is wrong there.

484
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,000
And the fiscal policy institute has been one of the main advocates

485
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,200
also for an increase in minimum wages.

486
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:41,080
And yeah, and a lot of metropolitan areas also, for instance, in London.

487
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:49,080
There's also kind of the month for a long living wage, which sometimes should be higher

488
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,920
than in the rest of the country because this kind of the living, it's just more expensive

489
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,160
in these large metropolitan areas. So a very dire picture, a lot of people at the very bottom

490
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,040
are not only, you could say, you could say, losing out in terms of income levels,

491
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:14,040
It's also still it's not sufficient to actually make to nothing when you're at that side of the income distribution.

492
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:21,320
So just to give you a bit of a picture from this RUB extreme case of the the sincerity of the situation.

493
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:29,880
And yeah you can find this report online pulling apart in New York and I would recommend that you

494
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,880
have looked at that. I think the conclusion is that we see in growing income

495
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,320
polarization in the state of New York, more narrowly in New York City, and it's

496
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:48,440
becoming more dramatic than the US average. Okay, over to you for another one

that specifically world-in global cities are becoming so

Okay, let's hear it.

507
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,340
It's when you came up with.

508
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:10,340
What did you come up with?

509
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,340
Yeah.

510
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:27,340
So there's a comment about the cost of living.

511
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:38,340
The correct, but it's more, you can say more a symptom, if you will, I mean, it's kind of the price of real estate, housing, daily consumption, etc.

512
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:45,340
You can say it affects everybody to similar degree unless we acknowledge that there's even more differences.

513
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:51,340
I mean, that's because of living for the rich would be also very high, but maybe they can afford it.

514
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,340
It's not really an explanation of why we see polarization at stake.

515
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:02,340
I think other governments are into the trickle-down effects of the regulatory development.

516
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:09,340
So we see large companies already have a lot of capital, getting more subsidies from the government,

517
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:17,340
getting placed in say special economic zones where electricity land leaves around the government.

518
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,340
A lot of things are subsidized.

519
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,340
Again, I tried to be well-providing employment.

520
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,380
However, that said employment,

521
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,380
the salary is not distributing.

522
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:33,060
So you have the larger company getting larger.

523
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,380
- What do you mean with trickle down, logics?

524
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,220
- Yes.

525
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,380
So, I mean, the right to recover that is, of course,

526
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,820
then if you have a large company,

527
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:53,580
It provides employment and ideas scenario is that more women, people who do it more money,

528
00:45:53,580 --> 00:46:00,080
etc. What often happens is that the job 1% of the job which you will probably get larger

529
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,580
income and the contribution is right here.

530
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:11,580
So yeah, this important critique I think is also what Princess Doreen Massey was talking about,

531
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,860
I mean, and throughout her career, fighting this kind of trickle down economic principle,

532
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:24,060
and she talks about course of global cityization, which is actually producing inequalities,

533
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,860
which are not as much as let's wait for a bit more global city formation,

534
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:35,500
and it will be easy away. What she actually says, no, this polarization is an outcome of

535
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,380
of global city formation, it's because you have certain

536
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,840
activities that you have.

537
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,300
It's not something permanent.

538
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,140
And not something that will go away,

539
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,980
but more trickle down economics.

540
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,980
So because economics is something with,

541
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,020
like that you create multipliers,

542
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,620
that money circulates to the territory,

543
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,700
which then create jobs,

544
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,700
where then fuel growth, et cetera.

545
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,940

of business climate.

561
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:36,180
Well, national policies that are restructuring the detection of labor,

562
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:45,500
I also think that the cities are trying to struggle to attract global companies and that

563
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,500
at the end, global companies, they don't really enrich these budgets with the taxes because

564
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:56,700
they're either evaded, either the city trying to once get a try to build a global company

565
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,700
to try to sell some space.

566
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:05,020
They have in terms of subsidies, but then like taxes, if something supports the overall

567
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:11,580
more like insecure parts of population and then like they are like low income

568
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:18,340
more aggressive and then just support the opportunity. Okay let's there was a

569
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:23,820
little vamp's from there so spatial redistribution yeah. I would just like to add

570
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:30,660
the role of this state in regulation, real in taxation and also being social

571
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,520
So this is something in one of the class,

572
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,360
just mentions it very briefly about the different mental states

573
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,160
of life is like this process that's shaped in states

574
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,240
that have a more active role, and it is something

575
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,840
that also shapes this position.

576
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,400

of comments that are there and just my public.

597
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:52,320
And you say a bit more about social reproduction, because it's a very analytical term or

598
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,320
kind of almost theoretical term, what do you mean with that?

to what extent would it play out more in an urban context

617
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,300
than say, in, you know, rural Britain?

618
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,300
Maybe because it's poverty is less present there,

619
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:28,820
that's present there, although I would like to see map of that. But yeah, I think the

620
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:33,300
power of neoliberal ideas is clearly going to that. Okay, one final idea.

00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:23,300
is still solidarity between people and to what extent the urban environment still supports that.

627
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:37,060

628
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:42,980
Thank you to a number of slides because I think try to gather a number of elements and then work towards this

However, full of all it is will try to try to get there and then we'll take a short break

631
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:59,620
So yeah conceptualization, all of books have been written about this.

632
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:06,620
I've been most of them referring to the global city, but there's plenty of other kind of scholarship on that.

633
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:21,620
As you can see in this picture, it has been one of the main kind of theorized conceptualized problems of contemporary cities and something with what you do with these dualities.

634
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:28,620
Jomonkov and Manuken cells talked about dual cities, Susan feinstein,

635
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:33,180
wrote by the divided cities, Peter Marker is another great scholar talked about

636
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:37,980
water cities, Berger talked about fragmented cities etc.

637
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,180
So it has been one of the main debates in urban social

638
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:47,140
chocolate. But it seems that all these kinds of things

639
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:53,620
necessarily or most emblematically start to connect to cities rather than wider

640
00:55:53,620 --> 00:56:01,960
territories. And a lot of people start to look for particular answers as I said

641
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:07,060
last week I tend to go back to the 80s because it's kind of my my natural

642
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:14,060
cohort but quite often people go back to the 60s the 70s and this kind of wider

643
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:18,900
the restructure of cities and wider economies,

644
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,420
and we could say the North Atlantic sphere.

645
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,620
So it's, I mean, there's a lot of things have been written.

646
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:30,140
There's a rich scholarship, but arguably it's kind of biased,

647
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:34,940
if you will, to the crisis of cities or the crisis cities

648
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:39,100
have underwent in Western Europe, North and America.

649
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,100
So there's plenty of stuff that needs to be

650
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:48,540
written on the histories and these historical trajectories of, say, Chinese cities,

651
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:57,660
African cities, etc, etc. But it's not something that I can now cover today, okay? But

652
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:05,900
it's, yeah, kind of the general narrative that you find in these different kind of analysis

653
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,700
is that the economic restructuring kind of started in the 1960s,

654
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:15,180
when there's a culmination of the crisis of what they call

655
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,140
North Atlantic 4-Dism. And as I think explained last week or two weeks ago,

656
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:27,900
there was this system of regulating capitalism, but there was a deal, say, between the workers

657
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:35,340
and capital that increased productivity, would that the fruits of that and the

658
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,860
the surface of that would be shared with birds.

659
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:42,900
It's kind of forward going back to Henry Ford.

660
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:48,500
He pages workers a little bit more so there would be more productive, but they could actually

661
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,300
in fact also buy the cars that they were producing at the hellish speed.

662
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,580
So that was kind of the wider model.

663
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:02,060
We saw the emergence of the middle classes and the immediate post-war era.

664
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:07,500
could buy consumer goods because of rising productivity levels.

665
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:13,580
It was the invention of free time to actually spend your money and consume it as we actually

666
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,780
go to shop shops and buy stuff.

667
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:21,540
At some point this model kind of started to crumble.

668
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,740
There were problems with productivity.

669
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:34,220
It couldn't keep up with rising wages and kind of at the macro level the solution was a

670
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:41,500
relocation of production and you could say the start point of globalization, new international

671
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,300
division of labor.

672
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:48,100
The effect was that it was the industrialization in, you could say, the core of the

673
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,700
world economy, his high income industrialized places.

674
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,340
So again, we're talking about Northern America,

675
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,700
Western Europe mostly.

676
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:02,980
And it's set in motion to process of structural unemployment,

677
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:07,140
which was felt throughout countries and territories,

678
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,220
but was very, very urban and many contacts.

679
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:16,660
There was a lot of productive activities within cities.

680
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:20,820
And as these activities moved away became obsolete,

681
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,820
What happened is that you could say urban poverty

682
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,900
and an employment became very much urban phenomena.

683
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,020
So cities lost their functions, productive functions,

684
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,340
but they had to do with a lot of,

685
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,020
they could say the costs of an employment, et cetera, et cetera.

686
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,540
So we have a declining tax base

687
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:44,540
and in many contexts what you see is a shift towards austerity.

688
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:50,380
So there's less income, so this budget cuts, et cetera, et cetera.

689
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:56,580
So the whole idea and the immediate post war era was a strong key engine state.

690
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:01,340
So we had mass production, mass consumption, but also a state that was inspired by

691
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:08,420
German and East said, okay, if there's an issue with consumption, well,

692
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,460
the government itself will be of the first investor will make sure that,

693
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,340
that the economy keeps on going.

694
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,900
That kind of changed in this period as well.

695
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,180
The state was seen as something that had to roll back

696
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:27,880
its activities, stop interfering with all kinds of market-based

697
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,140
processes.

698
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:35,900
And so this kind of the starting point of a new liberal ideology,

699
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,700
whereas the state was still kind of setting the rules

700
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,620
of market systems.

701
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:48,620
It stopped indeed providing, for instance, a whole range of public goods that were mentioned

702
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:49,820
in many contexts.

703
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:55,420
So most of the, I mean, accentuated this took place in the US and UK, you can say,

704
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:01,100
neoliberal, harsh lands or the leading examples of that with Margaret Thatcher,

705
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:07,580
Ronald Reagan. But it started to creep in and affect, became some kind of a mobile policy

706
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,180
that was also in practice being implemented in other contexts.

707
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:16,700
Sometimes to a lesser expense in a more variegated way, etc.

708
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:23,580
And the whole research agenda by, for instance, Jamie Beck, a very nice and one of the leading

709
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:31,500
scholars in urban geography is about that. So what is neoliberalism? What is neoliberalization?

710
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,540
Is it the same everywhere? How variegated? How does it connect itself to different kinds of

711
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:43,180
context that's a holding here. So we see those ideas spreading a lot across a lot of these,

712
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:50,300
say, Western American, North American states. And in one way or another, it leads to some kind of

713
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:57,580
use of self-affirmative prophecy, because as the state retreats from certain areas, it

714
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:03,940
It regulates very often a lot of these markets, which

715
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,500
hands more power to large corporations.

716
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:13,220
And we already talked about multinational corporations last week.

717
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,940
And we see a rising concentration of power,

718
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,980
of industrial and financial conglomerations, et cetera, et cetera.

719
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,100
And indeed, in the process where also the state

720
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,620
is kind of rescaled, where a lot of responsibilities

721
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:34,180
kind of pushed to the local level, you get some kind of a self-fulling mantra of competing cities

722
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:43,220
to attract global capital. So that's kind of the situation where a lot of policymakers

723
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:53,140
could say in the 1980s, the 1980s were kind of facing a kind of zero-sum game where there's only

724
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:59,380
so much production for instance to take place so Amazon will have its center

725
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:06,100
either here or it will go across the border and what can we do about that?

726
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:12,660
Well David Harvey is one of the the the main scholars in this area he says

727
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:18,420
well what we see that a lot of policymakers are trying to do is they try to

728
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,380
to become entrepreneurial, right?

729
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:25,580
So whereas they were managing the territories

730
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:29,660
and trying to think about the spatial structures

731
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:33,820
of welfare, humanities, and to distribute growth

732
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,260
across the territory, you kind of get the flip side,

733
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,340
much more competitive idea about growth,

734
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,100
and a new kind of role for people

735
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,980
that were previously managing territories

736
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,500
to become some kind of entrepreneurs, right?

737
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:53,320
David Harvey talks about this in his famous piece and I think people in the

738
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,500
Muslim forces also discuss this with Matthew.

739
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:03,780
He describes the shift from urban managerialism to urban

740
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:10,300
entrepreneurs and where you get a different kind of mindset with boss.

741
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:15,100
Now, okay, so this is kind of the multiraceted structure,

742
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,460
but it's kind of the reasoning of how you could say

743
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,940
macro phenomena at some point,

744
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,660
did you a very particular urban reality?

745
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:26,580
And what David Harvey then does,

746
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:30,860
and this is a kind of a short excuse that I want to take you through.

747
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:34,620
What it says, okay, in these competitive circumstances,

748
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,620
we see that policymakers start to adopt a number of things.

749
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:44,660
a number of strategies and a number of entrepreneurs strategies and I'll take you through them.

750
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:50,980
Be advised and sometimes it's kind of interesting to see that people think there's kind of some

751
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:56,980
kind of a recipe by David Harvey say if your citizen trouble please consider

752
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:02,660
applying this strategy this is not what David Harvey does he kind of observes and

753
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:08,500
analyses this phenomena he's not prescribing some kind of entrepreneurial strategies that

754
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,540
that should be implemented by policymakers,

755
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:15,220
just to be clear, which reminds me of an anecdote

756
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:19,380
that Harvey once gave a lecture in New York.

757
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:24,180
And he's famous for his analysis or reading

758
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:28,620
of Das Kapital by my son, Marx.

759
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,660
Volume one is a very nice video on that.

760
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,340
He has a companion to capital.

761
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:37,340
And he also gave a lecture about that somewhere in New York.

762
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:40,680
And apparently there were also some investment bankers

763
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,840
in the room.

764
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,620
And after the lecture, his investment bankers

765
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,740
walked up to women and said, well, Mr. Harvey,

766
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,680
I think you have a very good understanding

767
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,920
of how finance capital works.

768
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,860
Would it be possible to hire you as a consultant?

769
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,000
(audience laughs)

770
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,920
I think he declined, but yeah, just to be very clear.

771
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,140
I mean, it's an analysis that he provides.

772
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:05,600
It's not a recipe that he thinks

773
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,560
should be installed.

774
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,400
All right.

775
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,000
So yeah, I mean, the first kind of thing that

776
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,360
is under pressure, if you will, is these productive activities.

777
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,080
And what it sees is that some policymakers

778
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,400
still manage to kind of keep productive activities

779
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,080
in their territories.

780
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,560
And that means that still there will be some public

781
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,320
and private investments.

782
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,280
And you could say the physical and social base

783
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,960
or physical and social infrastructure

784
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,320
So think about knowledge networks, educational facilities,

785
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,600
try to do a Spanish recap.

786
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,880
So sometimes the state becomes some kind of venture

787
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,040
capitalist itself.

788
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,960
But indeed, as has been described,

789
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,240
also try to work on all the things that are too costly,

790
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:56,760
reduce excessive labor costs, for instance,

791
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,560
tax breaks, et cetera, et cetera.

792
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,160
And quite often leading the idea

793
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:06,560
is that the city regions should become silicon valleys,

794
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,560
that that should be the ambition,

795
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,000
that they should seek to attract capital people.

796
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,040
Sometimes this kind of set to attract creative class

797
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,240
to refer to which Florida.

798
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,280
But it's kind of this idea that yes,

799
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,640
a high tech productive city is still

800
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,200
imaginable and we have to create the right business

801
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,560
environment to get there.

802
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:35,200
So images of clusters and there's a lot of cluster policy,

803
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,040
but it used to be, I think, in a lot of cities.

804
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,800
It's also the reason why you had dedicated districts

805
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:45,800
at cities linked to healthcare or biotech, et cetera, et cetera.

806
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,120
So that's kind of one stretch,

807
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,360
Gida is still imaginable for cities.

808
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,040
A second entrepreneurial strategy

809
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,880
is to compete for consumption.

810
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,160
So people have money to spend.

811
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,480
There's a spatial division of consumption.

812
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,760
What you want is that people spend their dollars,

813
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:09,560
euros, rupees in your country and your city

814
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,360
and not in the neighborhood city.

815
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,400
And obviously with globalization,

816
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,440
this kind of changes, we see the emergence of global tourism,

817
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,120
flows, et cetera, et cetera.

818
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,000
So there's a kind of battle, if you will,

819
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,720
to attract tourists, retirees,

820
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,960
that is a whole economy behind elderly homes

821
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,320
because, well, these are people who have pensions still,

822
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,720
and they provide a safe stream of income,

823
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:39,720
and you can say local consumption activities.

824
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,600
Now, there's a contradiction in capitalism there

825
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,680
because with the crisis of Fordism,

826
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,920
we see a decline in purchasing power.

827
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,680
The factor labor is typically less powerful.

828
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:56,800
So yeah, there's less money to spend.

829
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:05,640
people don't really see an increase in their real wages, as we've seen in the picture,

830
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,440
on New York, but this goes back to the 1970s for the new

831
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:16,040
pictures of the US that has been hardly any increase in real wages, despite huge productivity

832
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,320
growth.

833
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:29,040
So this conundrum in many cases has been resolved by reverting to credit, basically.

834
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:35,560
So instead of buying it from the salary that you have, there's an increased financialization

835
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:41,840
of the economy in the sense that a lot of households become dependent on credit, mostly

836
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:49,920
through banks to obtain housing, but increasingly also all other kinds of consumption goods,

837
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:57,520
goods, washing machines, cars, etc., etc. So this is kind of one way of solving that contradiction.

838
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:06,160
It's also trying to attract high income jobs because yeah, they have a lot of money to spend

839
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,960
and what form does it take?

840
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,840
Well, in many cases, it will have some impact on the social spatial structure.

841
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:19,760
It could be either state-led gentrification, it could be market-based gentrification.

842
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:26,160
In many cases, what you will see is that cities will try to become more attractive one way or

843
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:33,120
another by using heritage, architecture, and these are things that you will also talk with

844
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,040
with bus about cities are quite a fence formed into these kind of urban spectacles that are

845
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:46,240
collectively adding more value in the goods that are consumed there. So if you walk around

846
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,800
in spectacular neighborhood, you might be inclined to spend a bit more. Yes.

847
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,800
[ Inaudible ]

848
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,800
Yes.

849
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,800
[ Inaudible ]

850
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,800
[ Inaudible ]

851
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,800
So, we'll increase the work of the city like one in a photograph

852
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,800
and I'm not going to see it.

853
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,800
Oh, yeah.

854
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,800
[ Inaudible ]

855
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,800
Yeah.

856
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
[ Inaudible ]

857
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,800
And there was no really an attraction in the off-grid.

858
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,800
- Oh, sorry.

859
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:27,800
- Yeah, no, but it's kind of these examples of landmark buildings.

860
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,800
They're quite often they're used in large-scale reconversion.

861
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,800
Number one is, I think maybe you refer to Bill Bow.

862
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
All right, that's northern Spain.

863
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,800
So there was an open industrial area,

864
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,800
and I think it's in the 1990s already.

865
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,800
Spectacular urbanism in the sense that spectacular architecture

866
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,440
a tech-led architecture.

867
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,680
Usually there's some kind of un-global class

868
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,520
of what they call start attacks,

869
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,440
who are kind of at an old house and Zaha did her.

870
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,180
She passed away now.

871
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:01,880
Who connected these global circuits

872
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:06,000
and starts producing these kind of spectacular architectural

873
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,880
forms that then send the message to the world,

874
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,640
which can be then linked to city branding

875
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,520
or city marketing strategies, et cetera.

876
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,840
So the city in and of itself can be consumed,

877
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:22,840
but also plays a role in fueling consumption practices

878
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,280
within.

879
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,480
So that's kind of, if you're interested to hire,

880
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,320
David Hargner for that, he can advise you how to do that.

881
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,080
And then the third one is what he says is that

882
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,720
there's still an element of the previous system there,

883
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,120
but it's kind of transformed.

884
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,640
So, and you could say,

885
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,640
for this engineering system, the state had a role to kind of stimulate growth.

886
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,200
It was still capitalist growth, for sure,

887
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,280
across the territory somewhat evenly.

888
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:56,320
So, yeah, there's, you could say, general taxation,

889
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,080
there's a fund and it can be invested across the territory.

890
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:04,720
And lower level governments can still try to attract

891
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,360
some of that funding.

892
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,520
But it becomes increasingly,

893
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:14,200
You can say marketised as well, quite often you'll be competing with other cities and other

894
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:20,840
regions to start to attract these kinds of redistributive funds.

895
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,760
Just an overview of examples in the US, it's about where are military and defense

896
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,760
investments being made?

897
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,160
That's the story of Silicon Valley.

898
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:37,520
Europe is a lot of competition between regions for, for instance, regional development

899
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:45,120
funds which work on both competitiveness of regions, but also cohesion.

900
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,360
So it's not 100% evil or something like that.

901
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:58,480
But it's a mechanism to redistribute these kind of investments across a territory,

902
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,760
but increase, you can say, the capacity of these places from growth.

903
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:07,760
And at the same time also work towards providing amenities, child care, etc.

904
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,760
People that are joining me on Friday, I'll say a little bit more about that.

905
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,360
And basically to Brussels, the canals of for instance is one of these

906
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,760
so interactions for the European regional development.

907
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,760
When you look for people that know flounders a little bit,

908
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,760
you have stops finneving spray actin urban renewal project.

909
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:39,760
It's kind of led by foreigners and it's basically giving money to cities to reconvert

910
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,760
in a city neighbourhood.

911
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:49,280
And quite often you have to apply either you say, "Okay, I'm going to hand in a concept

912
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,280
node."

913
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:55,280
So you get some funding to develop your idea and then perhaps if you're a successful

914
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,720
later on you can attract funding by the Flamish government.

915
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:05,820
Thus far you see that it's mostly the central city's center speed and so the main

916
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:11,240
agglomerations that have the main capacity also to apply for these funds.

917
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:16,960
So it's not that all small cities can actually benefit from that.

918
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,960
There was a question.

919
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:23,160
I just wanted to say looking at that the way it orders like, does that play a great

920
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,920
in the district of Eastern Park.

921
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,360
Like looking at most of my church in part

922
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,520
of the government church that I have,

923
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,520
they're all running down the street.

924
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,240
So they're all running?

925
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,360
Oh, oh, yeah.

926
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,200
Yeah, that's it.

927
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,840
I mean, it is just like the blood can of like,

928
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,920
it's our past, but really it's like making choices

929
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,600
about whatever--

930
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,400
Yeah, our kind of thing.

931
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,960
Yeah, who is going to pay for this in the future?

932
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,600
Yeah.

933
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,400
So there's a question, okay, governments don't have money, how can you be talking about

934
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,400
surplus?

935
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,640
I think what I'm talking about is the surplus that has been created in the economy, which

936
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:09,120
is not necessarily the same as the government budget, which is under conditions of what

937
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:13,600
I would hope for a new austerity is kept small.

938
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:19,520
And then the only thing that you can do is, yeah, okay, we're going to become more efficient.

939
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:26,640
And a mantra that you hear often will basically have very small cuts across the board.

940
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:34,960
So I think it used to be, say, more in the previous thread, especially to post-17, something

941
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:42,840
like that, that the allocation problem was smaller because the fiscal base was larger,

942
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:47,560
there was more economic growth, which could be more easily taxed.

943
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:54,680
out, you can say, hurting corporations or people or workers. It's only at the point where

944
01:16:54,680 --> 01:17:03,080
you can say, and yeah, there was a kind of stagnation of profits that it became very hard for

945
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:13,080
governments. Yeah, to how would I put this to maintain fiscal level without eating into the

946
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,880
the profits of the corporations that were still there.

947
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,880
So it's kind of a, yeah, it became a very awkward situation.

948
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,320
So they rather kind of cut back on expenditures,

949
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,480
running to increase, for instance, corporate tax rates.

950
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:33,040
So that could have been one way of dealing with that,

951
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:38,320
thinking about raising productivity levels in another way

952
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,960
by investing in technology, et cetera, et cetera.

953
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:46,480
that has happened to some extent, but it has merely answered across the board. I think the main,

954
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:55,840
I would say, trend was to keep the check on the wages of people. So yeah, this, when I talk about

955
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,240
surplus is kind of more what kind of wealth is created within the capitalist system,

956
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:08,160
rather than more in account, in terms of what the government runs a surplus or a benefit,

957
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,520
or a deficit, just to be clear there.

958
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:17,960
But yeah, despite the fact that even if there's

959
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,640
the smaller budgets available, also the allocation

960
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,080
mechanism has changed, it has become less

961
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:30,040
kind of an element of how would I put this managing

962
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,880
kind of growth across the territory,

963
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:35,600
it has become more of a competition really.

964
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,160
And you see, for instance, these urban renewal projects

965
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:42,480
and flowers, there's a competition to attract these funds

966
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,440
to your city.

967
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:48,720
And that's-- yeah, you see that it leads to some kind of--

968
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,520
when it takes a goal for an almond.

969
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,400
I mean, the planet's government is reflexive about that.

970
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,640
So it's not extreme that it's all to one city,

971
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,880
but still there's a tendency that some cities benefit a bit

972
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,840
more from that than others.

973
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:05,360
And that's always a tendency.

974
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,920
Yeah, I'm taking a lot of time.

975
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:12,240
Then the next kind of final one,

976
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:17,440
and then we kind of end the exchirs and go back to discussion

977
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,880
about command and control and role cities,

978
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,640
the kind of final strategy is to make sure

979
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,760
that in the international division of labor

980
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,040
in these global production networks and global financial

981
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,280
networks that you hold these functions of command and control.

982
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,920
And the state is a specific kind of entrepreneurialism.

983
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,720
Well, you're invest in physical connectivity,

984
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,960
digital connectivity nowadays.

985
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,400
Now you invest in, could say, supply side economics.

986
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,240
I've heard that a little bit.

987
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:54,000
So state of the art, districts, that's

988
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,920
there to attract international corporations

989
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,760
and see the federal and central business districts.

990
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,280
that what I mean with that, also invest in educating

991
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,440
the labor force, thinking about installing business

992
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,760
schools for instance in front of one of the leading financial

993
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:18,760
center in Germany, the university has its business school

994
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,760
financed by Deutsche Bank.

995
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,480
So there's lectures by people working at Deutsche Bank,

996
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:30,800
educating the new generation of critical social scientists.

997
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,000
Okay.

998
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,000
So, this kind of dynamic is particularly attaching itself to world cities and the kind of

999
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,080
idea is that if you attract these global functions, it will indeed set in motion some kind

1000
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,200
of a trickle down effect.

1001
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:52,240
It will inflate property prices because there will, as we have learned with bad prisoners,

1002
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:56,760
they become part of international portfolios, etc.

1003
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:02,280
So that's kind of the strategy that is set there.

1004
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:07,120
Okay, let's have a quick break, five minutes,

1005
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,640
and then we actually get to the polarization thesis,

1006
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,200
which is taking all the time today.

1007
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:18,320

(muffled speaking)

01:28:52,120 --> 01:29:07,160
Okay, so we have this brief ex-curse learning about different

1114
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:13,960
entrepreneurial strategies, and I think what I wanted to show is that there's a wide

1115
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:19,680
restructuring of the economy, and we can place growing global city formation within that

1116
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,520
as one particular strategy, okay?

1117
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:27,920
Or one particular process that is explicitly relevant for world cities.

1118
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:35,000
Going back a little bit more to the discussion about how does this connect with polarization?

1119
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Well, as we found there's this, and it's mostly treatment involved, treatment and

1120
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,320
testing.

1121
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:49,000
The starting point was this observation of a change in the economic base.

1122
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,600
Generally, the decline in well-paid manufacturing jobs, which is some kind of an exodus

1123
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:02,600
because of globalization of production, and at the same time a restructuring of the economy

1124
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:10,640
what services, as we have seen 80% of cities, is service-based, but it's both at the

1125
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:19,120
high end and at the low end, both formal services, service markers and informal service.

1126
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:24,360
So what kind of polarization these says? Well, there's something particular about these

1127
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:31,360
command and control functions that fuels this polarization process.

1128
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:40,360
Please take a seat.

1129
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:48,360
Okay.

1130
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:53,360
Please do a leaf roll.

1131
01:30:53,360 --> 01:31:00,080
So there's something particular about these APS and headquarters economies that will set

1132
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,600
in motion polarization, okay?

1133
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:09,680
So at one point this, you can say competition within the APM and the APS complex itself,

1134
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:16,560
which will lead to an idea of outsourcing, getting rid of some kind of long-core activities.

1135
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:25,240
quite often leads to low-key kind of activities that are all and a lot of context also

1136
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:32,240
linked to some form of informal economy and a lot of migrant labor that takes care of

1137
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:40,840
routine service jobs. Think about community functions, think about, well, the Xerox machine

1138
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:43,960
and those kind of things, clerical work, etc.

1139
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:51,300
Next to that, what you also see is that with these high end functions, or these command

1140
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:59,440
and control functions, it comes with the influx of well-selling people that have a lot

1141
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:06,800
of the spending power, that have their own desire for forms of housing, quite often this

1142
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:14,240
sets in motion process of gentrification, so the displacement of initial populations.

1143
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:19,800
And it's also at the level of consumption and growth of leisure activities that this needs

1144
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:20,800
to transformation.

1145
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:27,080
Okay, so if you host these activities, basically the managers, the CEOs, people in business

1146
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:31,760
service, just advanced producer services, well, they have the whole ecology of control

1147
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:41,120
amenities and hortic arts etc. So this also creates some kind of demand for low-income jobs

1148
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:49,280
to cater quite literally to these elites. There is something particular about world cities

1149
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:56,560
which makes that there will be an even more augmented process of polarization compared to

1150
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:01,560
normal cities or wider territories.

1151
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,520
And the end result, the idea is that you get with,

1152
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,640
you get a different structure or income distribution

1153
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,760
in the sense that there's a lot of growth of jobs

1154
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:18,200
at the very top, there's a growth of jobs at the bottom

1155
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,080
of income distribution.

1156
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,960
And in general, because of the decline in one page

1157
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:27,280
all remunerated stable manufacturing jobs,

1158
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,320
there's a kind of a decrease of middle income groups

1159
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,680
and you end up with an hourglass, okay?

1160
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,200
So something like that, okay?

1161
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:40,360
That one, this kind of figure shows how that works.

1162
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,440
It's a bit hard to decide for here,

1163
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,360
but there's the growth of M,

1164
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,840
which is a part of managerial class.

1165
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:53,200
So CEOs of international corporations

1166
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,760
Link to that is P is a kind of the producer services

1167
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,480
or the long business services that we're

1168
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,960
going to be talking about.

1169
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,160
Then below that, C is all kinds of terrible tasks.

1170
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,440
OK.

1171
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:10,600
Minial tasks and kind of taking care of administration,

1172
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,960
such as et cetera.

1173
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,640
In the current day and age, these activities

1174
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,400
are also kind of being localized and off-shore,

1175
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,920
and of themselves, the 1980s, that their back office

1176
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:24,920
works still to place in global cities.

1177
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:28,360
So at the same time, you say, a growth,

1178
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:32,440
you say, in informal markets or informal parts of the economy.

1179
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:39,680
And these are often also based on, on micro play.

1180
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:46,760
For instance, what I have here, I mean, all these kind of amenities

1181
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:50,080
that we're talking about, Hordika,

1182
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:53,280
leisure activities, kind of support by that.

1183
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:57,160
There's informal production facilities

1184
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,080
that are re-emerging in cities.

1185
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,560
And then, yeah, the assumption moves and other kinds of things

1186
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,880
that are also emerging there in connection

1187
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:12,320
to the rise of this APS complex and global corporation.

1188
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,520
So in general, what you need to remember

1189
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:22,160
is you have an exodus of these high wage manufacturing jobs, that's what kind of is the main

1190
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:32,000
infrastructure and a kind of influx of workers often from a global scale of foreign migrant workers

1191
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:39,840
that quite often end up in informal labor markets. No that I still have this one, you don't mind how

1192
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,640
So a general structure of this labor market and importantly and what sets

1193
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:53,280
more than global cities apart from you could say. Rest of the territory or small cities

1194
01:35:53,280 --> 01:36:00,480
is that this labor market becomes globalized. And it speaks, you say, both sides of this

1195
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:09,680
hourglass that works at the top level, we have the high-paid migrants and it works also at the lower

1196
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,680
of income distribution.

1197
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:14,680
And quite interestingly,

1198
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:17,680
sometimes quite cynically,

1199
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,680
there's also different terminologies for that.

1200
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,680
So people at the high end,

1201
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,680
it doesn't really matter

1202
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,680
or they're kind of not seen as immigrants,

1203
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,680
but these are expats.

1204
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,680
Quite often, for instance, in Belgium,

1205
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,680
they enjoy quite interesting text regimes.

1206
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,680
This is the day this question has to,

1207
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:38,680
whether it would be a nice idea to actually text expats

1208
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:46,880
that's in Belgium. So these are kind of seen as people that bring in a lot of

1209
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:53,920
expertise, a lot of value that make a city very competitive in this global war

1210
01:36:53,920 --> 01:37:01,280
for talent whereas people that are for us in the lower paid jobs by seen as

1211
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,720
immigrants, right, or foreigners, etc.

1212
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:12,000
Okay, so there's a lot of terms that are being used there that are take part of very

1213
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,140
performative and normalizing the situation.

1214
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:24,880
So the way we talk about these divisions matters, I think.

1215
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:37,960
So what we see is also a growth of low-skilled or these skills, migrant workers.

1216
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:45,560
So either people that have middle-ableification in the country of origin and come to a world

1217
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:50,480
of global city or people that have qualifications.

1218
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:57,280
for some reason because they cross the border have lost proof of that. So a lot of

1219
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:03,680
contacts, even if you're educated in one or one in the other direction, you have to

1220
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:09,680
kind of be accredited for that. So you have to, your diploma needs to be certified to be

1221
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:15,680
able to access the labor market in one way or another. In and of itself, it's quite an

1222
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:22,960
interesting process, but it means that a lot of people, especially in informal migration,

1223
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:28,480
not being in the position to actually do that. So they may have all kinds of skills, but they

1224
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:34,720
can't formally use them. So this is kind of the first of these scaling that is going on. Now,

1225
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:40,480
what it creates, especially in the place where you have a wall of immigration, that's typically

1226
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:47,600
world in global cities. It just creates a very large pool of people that have a very poor,

1227
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:56,000
you can say that are not really empowered, that don't have a bargain power to negotiate about their

1228
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:03,200
wages. And if they don't do it well somebody else will. And this kind of the notion of a reserve

1229
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:11,280
army of labor, a lot of people that are in flux that will basically take any job.

1230
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:17,160
And you see in that case, you see the emergence of what people call 3D jobs, dirty demanding

1231
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:20,480
and dangerous or dirty dangers and difficult.

1232
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:29,600
A lot of migrant labor in Roman drug cities ends up in these kind of segments.

1233
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:37,360
And these are typically jobs that people, that kind of the natives, if you will, are willing

1234
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,360
to do.

1235
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:47,400
And I mean, Chris, if you look at the whole debate about the fallout of Brexit, it had

1236
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:55,160
been driven tremendously while in anti-immigrant, they are stealing our jobs sentiment.

1237
01:39:55,160 --> 01:40:03,080
now that the economy is kind of crippled by not having access to fuel because there's no truck

1238
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:09,640
drivers to actually or migrant truck drivers to actually bring the fuel to to pump stations,

1239
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:17,080
gas stations, where you can refill your car. So it's kind of history with the vengeance there

1240
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:24,680
and it kind of shows the crucial dependence of our economy in a lot of cities on that migrant

1241
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:31,680
and a lot of essential services that is absolutely undervalued in societal terms.

1242
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:42,680
Yeah, and then what is actually quite interesting to see in it's also work by Farskya Susson

1243
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:47,680
when she was still married as Susson Group.

1244
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:55,680
Yeah, a lot of these activities are informal or connected to floating populations, people that are

1245
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:05,680
residing temporarily in cities that may be trans migrants move on when we're not doing.

1246
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:11,680
And yeah, they form the context of, you could say, potential exploitation.

1247
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:16,680
It's not necessarily happening, but it's kind of a context where people that want to take advantage

1248
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:20,600
advantage can more easily do that.

1249
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:26,160
It can be sometimes for very good reasons,

1250
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:29,480
say, OK, I want to help somebody.

1251
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:34,400
And I'll let you lose my house or take care of the children.

1252
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:39,240
And I'll pay you the minimum wage or something like that.

1253
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:43,640
That could be the position of a middle class family

1254
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,200
in a global city,

1255
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,200
but at the same time,

1256
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,880
there's this structural discrimination

1257
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,440
of these groups in society.

1258
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,320
They may be well suited to take other jobs in society,

1259
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,360
but yeah, they're kind of forced into them.

1260
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,120
So it's kind of in combination with a large group of people

1261
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,600
that are looking for jobs,

1262
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:08,920
the informal character allows a lot of informal potential forms

1263
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:11,560
of exploitation.

1264
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,880
And this is what Khos, the parapherilization at the core.

1265
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,380
So what she says is that, typically we think about exploitation

1266
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:23,840
as a relation between the global north or the global south.

1267
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,640
Actually it's taking place.

1268
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,520
It re-enters the global north.

1269
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:29,960
So in rural and global cities, you can also

1270
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:35,560
find this, these exploitative relations

1271
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:41,440
because the global south is actually living in world

1272
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:46,880
and global cities that have raised the relation remains exploited.

1273
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,400
Okay, so the racial realization of the core.

1274
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,600
Just to figure to illustrate this,

1275
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,000
is to refer a little bit to research on this.

1276
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
So as a whole strand of research looking into urban belief networks,

1277
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,640
some kind of interesting work with him Carol looking

1278
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:08,000
at interlocking direct rates.

1279
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:20,240
it's one way of measuring the connections between cities by looking at the overlaps between

1280
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:27,520
the board of directors of board of directors of board of directors. So one member of the board

1281
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:35,600
sitting on different boards. So for instance, for this bunk Belgium and B&D buddy buff

1282
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:41,440
Paris or something like that. And we see actually in this picture there's quite a strong

1283
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:49,120
connection between Brussels and Paris, but it shows that as we live in a kind of global economy,

1284
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:56,960
the corporate world has globalized. There's also the social structure there behind that of a

1285
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:02,640
traveling global elite with a lot of power decision-making power that is connecting

1286
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:08,560
and this kind of place. So if you're a board of directors of, and the board of directors,

1287
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:18,320
ten or 15 corporations, well you will be, you say traveling around in first class between these places

1288
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:28,000
and go from Citadel to Citadel. Okay. I also did a little bit of research into how this looks

1289
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,640
and Islamic markets and I found actually quite similar things. The geographies look different,

1290
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:40,880
but what I hope that is how governance structures work is. Islamic banks,

1291
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:45,040
and there you find that next to the typical board of directors,

1292
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:52,720
they also have a Sharia board and these boards basically review and what extent the activities of banks

1293
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:59,680
are in line with the shayya. So are they hollow or are they not a

1294
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:00,320
participant?

1295
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:09,760
It's hollow. And yeah, it's very similar to what I found in the previous figure in the sense that

1296
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:16,240
it's also very concentrated social geography. So it's very concentrated in a very limited set of

1297
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:25,360
scholars, some of them sit on the board, 50 different corporations, which creates

1298
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:29,760
all kinds of interesting things as to to what extent is this so credible that they

1299
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:35,360
will review the share with the compliant character or other things going on.

1300
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:44,800
You see there's a connection with New York. Well at some point, go in sex also was planning to

1301
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:52,160
to go into Islamic markets and there was a whole controversy as to what extends their financial

1302
01:45:52,160 --> 01:46:00,720
product was actually reviewed by Sharia scholars or whether this was some kind of a religious

1303
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:10,880
effort, etc. There was a huge lashback by Sharia scholars, by this entire community and

1304
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,320
in the end of the materialized.

1305
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:15,320
But just to show you that there's different ways

1306
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,920
of approaching these networks,

1307
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,800
but it's the existence of those kind of structures

1308
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,080
that allows us to understand what kind of activity

1309
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:27,680
state plays at that level and how you can effect

1310
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:29,520
say income structure,

1311
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,000
because they're extremely well-remunerated

1312
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,840
and will reside in different kinds of places.

1313
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,280
Now at the other end,

1314
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:59,280
what I was talking about is these new forms of industrial exploitation in these sweatshops. So yeah, what are these kind of sweatshops? You may have heard of that kind of the renaissance of very old forms of exploitation or industrial organization.

1315
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,640
You may have heard about in Middle East,

1316
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:07,840
you have the putting out system where people in the household and in the countryside

1317
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:17,760
were actually producing at a peace-by-peace salary textiles for capitalists and cities.

1318
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:22,320
It's kind of reinvented in the 20th and 21st century.

1319
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:26,880
So, flat shops are these small units, usually underground,

1320
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:31,880
or in secluded spaces, often in a text that industry,

1321
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:36,400
that works through all these kind of subcontracting deals.

1322
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:40,320
So you never quite know who is really hiring people.

1323
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:44,520
So there's different kind of layers of governance there.

1324
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:48,320
And a lot of people, yeah, are indeed paid by the piece

1325
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:52,280
or have daily or weekly contracts,

1326
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:56,320
which is extremely precarious as you may understand.

1327
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:01,320
And yeah, we see that it's kind of the emerge.

1328
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,920
And it was, say, the 19th century.

1329
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:09,320
It took place in a lot of industrializing cities.

1330
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:13,800
It went away and, for instance, in the US,

1331
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:18,480
you see that because there was all kind of trade unions,

1332
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:23,440
initiatives, regulations were adapted.

1333
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:32,160
for instance in relation to the new deal just before the second world war, which made

1334
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:38,600
this practically impossible. So it was in a context where you had far less migrant labor

1335
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:45,520
where actually possible to regulate those markets. But as kind of return to the 1990s, this

1336
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:53,160
kind of all of a sudden is back. These are very old data but in the 1990s, calculated I think

1337
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:58,840
between 4500 and 4500, 7000 textile companies

1338
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,040
there and then in New York, actually, sweatshows.

1339
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:04,960
So, you think about world's deformation,

1340
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:10,800
it's not just these glitz and glam offices with bankers.

1341
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,360
At the same time, it's very old forms of exploitation

1342
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:19,040
that are made possible by complete absence

1343
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:23,840
of any labor rights protection.

1344
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,860
So yeah, the places in China down at the lower east

1345
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:33,520
and these kind of situations are still occurring.

1346
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:41,520
Now, then to turn a little bit to I would say criticism

1347
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,360
or critiques of the polarization thesis,

1348
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:47,840
because it seems to be a very kind of elegant thesis

1349
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,440
right as the restructuring of the economy.

1350
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,360
At the same time there's globalization.

1351
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,600
It leads to the traction of headquarters

1352
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,440
in APS functions.

1353
01:49:57,440 --> 01:50:00,040
And this kind of adds to a wider process

1354
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,680
of income and professional polarization,

1355
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:05,960
which then they also leads to social spatial polarization.

1356
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:08,400
Because people, but different kind of income groups,

1357
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:11,120
may not necessarily live in the same places.

1358
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:14,080
Quite on the contrary, if they have very different lifestyles,

1359
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,920
they may want to live something else.

1360
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:23,480
The same time also the empirical base is mostly linked to a limited set of cases in

1361
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:25,720
York, London, Tokyo.

1362
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:35,160
So especially in 1990s when this became a major debate, the question is is Susson right

1363
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:41,240
or is Susson wrong to put it in the words of Chris Hamlet, who is also one of you sitting

1364
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:44,160
in counterforces in this debate.

1365
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,600
So for instance according to Hamnet,

1366
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:49,560
yeah, it's very critical of this full organization

1367
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,360
as we also briefly discussed before.

1368
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:55,680
It says, well, it's an all purpose general signifier.

1369
01:50:55,680 --> 01:51:01,320
And in the end, yeah, it doesn't really explain much

1370
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,560
and we don't necessarily need to describe

1371
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:07,640
what is going on in particular world cities.

1372
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:11,200
So what he says is that next to polarization,

1373
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:15,240
This whole process is thinking, right?

1374
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:18,040
We can think about a proletarianization,

1375
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:20,240
so that's the emergence of, say,

1376
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:24,240
an exploited underclass, if you will,

1377
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:27,680
to use that term in society as the main trend,

1378
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,560
or it could also be professionalization,

1379
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:33,040
which somehow refers to social mobility,

1380
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:37,200
the rise of middle income jobs, et cetera, et cetera.

1381
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:40,600
So instead of assuming that world and global city

1382
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:44,480
information necessarily reduces polarization.

1383
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:47,560
It's actually a research question, empirical question,

1384
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:50,480
what is going on in cities?

1385
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:55,480
So rather than just saying, OK, this is a disease

1386
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:57,840
or a given fact.

1387
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,560
It may be a hypothesis to see to what extent

1388
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:04,600
we see evidence of polarization or whether we see

1389
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,520
other things.

1390
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,920
And one thing of doing that is also

1391
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,320
taking more into account the occupational structure

1392
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:15,120
and the spatial structure of cities.

1393
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:20,200
So to tell a bit more about this occupational structure,

1394
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,960
what it talks about this hamlet,

1395
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,760
and this is kind of an interesting evolution.

1396
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:30,760
In the 1990s, he mostly looked at the case of London.

1397
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:35,760
And he says, well, what we find in New York,

1398
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:40,120
I'm not necessarily find that in the case of London.

1399
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:42,520
There's actually very little polarization

1400
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,920
what I find is professionalization.

1401
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:50,000
So yes, there's a growth of high income jobs,

1402
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,440
but it's not necessarily linked to an explosion

1403
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,720
of jobs at the bottom.

1404
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:58,480
So it's not really an hour to us.

1405
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,600
At the same time, we also see evidence

1406
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:03,840
of a growth in middle income jobs.

1407
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:10,320
And a lot of people can move up, you could say,

1408
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:14,760
the occupational structure can be trained,

1409
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:22,280
can get a training, and are professionalizing.

1410
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:27,760
So yeah, he doesn't find the pattern of what

1411
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:32,240
seemed to be the two expected pattern of New York.

1412
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,560
That same time, he says, well, it could

1413
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:42,040
be related to the fact that migration is there and then far less the case.

1414
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:46,280
It's also incomparable to what you find in New York.

1415
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:52,440
So you had migration obviously to London, but it was less globalized.

1416
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:58,000
It was mostly a link to you can say to the dreadnits of empire,

1417
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,760
but it wasn't of the scale of what you found in New York.

1418
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:06,280
And silly says, yeah, there's also a much more general,

1419
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:11,400
well-frest date where you compare it to what you can do.

1420
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:15,080
So let us just, OK, let's not exaggerate.

1421
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:17,040
We don't really find polarization.

1422
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:22,480
Other pathways are actually thinkable.

1423
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:28,440
And then what we actually find in such context

1424
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:33,320
that it might be something that kind of more intersects

1425
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:38,320
with, you could say, process of privilege

1426
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:44,200
that intersects with gender, roles in society

1427
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:45,280
and ethnicity.

1428
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:49,760
So it's less the whole discussion about, yes,

1429
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:54,760
this APS complex that start to transform into a labor market.

1430
01:54:54,760 --> 01:55:00,400
Now it's actually wider dimensions of gender and ethnic

1431
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:05,240
languages in society that will explain what we find in labor markets.

1432
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:09,240
So friends as well by Susan, Fangstein, and colleagues,

1433
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:17,240
they look at the exclusion by female labor in high end jobs.

1434
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:23,040
Or friends as the work by John Wilson, John May and colleagues.

1435
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:28,040
If we got one of the first may of the co-author is,

1436
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:32,320
is this okay, look, we have to look much more

1437
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:34,520
at necessity to understand what is going on

1438
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:38,680
because for instance, one third of London's

1439
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:41,480
for the Pina population is actually

1440
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,920
in health and social care.

1441
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:45,400
Brazilians are in cleaning services.

1442
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:52,000
Sick are hired as security guards,

1443
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:58,720
majority guards, a jereons are running the metro system, etc. etc. etc.

1444
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:04,760
So, these kind of more general processes will tell us much more about what is going on.

1445
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:12,240
Now, what we find is that when you start looking at more recent work at London, is that

1446
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:19,880
this whole argument that that long as somehow exclude or protect it from processes of

1447
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:23,760
All theization doesn't really seem to hold.

1448
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:24,760
Yep, there's a question.

1449
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:28,320
- I'm doing the question.

1450
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:31,320
There are the scores for our game

1451
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:36,000
that was known increased in lower intervals.

1452
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,800
They tried to also include one formal,

1453
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:43,800
yeah, the general point or something.

1454
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:46,920
- I think that's one of the reasons,

1455
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,240
that's a very good point.

1456
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:51,360
And I think that's one of the differences between,

1457
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:54,760
for instance, the work of May and colleagues

1458
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:58,560
and the conclusions by Chris Hamditz

1459
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:03,040
who is focusing on formal occupational structures.

1460
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,440
So indeed, that's the first point,

1461
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:08,120
mythological question, is this basically

1462
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:10,760
resolved with the data that is being used?

1463
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:13,600
And actually what you find is that

1464
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:16,660
in the article that was in the reader,

1465
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:18,420
which is a way more recent one.

1466
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:22,460
He also admits that process of polarization

1467
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:24,340
are going on and long.

1468
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:26,100
Okay, so it's kind of,

1469
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:29,980
he has seen the lights, Chris Hemmott.

1470
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:32,140
And that's kind of, yeah,

1471
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:33,980
I just referring to this paper.

1472
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:36,060
It's kind of very interesting paper

1473
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:37,440
because it's really targets

1474
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:41,220
migrant groups here in the sense that they look

1475
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:45,500
at regulation and kind of jobs

1476
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:50,500
that are being done by people that typically are not part of official statistics.

1477
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:58,500
And yeah, it's kind of hard to draw conclusions from that and say, okay,

1478
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,500
for instance, if you look at this picture,

1479
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:05,500
this kind of showing the division across different kind of

1480
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:17,500
So they collected responses by over 300 people in informal markets.

1481
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:26,500
Yeah, you find that only 9% actually earns the living wage.

1482
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:34,500
So it really shows that there's an overlay between the environment labor and

1483
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,300
or working conditions.

1484
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:39,800
But at the same time, it doesn't give you an overview

1485
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:41,700
of the entire structure of the labor market.

1486
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:45,780
So it's kind of a con-draw systemic conclusion from that.

1487
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:48,780
But if you've seen these compare it to this kind of picture,

1488
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:53,860
which is not about income, but there's about job equality.

1489
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:58,620
So it's a very rough marker of, you can say, yeah,

1490
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:02,540
where in the social hierarchy or occupational hierarchy

1491
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:03,900
are we at?

1492
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:06,100
There you see that there's actually a growth

1493
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:09,980
in the kind of the shitty jobs, if you will,

1494
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:16,340
a stagnation between the drive of normal decent jobs

1495
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:19,060
and a large growth at the top.

1496
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:21,980
So in these kind of indicators that the

1497
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:23,740
with occupational structure,

1498
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:27,660
it's counter evidence towards the profession andization.

1499
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,620
So I think what happens here is that

1500
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:38,820
When Chris Hamlet was writing his argument against Sussman in the 1990s, it may have still been true.

1501
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:47,860
It may have been biased by looking at formal statistics, not capturing what was going on

1502
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:54,020
at the bottom because it was basically part of the informal economy. But then even with that,

1503
01:59:54,820 --> 02:00:01,620
As time has passed the picture even in the form of market which is no longer lower as he would have described it.

1504
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:10,420
So it's kind of a process of restructuring that has only been initiated later, I think, compared to to North North.

1505
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:17,220
Okay, but in any case, I think it's also not necessarily the same way.

1506
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:24,220
to say, okay, Susson is right or Hamlet is wrong.

1507
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:28,540
Point is that we have to identify different processes

1508
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,540
that can actually take place at the same time.

1509
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:34,540
So you can imagine ant polarization and professionalization

1510
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:35,460
at the same time.

1511
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:38,260
It's not because you see polarization

1512
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:41,500
that some segments of the population

1513
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:44,660
actually undergo social mobility.

1514
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:46,820
In fact, it could actually be quite interesting question

1515
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:49,460
in the context of polarization,

1516
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:52,900
who is still able to improve oneself on the labor market

1517
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,740
and who is not.

1518
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:57,100
So I think that for me was kind of the gist

1519
02:00:57,100 --> 02:01:02,100
of the article by Chris Hamlet's there.

1520
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:06,020
Okay, let me move on because again, running out of time.

1521
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:10,420
So yeah, looking more closely at the occupational structure,

1522
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:14,460
I can't possibly go beyond that,

1523
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:17,180
that it gives you a hint of what to look for.

1524
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:19,660
Second element is spatial structure, right?

1525
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:22,180
So a very important critique principle

1526
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:26,660
is using the same steam is to what extent

1527
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:29,740
are the result of polarization?

1528
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:32,300
It is also a statistical artifact.

1529
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:37,060
There's a lot of focus on cities,

1530
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:38,380
but we at the same time,

1531
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:41,860
we know that middle classes have been suburbanizing

1532
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:44,060
or are still suburbanizing.

1533
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:48,740
So maybe this whole disappearance of a metal income

1534
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:50,820
jobs from cities and the fact that you

1535
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:53,060
end up with a very polarized labor market,

1536
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:56,900
it could be some kind of an artifact.

1537
02:01:56,900 --> 02:02:00,420
So yeah, I think that's something to take into account.

1538
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:02,820
That's also quite interesting to compare,

1539
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:06,740
you could say differences between what we did in New York

1540
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:09,100
State versus New York City.

1541
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:12,700
I think you can't say that there's no general trend

1542
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:18,540
kind of in decline of middle income jobs for instance in the case of the US.

1543
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:24,880
But it's perhaps less accentuated than if you only look at the very need city

1544
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:30,020
center. So there's always an impossibility that wealth is suburbanized and

1545
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:34,600
would give you a different question. So scale matters, space matters in the

1546
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:39,780
sense that you have to be aware that you need to kind of map the appropriate

1547
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:43,140
and metropolitan area to turn the stance

1548
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:45,100
the entire structure of the labor market.

1549
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:46,500
Okay.

1550
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:49,260
Now, yeah, and there it can go many ways

1551
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:51,020
in sense that you also have to be sensitive

1552
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:56,020
to what extent you say these higher incomes

1553
02:02:56,020 --> 02:02:57,500
will drive gentrification.

1554
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:02,180
There has been a whole process of moving out of cities,

1555
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:04,940
but there's also been a return to the city.

1556
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:07,260
When you take a city like Brussels,

1557
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:11,820
I think I would say, it's around to be a doubt that has been a return of middle incomes.

1558
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:17,500
And a lot of places, really leading world cities, has been of the super rich,

1559
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:24,140
setting a motion process of what Loretta Lee's calls super gentrification.

1560
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:31,180
And just one example of that is, and I refer to that on the map, Brooklyn used to be, you could say,

1561
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:41,020
a nice suburb of New York, just across the river, which was still affordable.

1562
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:48,060
You can put it on these brown stones, but what she described is how actually the top

1563
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:56,460
earners in New York are increasingly buying in these property markets.

1564
02:03:56,460 --> 02:04:03,460
So we see that almost half of all Brooklyn was owned by the top 10%.

1565
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:11,860
In that period, you see it tremendous growth and orientation of property values in that period.

1566
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:19,060
So you really have to look at the detailed level within a city how you could say these higher incomes.

1567
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:25,560
Yeah, what kind of spatial process they set in motion and sometimes at least here is a classification.

1568
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:29,480
in a city neighborhoods, and maybe more peripheral processes, etc.

1569
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:33,240
So there's no unified spatial structure there.

1570
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:38,520
It's just a question if we have a structure of the economy.

1571
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:41,160
Where does it specially attaches itself?

1572
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:42,360
OK.

1573
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:47,480
Another example is for instance Brussels, where we find that,

1574
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:52,040
I could say, raw city formation and buses often,

1575
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:56,760
Europeanization of the economy and all kind of functions that are laid to that,

1576
02:04:56,760 --> 02:05:01,160
how it has kind of reinforced existing social spatial divides.

1577
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:05,880
And this is work by, and now, a Middle-to-S professor from K.

1578
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:13,400
You live in the discussative group who looked at the evolution of,

1579
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:19,080
you can say, migrant populations and expect populations, sorry for that divide again.

1580
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:25,040
but it's being used in reality in Brussels.

1581
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:29,680
And what you see is that you could say typically the population

1582
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:35,960
with a lower income, the Moroccan population has grown

1583
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:44,640
in the western part of the city area, which is called the Puso

1584
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:49,640
the poor crescent, which is kind of the leading imaginary

1585
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:52,140
there, also with policymakers.

1586
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:55,140
Whereas you can take real Europeanization,

1587
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:59,840
has attracted a lot of expats, mostly Americans,

1588
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:04,840
and other kind of people from the European Union,

1589
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:10,240
mostly settled in the south eastern part of Brussels.

1590
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:15,840
And what Krskastalop explains is that in this geography,

1591
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:20,840
it's kind of reproducing early rounds of division in Brussels.

1592
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:24,840
And then it's kind of no coincidence that

1593
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:29,840
people with a Moroccan ethnicity and the northwest

1594
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:33,840
has something to do with the wider process of migrant labor,

1595
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:37,840
guest labor from the 1950s and '60s.

1596
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:45,120
I can say a lot about that, but the bottom line is, Belgian government actually went to Morocco,

1597
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:53,920
but also Turkey recently to really, you can say, brand Belgium as the place to work.

1598
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:58,280
A lot of migrant workers brought their families.

1599
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:01,440
They were seen as temporary guest workers.

1600
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:06,560
The entities people decided, yes, we were going to build a family here.

1601
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:11,080
And he actually worked in all kinds of productive activities and Brussels.

1602
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:16,680
Who went across the 1960s, '70s?

1603
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:23,120
And so you could say globalization of production also had a huge impact on these kind of jobs.

1604
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:29,920
A lot of these migrant workers were faced with structural employment and were kind of locked

1605
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:32,800
in into these situations.

1606
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:35,960
And yeah, never really got out of there.

1607
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:42,880
So there's still a large unemployment rate.

1608
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:49,520
And what we find is that with the restructuring of the economy, just at the time when

1609
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:55,920
new jobs were being created, there were the jobs that were not really matching the profile

1610
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:56,920
of these casework.

1611
02:07:56,920 --> 02:08:01,080
So there was a lot of service work.

1612
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:08,680
Yeah, I mean it's required training which was not necessarily offered to make that transition within one generation.

1613
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:14,760
So that's why you kind of see this kind of pattern reproduce.

1614
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:19,240
So the argument by this cast of all this that we should really look also into

1615
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:24,520
looking at the continuities in these spatial structures.

1616
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:31,760
The friends also find that in contemporary elite geographies of pipe, continuing a little

1617
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:38,440
bit, the work by Chris Castel, but then focusing on the upper stratum, if you will.

1618
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:46,360
We looked at cultural patronage activities, which is basically a method to identify people

1619
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:52,160
doing a lot of money or they think about themselves as being distinct by consuming the

1620
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:56,160
high-end cultural activity. So we basically went to La Monde,

1621
02:08:56,160 --> 02:09:00,160
Chapel,

1622
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:10,160
but it's again, Eliza Betz, it is a bit. So you have all kinds of high-brow cultural activities

1623
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:15,160
and Brussels. They've been played. We also went to Buzza, which tried to identify,

1624
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:21,160
who is actually on the big friend list, who is sponsoring this high-end cultural

1625
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:23,400
and cultural institutions.

1626
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:27,320
I mean, these are not kind of super spectacular.

1627
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:29,280
- I think sometimes we find it's kind of,

1628
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:30,680
it become a big fan of Bazaar.

1629
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:34,120
I think it was 12,500 euros per year.

1630
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:36,200
So it's not kind of just,

1631
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:37,520
but it's not the same time,

1632
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:40,360
it's not something that you could spend

1633
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,560
on a normal salary.

1634
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:45,600
So you, that was kind of used as a kind of criterion

1635
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:48,800
to kind of find a group that has both,

1636
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,120
you could say cultural capital.

1637
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:56,080
also economic. What we found then is that another is actually quite interesting that to

1638
02:09:56,080 --> 02:10:01,600
these kind of methods you could actually identify the grid, these people live. We actually

1639
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:10,800
in Buzz and I took our bikes and then the pictures that were actually at the port level and

1640
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:15,760
then the firework where the leads were living. We find kind of interesting clustering there

1641
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:22,720
and it's all very much concentrated in actually in the city neighborhood. So most of the kind of

1642
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:31,520
roads led to this kind of area of the east, Breckman and those kind of areas. So we identified

1643
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:38,560
that our leads are very urban, if you will, and the other place was kind of more suburban,

1644
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:45,600
still within the Russell's capital region with Spipula, which is more like a Vulong neighborhood,

1645
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:50,600
But, and that's kind of distinct way of life.

1646
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:53,480
But it's kind of interesting that the major,

1647
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:57,040
say segregation process that you find in terms of

1648
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:59,840
gave it communities and those kind of things,

1649
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:03,640
this is not something that you easily find in Brussels.

1650
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:06,880
These things exist in Brussels, but it's not,

1651
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:11,880
yeah, it's not the Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro

1652
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:12,720
or these kind of things.

1653
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:17,720
It's really happening by micro mechanisms at the plot level

1654
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:21,360
that this kind of segregation is going on.

1655
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:25,920
Now, just those were just a few examples

1656
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:30,440
to take into account histories of spatial structure

1657
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:32,120
that name matter.

1658
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:35,280
Now, drawing it to a close, I think what I want to say

1659
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:38,480
is that, yeah, how to explain,

1660
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,940
You can say inequality polarization, et cetera,

1661
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:44,300
I think we'll let that polarization

1662
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:47,840
is just one way of one outcome of this process

1663
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,740
is we need some kind of analytical or explanatory model

1664
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:53,140
for that.

1665
02:11:53,140 --> 02:11:56,900
And I want to draw on the work that must be here.

1666
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:58,380
For fun, it's still quite interesting,

1667
02:11:58,380 --> 02:12:00,900
because they work in kind of three ways.

1668
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:03,660
It's like, look, there's at the macro level,

1669
02:12:03,660 --> 02:12:05,180
a level of global change.

1670
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:07,580
The economy in general, as we structure,

1671
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:12,580
could be financializing this new international division of labor, etc.

1672
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:14,580
So that's happening at the macro level.

1673
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:20,580
There's also at the individual level, due to personal characteristics, choices, etc.

1674
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:26,580
Veterans have its sculptures. You may have different kinds of labor market opportunities.

1675
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:34,580
There's a lot of noise there. It's hard to study in a systematic way, but we need to acknowledge that.

1676
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:41,620
But what is kind of interesting is how the macro and the micro kind of connected by this medium level level of analysis

1677
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:46,360
Because it's kind of the interface between global process and local process

1678
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:48,420
So we can think about how

1679
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:52,120
nicity, gender and those kind of things will structure

1680
02:12:52,120 --> 02:12:58,740
Access to the labor market and positionality in the labor market as that labor market is being structured

1681
02:12:58,740 --> 02:13:01,500
You have to acknowledge national differences

1682
02:13:02,620 --> 02:13:06,020
We talked about the rise of new liberalization.

1683
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:09,540
It hasn't materialized in the same way

1684
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:12,420
or at the same time in different kind of spaces.

1685
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:14,820
There's a large difference still between more,

1686
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:19,620
it's a social democratic or at least

1687
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:23,220
light versions of social democracy.

1688
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:29,420
Winston Continental Europe compared to the UK or the US.

1689
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:39,420
So in continental Europe in many places, there's still white, solid social security system,

1690
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:41,420
minimum wages, etc.

1691
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:46,540
And we kind of identified these are crucial elements in explaining

1692
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:52,420
product for Florida. Oh my god, proof of prioritization is getting laid.

1693
02:13:52,420 --> 02:13:57,420
So if you have these kind of security measures in place,

1694
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:04,140
will immediately kind of present at least in formal markets that you have an explosion at the bottom.

1695
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:11,260
So yeah that's something to take into account and also clearly even with a national context

1696
02:14:11,260 --> 02:14:15,020
you need to look at the functions and that's connecting back to the new party.

1697
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:20,220
Cities have different kind of functions and that will also shape its trajectory.

1698
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:27,260
If you look at city like Detroit or Charlotte Wab, it's not so likely that these places

1699
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:34,460
role now become leading global command and control centers, okay? Because they don't simply

1700
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:42,540
don't have that economic trajectory. So that's something this positionality in global economic

1701
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:50,140
systems has also been taken into account. Including then I think, yeah, the future, how would it look

1702
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:57,260
like. This kind of freemeling here but it's kind of lightly and you see in the

1703
02:14:57,260 --> 02:15:03,820
kind of current developments in cities also a mid-COVID is that it's very likely

1704
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:10,940
that these growing inequalities are only going to increase according to me. You see that

1705
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:19,180
austerity has been sent around in kind of forced. There's a lot of intervention linked to

1706
02:15:19,180 --> 02:15:22,180
We call it, there's again a discuss of a strong state.

1707
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:29,180
But as you saw that, you immediately have a lot of official documents that it had to be temporary.

1708
02:15:29,180 --> 02:15:34,180
And now you see a return to a kind of discourse that there will be again,

1709
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:37,180
but it's got to be made, so it's a coincidence.

1710
02:15:37,180 --> 02:15:42,180
And flounders, we are preparing the ditching from the ditching jump.

1711
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:45,180
So our education is to go digital.

1712
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:50,180
But at the same time, we have to have a budget of 100 million euros.

1713
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:54,180
So, okay, how do you marry those two?

1714
02:15:54,180 --> 02:15:58,180
I mean, for sure, those ways to become more efficient,

1715
02:15:58,180 --> 02:16:01,180
but at the same time, it's not really credible.

1716
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:09,180
So, nothing really has changed, I think, in this mark-to-narrative of austerity.

1717
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:11,180
So, that's kind of continuing.

1718
02:16:11,180 --> 02:16:15,740
And you can say the flexibilization of the labor market.

1719
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:18,940
It's still also progressing.

1720
02:16:18,940 --> 02:16:23,540
Okay. It will be different in different kind of contexts,

1721
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:26,940
but it's not really going away.

1722
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:30,140
Migration, as you know,

1723
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:35,500
and this is linked obviously to wider issues such as

1724
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,740
global change,

1725
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:43,140
will simply be more people that will have to rely on migration to still make a living.

1726
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:50,140
Rish also means in a lot of cities if you don't work on social security, minimum agents, etc.

1727
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:56,220
You won't do anything about the whole discussion about reserve army of labour.

1728
02:16:56,220 --> 02:17:02,020
So these conditions for exploitation will remain in place.

1729
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:06,060
So that's kind of working at a bottom-end, if you will,

1730
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:13,700
At the same time at the top end, and it's kind of returning a little bit to the whole discussion about income distribution to very start.

1731
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:20,700
We see that there's some kind of return of the Gilded Age as the Thomas Piketty calls it.

1732
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:28,700
So a period in the 20th century where, in the 19th century, sorry, where a lot of,

1733
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:35,460
You could say personal trajectories will kind of shape their way where you already come from.

1734
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:39,900
So it's a form of patrimonial capitalism where it matters more,

1735
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:44,700
who your parents are, than what you do in terms of,

1736
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:50,300
I choose this profession or that profession, I work to choose to work hard, etc.

1737
02:17:50,300 --> 02:18:01,700
And that means that an increasing part of the wealth is not based on income,

1738
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:06,300
but it's based on other sources of return on assets.

1739
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:13,000
So you see that a lot of groups, when you talk about the 1% of the 0.1%,

1740
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:16,600
their income is not an iteration of labor,

1741
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:20,600
but holding shares, bonds, etc.

1742
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:30,600
So this kind of explains why people that depend on an income from labor,

1743
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:33,600
if there's no real wage increases,

1744
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:39,600
well, you lose out on people that are basically representing capital that are shareholders,

1745
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:42,600
that kind of runs away.

1746
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:50,280
this kind of research by by picked a looking at to the share of the 0.1 so not the 1% but the 0.1%

1747
02:18:50,280 --> 02:19:01,480
in the United States Britain, Canada and Australia. We're back in the US at the 0.1 owning 7% of

1748
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:12,200
income, right? So 0.1% of all income in the US. So it's just just try to imagine what that means.

1749
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:20,720
So, and it's an every time you see economic growth and if it's not automatically translated

1750
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:26,240
into an increase in wages, which is obviously a whole bargaining process, you see that

1751
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:31,600
the return on capital increases and that it runs away from real income.

1752
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:37,360
And I think that will be the main discussion, I think, and the post-war era, what you

1753
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:43,080
had, for instance, the US is extremely progressive taxation. The higher incomes were

1754
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:50,000
was taxation of 2.70%. I was considered normal. What you see now in multiple

1755
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,920
presidency, for instance, in the US in the US has been relaxed.

1756
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:59,280
So now counter-tenancies, I would say, corporate taxation as a holder

1757
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:04,040
debate about that, or what extent we need to kind of increase that or standardize

1758
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:10,440
that is the kind of multi-level chess game which will be hard to realize but at

1759
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:16,680
least some things are going on there. So I think at the top end I think I mean if

1760
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:21,640
all goes normal there's no social upheaval I think this trend will just

1761
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:27,320
continue and the question is to what extent? To when is this socially feasible to

1762
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:31,160
keep things together or really to really pull apart and political another kind of

1763
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:35,660
I mean you think about cities and then as the final point it means that this

1764
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:40,560
function of cities is becoming transformed as well and maybe this links a

1765
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:44,640
little bit to what that question was just talking about last week is that cities

1766
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:52,520
become basically safety deposit boxes for those people that rely in wealth. You

1767
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:56,680
can think about absentee, baptism, and loneliness, all kinds of neighborhoods

1768
02:20:56,680 --> 02:21:03,080
that are owned, for instance, by people from the Arab Persian Gulf that don't live in London,

1769
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:10,040
but just yeah, they don't even bother to rent out parts of night bits or Chelsea because they

1770
02:21:10,040 --> 02:21:16,120
don't care because their value of these properties just increases so much that it's irrelevant

1771
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:22,440
whether you rent it out. Another example is shell companies in Manhattan and the Time Water Center

1772
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:30,760
average 30 million for apartments. I think 80% of this case is bought by shell companies,

1773
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:35,480
which is basically trusts within the trust within the trust or whatever. So it's somewhere

1774
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:41,160
the Cayman Islands of the new that trusts that buys these properties, but you never really know

1775
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:47,800
who's behind the shell company. So it's a way to for which individuals and corporations

1776
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:52,600
is the way to do the same property.

1777
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:57,480
You maintain the value of those assets to store their wealth

1778
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:59,160
in places.

1779
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:03,120
And yeah, to add on the final point,

1780
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:06,840
it means that the function of cities is being

1781
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:12,920
done support as holders of value, primarily,

1782
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:17,280
and according to SARS-CoS and the debt, I conclude.

1783
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:24,360
And as a real danger that the process of deprovenization is taking place in these leading

1784
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:26,880
world and global cities.

1785
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:30,160
And the case of absence of an terrorism is a good one.

1786
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:32,160
There's absolutely no life.

1787
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:33,160
Nobody is living there.

1788
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:41,040
It's a kind of pure financial asset or it's an empty tower block where nobody lives.

1789
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:46,840
And it seems to be a very big contradiction because when you think about bustling, bustling

1790
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:48,840
world and global cities.

1791
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:52,840
There's a lot of innovation and diversity, etc.

1792
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:54,840
These are empty shells.

1793
02:22:54,840 --> 02:23:01,840
They're at the store, the value and the wealth of very, very, very, very rich people.

1794
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:06,840
And I think it's an issue that we should reflect on.

1795
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:10,840
Okay, thank you.

1796
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:13,840
Thank you.

1797
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,840
I hope it was not too depressing.

1798
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:20,840
Or maybe that it is depressing and that we do something about it.

1799
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:22,840
on it? Um...

1800
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:25,260
(mumbling)

1801
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:27,760
(chuckles)
