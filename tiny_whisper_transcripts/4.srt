00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
[Music]

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,200
I don't know whether there's, I see some people with a laptop,

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,120
which you mind to check whether the webcast is working.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,360
Could you click on the link of the link of the live stream?

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,880
I think it should be, it should be working I think.

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,880
um...

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,880
[inaudible]

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,880
So, I'm very glad I'm trying to try to do anything.

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:23,880
[inaudible]

10
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,880
And I think that some of you might know me, and many others might not show me.

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:41,060
I am the excurable of these, these class, and the next one, in a trajectory-urban social

12
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,060
geography.

13
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,480
And I consider myself to be as our own social geographer, so that's a good thing I think.

14
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:57,520
Most of my research has dealt with migration, newcomers in the city, segregation, whiteness.

15
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,000
I've done a PhD with case studies and plumbers in South Africa,

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,160
so many years in Cape Town. I've studied how white-milliplast people move through the city.

17
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,840
Now, what's kind of people they get to meet in the city,

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,160
etc. So I've done some work on the geographies of encounter, the geographies of migration.

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:32,000
And this year I have decided to work less at the university and to spend more time with my

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,200
kids and more time on my bike. I like to cycle. And so it means that I have reduced my workload

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,600
at the university. I still have a 50% teaching assignment. I teach social geography in the first

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,920
year, Bachelor of Geography. I teach some classes in urban geography. I also take the students

23
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,440
on a field trip to Estonia. This will be the geographers this year. I've also done that for the

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,600
master in urban study students two years ago, was the last time I think we did it.

25
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,640
And I'm teaching a course on the city and migration that's a title at the University of

26
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,800
to move. So I have quite some teaching assignments, also supervising some master's thesis

27
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:27,640
to PhD thesis. So that's what I'm what I'm doing. I've written here in my presenter,

28
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:37,480
through M.I. and I'm another white male, mid-aged, middle-class man that you get to see here.

29
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,560
I think this issue of positionality is also an important one, especially in the kind

30
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,560
issues that I will discuss when it comes to diversity, when it comes to migration, whether

31
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,400
my experience is in the city. And so I think that's also something important to point at

32
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,400
and something that we could discuss also further in a semester like whether this is something

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,120
important or not to you. But there will be not so much time for discussion today. There will be

34
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,440
time for discussion in the seminars and that will come soon and there will also be time for

35
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,960
discussion on the field trips. I'm going to run through two field trips for the students.

36
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:25,000
This is for the four cities and the master of urban studies students so not for all the

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,880
other ones. But we have one excursion to Antwerp and one excursion to Shaldrwa next week

38
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,360
that I'm going to run.

39
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,400
And so I wanted to share some practicalities.

40
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,520
And I don't like the fact that I'm somehow bound to my laptop,

41
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
but this is for the live stream.

42
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,160
So let's say, I hope that it's working now.

43
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,080
But so first of all, next week, Tuesday,

44
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,760
I think 40 of you have signed up to go to Antwerp.

45
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,400
Is that correct?

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,240
Who will join me to Antwerp?

47
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,920
Yeah.

48
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,080
I will hand out some excursion guides.

49
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,360
I bridge a ton in color by accident.

50
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,040
I don't know how happy the department

51
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,000
will be about that.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,960
(laughs)

53
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,160
If you get these paper copies in full color,

54
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,440
so you can take one if you join me.

55
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,200
Don't take one if you don't join me

56
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,440
because then I will not have enough copies from everyone.

57
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,520
And what is important, and that's something else

58
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,200
that I want to hand out,

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,600
is that I'm living in Antwerp,

60
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,600
and so I will meet you in Antwerp railway station.

61
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,760
Great.

62
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,800
To be in one wallet.

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,840
Who is joining to Antwerp,

64
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,840
and is familiar with this rail pass or go pass?

65
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,680
No one?

66
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,760
Yeah, some people.

67
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,760
So I would agree to you and I would like you for all the people that joined.

68
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
I'm going to bring it online.

69
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,760
And so it says, this is a French.

70
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,760
You can also fill it in Dutch Corimiglish.

71
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,760
The day, Tuesday, the dates in the Belgian system with the month here,

72
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,760
then the place in America, beef that will be Brussels.

73
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,760
and then and you need lines for everyone.

74
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,640
It's a bit complicated because you have tickets for those under 26 and other

75
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,760
tickets for those over 26. A bit more expensive.

76
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,760
So I'll give them to you.

77
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,760
>> That means that you are responsible for that.

78
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
>> That's good.

79
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,760
>> That means that you are responsible for that.

80
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
>> Yeah.

81
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
>> That's good.

82
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
>> That's good.

83
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
>> Yeah.

84
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
>> It's good.

85
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
>> It's good.

86
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
>> Yeah.

87
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
>> I think it's good.

88
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
>> I think it's good.

89
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
>> Yeah.

90
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
>> I think it's good.

91
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
>> I think it's good.

92
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
>> All right.

93
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:25,880
So it's important that you meet on time, the 22/8 next week Tuesday we are leaving

94
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:33,320
a rather early with a train that will have as a destination on Vericund, Nordr

95
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,560
bookum which is a small station to the north of Antwerp but it's important that you get off at

96
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,880
Antwerp in Central. Yeah so the group will meet 740 you take you make sure that you get on the

97
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:56,840
train 752 and then I and Louise will make sure together with all of you that you have a line for

98
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:04,680
each students, you get on the train and it will be platform 5 I guess if you're late you pay for

99
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,520
your own ticket. So use let's use that as an incentive. I will not reimburse anyone with these

100
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,080
late. You should travel with the group and then you all arrive at the same time according to the

101
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:25,960
schedule at 835 and I will meet you on the platform. Yeah so that's what we do. We will go cycling.

102
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:32,280
I hope that everyone was aware of that. It will, it is November, it will be cold, it will be wet.

103
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:39,560
So make sure that you bring some gloves and some rain gear because it might, it might be cold.

104
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,000
Bring the excursion guides, especially now that it has been printed in full color,

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,760
because we will use that quite a bit. And we are going to discuss basically the topics of the

106
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,920
this class and next class. So we will discuss segregation and social mix in the field in Antwerp.

107
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:05,400
We will get to cycle about 25 kilometers, that's quite a bit, but it has worked out every year.

108
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:14,280
Nicely so I trusted it will be the same. We're a mouth mask on the train. I don't know what the

109
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,040
regulations will say how we need to get around in enter. We are quite a big group. I might

110
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:28,440
split you up a couple of times and bring a lunch or buy one in enter. I will give you an hour

111
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,480
to have a lunch but we will be in quite a fancy part of time so it might be more complicated

112
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:42,360
to find a cheap place there but not impossible. So you will complete these rail bosses and go

113
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,320
bosses and then you will when you arrive in Enterp, you will give these two to me.

114
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,640
Next week, Friday, I will thank you to Charlotte Wop, or some of you who will join me to

115
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:03,720
Charlotte Wop. Okay, so a similar amount of people and we will meet in the Brussels railway

116
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,040
station, Central, so that's important. Ten minutes later, but still quite early, at 10 to

117
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:18,360
eight in order to be on the train at seven past eight. Yeah, again, the same system that say I will be

118
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,040
responsible for the rail passes and the go passes. If you're late, you will need to get in touch with

119
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,520
a fellow student to know where we are. I'm not going to wait for you at the train station in

120
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:35,320
shall the war, but also you need to pay your own ticket. Okay, and we're going to hike. First through

121
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,560
the city but we will also climb some of these at least one ash heap the riddle in French so this

122
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,840
small mountain of like leftover from the coal mining it is quite steep it can be wet so you should

123
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:58,760
also have some good shoes that allow you to to do that bring a pen and paper and I will bring

124
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,600
you a similar kind of excursion guide probably in black and white for the

125
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,480
shadow-gawah excursion and you can again bring a lunch or buy one in

126
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:17,560
shallow one. Do we have any practical questions about these trips? Yeah?

127
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,280
That's a good question. I think in shallow gawah I will end around five, meaning

128
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,720
you can get back to Brussels around six, but I have a habit to give you the possibility

129
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,240
either to get on a train back to Brussels, but I also suggest you to walk back to Shah

130
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:43,200
Leghua train station. But if you want, you can be back in Brussels at six. From Antwerp,

131
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,400
we will end at six the very latest, because that's the moment when I need to give back

132
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,120
the bikes to the biker until agency. And so that means that you should be able to be back

133
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:02,240
in Brussels at seven. Some other practical questions? No. And I'm looking yeah.

134
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:12,480
No you will get a helmet you will get a look. If you're very eager to take your own bike to

135
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,280
enter, you can do it on the train and it's a bit of a hassle but you will get a nice rental

136
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:24,280
you will get a helmet if you want and you will get a look for the bike as well.

137
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:30,280
So I will see you next week. I will see 40 of you.

138
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Next week, Tuesday in Antwerp Central Railway Station.

139
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I'm looking forward to that.

140
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,280
So these are the practicalities about the excursions.

141
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
I'm glad that I was able to share that

142
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,280
and personally rather than just another message in the town of us.

143
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,280
And today you're not in session one.

144
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
You're in session four.

145
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
You had an introductory class.

146
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,280
You had two classes on world city formation and polarization

147
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
in world global cities.

148
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,280
And basically today we will continue with it on the theme of

149
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,280
class three and I will we will discuss segregation.

150
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:18,160
We will discuss patterns of segregation and we will discuss causes of segregation and next week

151
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,240
I will discuss effects or consequences of segregation. So these are two classes that fit

152
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,800
very well together and there is a clear theme for each of them patterns causes of segregation

153
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:40,000
today. Effects consequences of segregation next week. I assume that all of you have read

154
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:47,840
these two texts. Have you maybe we can also have a look? Who has read these two texts?

155
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:55,040
Yeah, you can be proud about it. Who has not been able to read these two texts? You can also be

156
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,160
proud about that. Okay, so I see that more people have not read it, not read them rather than read them.

157
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:10,400
For the discussion seminar, I think it's important that we have like a shared knowledge and these

158
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,680
two texts for this week and the two texts for next week will be the shared knowledge together with

159
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,200
what is being shared in the class. So I hope that all of you will be able to read these two texts

160
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,840
and the two for next week by the time we have the discussion. So

161
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:37,920
and okay today I have basically three topics. I will discuss first these classical models of urban

162
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,760
form in the text by Pat surely, which was a textbook chapter.

163
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,880
There was a reference to Bergus.

164
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,360
I'm going to talk about Hoyt.

165
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,640
I'm going to talk about Harrison Omen.

166
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,840
Some classical models of urban form

167
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,080
that have been generated by Chicago School Scholars

168
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,480
in the beginning of the 20th century.

169
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,600
Then secondly, I'm going to discuss patterns of segregation,

170
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,760
meaning that we will discuss how to measure segregation

171
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,120
and how you can look at segregation

172
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,760
from different angles. And then at the end of the class, I will discuss some

173
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:19,280
courses or segregation. Why is it that people live in different neighborhoods of the city?

174
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,600
Why is it that you can find white people in one part of town and people of Black African origin

175
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:33,920
in another part of town? So this is the topic list for today. And I'm going to start with this

176
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:45,040
classic a land use model by Bergus. So those of you who have read the textbook chapter by Patchoni

177
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:53,840
have been reading about the Bergus. He was writing from Chicago in 1925. I think that's important.

178
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,240
I will do the live stream like this. I think that might also still work. It's everyone able to

179
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
to give you as a back here.

180
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

181
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,320
Okay, so that's going around the world.

182
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,560
So what was Bergus doing here is trying to understand

183
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,840
how cities were looking like?

184
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,320
And what kind of groups of people

185
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,120
that could find in different parts of the system?

186
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,480
And you were stating that basically you had five

187
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
concentric rings,

188
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,160
the heart of the city that was the loop,

189
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,640
loop I will discuss that later it's a term from Chicago basically the central business district.

190
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,440
Around that you have to assume a transition that's how it involved it and around in the

191
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:48,040
queer zone of working, working, math schools. There is a residential zone, a suburban and another

192
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:56,120
residential zone which is called the community. So five rings around the city. And why was it

193
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,880
and that you have these five rings, well,

194
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,040
because different functions in the city

195
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,200
and different groups of people

196
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,880
were able to pay different rents in the city.

197
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,880
So the theory was that in the center of the city,

198
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,920
the center of this district,

199
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,520
you found, for example, the headquarters of an office,

200
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,480
because they were able to pay the higher rents

201
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,880
that you had so close to the city center.

202
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,240
And third in our main property, that was the theory.

203
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:40,240
You would find, for example, suburban boats, not very dense,

204
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,000
because these people were able to spend too many less

205
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,120
of rent for their part of the forest.

206
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,280
And so this bit of rent theory was basically

207
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,160
underlying this novel of concentric links on the city.

208
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Yes?

209
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,480
The term model can be a little bit confusing.

210
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
And because it could give you the impression

211
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,040
that this is an ideal type like this is how we sit for poop.

212
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,760
But Virgus was trying to do, but basically

213
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,920
to simplify reality and to understand our city's

214
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,200
spur, not necessarily how they open it.

215
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,240
How our cities, and we try to simplify it.

216
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,040
and that's how a simplified version of Chicago

217
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,800
of Western cities looks like.

218
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,280
I told you already written in 1925

219
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,840
and that's very important.

220
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Why?

221
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,320
Because we are at a moment in time,

222
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,320
this is the population of Chicago from 1840 to 2014,

223
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,760
We are at a moment in time 1925,

224
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,240
when this population of Chicago has been growing through

225
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,240
an exponential growth for many, many years.

226
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,720
Yeah, and that also explains why

227
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,000
tourists was making a model of the growth of the city.

228
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,760
Yeah, it's not a model of any city.

229
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,520
It's the model of a growing city,

230
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,480
and you tries to understand

231
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,600
how this growth of the city grows.

232
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,360
both in terms of a growing population,

233
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,200
but also a city that is characterized

234
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,440
by an expanding area.

235
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,160
This built-in environment is grown.

236
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,920
And so it's a level of the growth of the city.

237
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,440
And writing from Chicago in 1925,

238
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,000
well, this is a very particular growing city,

239
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,160
this is a city of immigration, but all of immigrants

240
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,160
from all over the world, but from Europe, in particular initially,

241
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,160
arrived in a very nice settle.

242
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,160
And then you see that in 1900, you have less than 2 million people,

243
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,160
and you need to go only 10, 15 years later

244
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
to the five Mother-Mimics people

245
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
have to the population.

246
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,160
So this is a fast growing city,

247
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,160
both in terms of population and in terms of the area that is built up.

248
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,160
That's also expanding. That's also true.

249
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:28,160
It's also a city that is characterized by a Virginia population.

250
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,160
So what you see here is the result of a survey going from house to house,

251
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,320
One thing of people's door and then checking whether there is someone English speaking in white

252
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:48,400
Irish in green German in purple Dutch in dog furbled Russian in red etc

253
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,940
And so you see that this city was characterized by

254
00:20:51,940 --> 00:21:00,240
Energy in this document all these people coming from different countries for origin arriving in Chicago at that time

255
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,940
So it's a particular city that

256
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,880
Burvis is writing from and I'm saying that because I want to argue that

257
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,720
This theory that

258
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:17,300
Burvis made up and which he thought was universal for growing cities was in fact a

259
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,560
Theory that was mostly applicable to Chicago

260
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,640
So here you see a couple of assumptions which are also mentioned

261
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,900
in the text that you read or that you're going to read,

262
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,580
the assumptions and principles that were underlying

263
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,580
this theory of the model of the growing city,

264
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,740
the growth of the city.

265
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,940
So you see that the assumption is that there

266
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,260
is this cultural and social effort

267
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,500
to eat off the population.

268
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,580
You can also think of other cities and countries

269
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,020
which are less marked by this kind of diversity.

270
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,620
The second assumption is that there is a commercial industrial

271
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,580
based to the economy of the city,

272
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,580
which you think of other bases to the economy of the city.

273
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,820
What kind of other bases could you have

274
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,900
rather than commercial best show?

275
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,580
- Right.

276
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,060
In the horizon, if you go to a city,

277
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,460
that is marked by tourism,

278
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,140
and for example, each stream

279
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,780
could be of any important place.

280
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,460
And a while in a commercial industrial city,

281
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,660
it's in the political center of business districts.

282
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,660
The center of the city is dominated by a touristic place.

283
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,820
Well, many of you would get different time.

284
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,060
I have also saw other time.

285
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,580
as a member of the UN at the other side.

286
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,420
See, find it.

287
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:59,860
Everything's based, yeah, when you were getting a heritage.

288
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,260
I could also imagine like cities that draw a lot of

289
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,300
deliveries, a religious basis to the city of

290
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,260
Temple or church would be central places.

291
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,660
So you can take off other kinds of cities.

292
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,340
And then the idea of burgers would be that this model

293
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,400
of the group, personal warfare.

294
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,500
Right, ownership or property, economic competition for space,

295
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
you can imagine other cities in the Soviet Union,

296
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,020
for example, land and economy, different kind of cities.

297
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,900
And for expanding area and population of the city,

298
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:41,340
many cities in Europe are nowadays marked by shrinkage.

299
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:49,780
in eastern Germany, for example, Genova in the thinkability city that has been

300
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:56,220
marked by Shriepitrofennial on top. Detroit, that will sit in both America, but

301
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,740
that's gone through a similar.

302
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:05,020
Fifth assumption, transport is equally easy, easy rapid and cheap in every

303
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,620
direction within the city. It's hard to imagine how that would ever be

304
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,860
possible because you will always have transport infrastructure that will allow you to move from one end of the city

305
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:23,860
which more quickly to another end and to another part of the city. Number five the city center is the main

306
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:30,500
center for employment and therefore more studyable. You'll also think many other kinds of city

307
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,460
you have for example the airport is an important help and you have a leak and

308
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,380
big developments for rockets. So these things are more attractive because of

309
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,100
differences in terrain. I told you I did my PGD on Cape Town you've got the

310
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,260
Atlantic Ocean you've got table mounted. You can imagine that these differences

311
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:56,780
in terrain are very important to understand how this city is formed. You have no

312
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:02,740
concentrations of heavy industry. Yeah, and you have no historic survival of an

313
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:09,620
burial and your spatter in any district. There is no heritage to you have 19th

314
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:16,540
century housing or a medieval harvest city. And so, Virgis himself already

315
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:21,860
acknowledged that it's our techniques to be added, I'm quoting there, that neither

316
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:28,580
Shikago, nor any other city fits perfectly into this ideal scheme.

317
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,460
Complications in Shikago are introduced by the lake front,

318
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,380
but a lake in Shikago.

319
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,420
And so there is a difference in Shikago River,

320
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,220
another difference in the rain.

321
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,620
Railroad lines, which mean that the transport is not equally

322
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,660
seen rather cheap in every direction.

323
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,600
and historical factors in the location of industry,

324
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,820
in which might mean that you have concentrations of heavy industry,

325
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,660
some parts of the city.

326
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,360
Et cetera.

327
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,660
So you see the acknowledgement that,

328
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,900
well, I'm trying to formulate

329
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,620
a universal model of urban growth,

330
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:17,420
but underlying my theory are a lot of assumptions and principles,

331
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,180
which make that basically unwriting,

332
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,180
I'm writing up a model of a specific city.

333
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:30,180
Chicago and basically my model was called for Chicago.

334
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
There's not even both for Chicago itself,

335
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,180
because there are many congregations.

336
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:41,180
I will discuss this further in a bit like.

337
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:48,180
In urban studies we have been going through a moment where we started to realize

338
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,300
many of our theories are provincial. When we write about gentrification and we make

339
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:59,780
theory of gentrification, then if we make a case on Brussels then we write a very Western kind of

340
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:06,820
perspective on gentrification. So it's necessary to deprovinsulize our theories. I find it

341
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:13,060
interesting that already 100 years ago there was this awareness that, well, me, Burguz, I'm writing

342
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,060
from Chicago and this is important to understand.

343
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,060
So how did this model look like?

344
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:25,060
I will run through this central central,

345
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,060
most central,

346
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,060
concentric ring is the loop.

347
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,060
Why the loop?

348
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,060
If you ever winch the ideal,

349
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,060
you focus metro lines that all converge in the city

350
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,060
and where basically this whole metro is making a loop

351
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:55,060
taking back the line from where it's going. So you have these elevators metal track, in a loop, in the shape of a loop. And so that's why the central business is the kind of scope.

352
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:10,060
So this is the place where you have shopping, where you have offices, where you have headquarters, companies where you expect to find theaters and etc.

353
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:18,060
etc. Because these are the functions that are able to pay the highest rent, the highest price

354
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,860
for the central one pitch. Why do they want to be in the central location? Well, these are all

355
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:31,740
functions that need to draw office workers, shoppers, de-entergoers from all corners of the city.

356
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:39,500
And so for them, it is important to be in the central location that is easy to reach from

357
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:50,540
everywhere in this. So they want to be in the room. She got on 1925 pictured the

358
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:59,500
media on IP, busy streets, the first skyscrapers of the world in the city, earlier than New York,

359
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:06,300
and so we have basically the first city where you have this, I'm just saying that like this

360
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,620
the classical central business district

361
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,980
from the North American town city.

362
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,980
So, so soon, one, the central business district.

363
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,300
Around this, you have the zone,

364
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,460
in transition, the zone of transition.

365
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:30,820
Basically what you find there is factories.

366
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,980
Why do these factories want to be located there?

367
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:41,420
They also rely on labor that needs to come in by a trend, by a metro, etc.

368
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:48,820
So they also want to be in a central location that allows them to bring in workers from all corners of this.

369
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:56,780
But they are not able to pay these high prices for length, that these functions on the previous slides were able to work.

370
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:03,860
So we will find a second to bring in which you have these factors.

371
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,860
Not only factories, you also find neighborhoods there.

372
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,840
Who wants to live close to these factories?

373
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
Nobody.

374
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,800
This is very poor, you took this very dirty.

375
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,720
These are very bad living services.

376
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,760
So who ends up here?

377
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,640
The first generation of immigrants

378
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,160
from different countries of origin.

379
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,600
Yeah, and as soon as these people are able to force

380
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,600
move to a better part of town than they will do so.

381
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,600
These names that you find on the pictures, little hell,

382
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
those quite a bit.

383
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
But also the fact that, for example,

384
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
here you have little Sicily,

385
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,600
so this is a part of town where this Sicilian is derived.

386
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,600
That was formerly little Sweden.

387
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:05,200
So you see how one group of newcomers moves out and is followed by a new group of people

388
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,000
from another country of origin.

389
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,400
That was what Berghis was noticing in 1925.

390
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:17,600
And so this is the part of the Chicago, close to the central business district, close

391
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:26,080
to do, in the middle of all these factories, where people who just landed off the boat

392
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,960
from Europe and Iraq. And so you have some secret groups, and these are these of new commerce

393
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:42,720
school Iraq. People who have been able to climb the social ladder, they will move out of these areas.

394
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:54,520
And they are able to afford a better home, further away from these factories, and they are also able to afford the commutge between home and the world.

395
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,520
So there's also a price to be paid for this.

396
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,520
So, verbus is writing there about the zone of independent European France, who's dead.

397
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,520
And in his vocabulary, respectable working class is living there.

398
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:24,520
So I found it interesting that I hear six miles northwest of the loop, more west.

399
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,520
So we are moving in that direction about 10 kilometers out of the loop.

400
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,520
You also had an area of Chicago that the family had quite some Belgians living.

401
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,640
And Berghis was also writing about the Belgians.

402
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,320
Many of them were geniters.

403
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,160
So they also had like a specific profession

404
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,520
that many of them were home forms.

405
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,200
And they also had a colloquine.

406
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,240
So you see here, 1921, whole Belgians are equal.

407
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,200
They built a colloquine for Belgians.

408
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Celebrating Belgian-based and Belgian traditions,

409
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:14,200
We have a St. John Burickman's church, Cynthia and Bechmans in Chicago, and so after the day you can visit the neighborhood that was marked by a Belgian son of the post.

410
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,840
Empathy also has neighborhoods where you had many German or many Russians for many Italians

411
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,760
who had been able to find this social weather and who had been able to out with further

412
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,000
away from these effectiveness.

413
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,840
I have also shown you this map of the survey going door to door.

414
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,440
There was a lot of heterogeneity even in streets that some neighborhoods were also marked

415
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,400
by these ethnic groups.

416
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,560
And then as you go further away from the loop,

417
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,920
you get to more suburban, less dense developments.

418
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,840
Here you see the neighborhood of Mount Prospects.

419
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,480
About 25 miles more west from the loop.

420
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,240
And so we are moving about 40 kilometers out of the loop.

421
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,600
Now 30 to 60 minutes commute to the loop by train.

422
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,040
And so the moment that these trains are being trained lines are being filled,

423
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,960
you see these kinds of suburban developments.

424
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,720
And then you see my prospects 1917.

425
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,760
This is a K-trick of my memory, the 50th.

426
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,880
And this was the ring of the day.

427
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,160
But you also see who is living there,

428
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,160
on the twist, 3D shadowies who have arrived quite early

429
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,120
and were contained like a flying this source of color,

430
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,200
and we'll arrive a little bit on Sweden,

431
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
but then we'll move to the so-and-well,

432
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,000
respectable working and its homes as very as common,

433
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,680
but we'll be able to, as they climb to the social weather,

434
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
we'll also be able to,

435
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,320
to these suburban developments in bringing forward.

436
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,960
- So I have a question about the French private,

437
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,480
and it seems like all of the stuff,

438
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,560
the city of France, but the craftsman,

439
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,320
like it seems like the party is important,

440
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
it seems like the French is too.

441
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
- I'm sorry.

442
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,360
How do you feel that they're rent?

443
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
They're a part of it.

444
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,760
Is it revenue, how do you work?

445
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,800
I think the part they have.

446
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,880
Yeah, but you need to see it rent for like you need to pay $12 per stream.

447
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,240
Yeah, and so closer you get to the city center,

448
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,720
the tensor is developed.

449
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,920
We saw it.

450
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,760
And so for that reason, it's not about like what you can't

451
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,080
afford, but how much you are willing to pay per stream.

452
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,680
And so these developments closer to the center are much more dense.

453
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,760
And so that explains why this bitter and poor

454
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,800
is still going down.

455
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Now, yeah.

456
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:57,920
Virgus, so the concentric zone model.

457
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,760
And a theory that is still being used--

458
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,160
but even today, if you read about newcomers in cities

459
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,400
and neighborhoods of arrival, and people still refer to tourists,

460
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,880
maybe conceptualized.

461
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,160
This arrival of newcomers in Chicago,

462
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,120
and the kind of neighborhoods that they were going through,

463
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,760
as they climbed the social networks.

464
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:29,400
But you also have other models.

465
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,120
I'm still, before the second world war,

466
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:41,760
and points another researcher who studied 142 American cities and who stated in the beginning

467
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,200
of his paper that so far reaching are the changes in our population pattern and social

468
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,640
structure that it can well be asked whether theories of city growth and structure formulated

469
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,680
for the private enterprise economy of the late 90th and 20th centuries is now referring

470
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,420
to veriviously would be well be applicable in a future society that may be

471
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:14,760
of a fundamentally different nature. What happens between 1925 and 1939 in

472
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,160
America? What kind of changes would be so important that you just have an

473
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,400
impact on the model of the world?

474
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,780
Yeah, the depression.

475
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,300
So this is about crisis, a moment of economic crisis.

476
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,300
Yeah?

477
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:39,340
And when you look at, we'll go a couple of slides back.

478
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:48,180
Yeah, when you look at population growth and in Chicago,

479
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,580
then you see that this crisis, 1920 by the 1930s,

480
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:58,180
But this is a clear impact also on the population of shiitaj.

481
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,220
As people are eager to immigrate,

482
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,180
and to a country in crisis, the government

483
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,660
is also more strict on who can come, et cetera.

484
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,300
And so there is a big economic crisis that also

485
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,100
means that there is less migration related to less migration

486
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
to the states.

487
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,500
There are also other phenomena.

488
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,300
of white was writing itself, a new theory of civic grade growth made

489
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:30,500
necessary to fit the effects of a period when cities grow more slowly,

490
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:36,260
and that's what I told you already, but also when automobiles and airplanes

491
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:42,500
removed dependency on fixed rails, the car becomes much more important.

492
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:48,820
You can imagine that a city built for car drivers looks quite different from

493
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,820
city that is built for people to take a tram or a metro or a train.

494
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,820
And he also adds that what is also different is that there's more government control and fixation of high incomes

495
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,820
for the benefit of the poor. This is a graph that sells you something about

496
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,820
taxation of the top income rates in the states. And so you see that this has been going through

497
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,700
going through fights and changes. And as described as when America was hit by

498
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:26,060
prizes that there was an urge to do it, so we have more texts, more income texts,

499
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:32,620
these highest power that means is that government can also intervene more in-house

500
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:39,260
in-game infrastructure, et cetera, et cetera. And so a couple of changes that

501
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:46,140
is it we have been going through and so what is saying well these models made for cities of a

502
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:53,740
particular kind remember these assumptions of burgers to not hold true in the cities that I am

503
00:39:53,740 --> 00:40:02,540
studying in the 1930s this 104 cities because we see a lot of different kinds of processes

504
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,900
So, Hoyt came up with a sector of...

505
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,900
... At a sector of theory, saying that,

506
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,900
"Well, you still have this central business district in the city."

507
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,900
So, around this, you do not have a couple of concentric rings,

508
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
but you have sectors.

509
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,900
And the assumption is that when the city grows

510
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,900
at each of these sectors, a little growing,

511
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:39,460
And so if you have to the, in this case, to the east sector in which the richest people

512
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:44,260
are living, and the assumption is that when these group groups or the population from

513
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,500
the city grows, that this sector will also grow to the east.

514
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:56,780
And so you have a couple of different sectors, I class medium class, both class, which are

515
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:05,660
also organized by the transportation infrastructure. So you would have industry

516
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:13,020
factories concentrated along rivers, allows rain lines and roads. You may at the

517
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:18,380
next day that you would have both glass residential areas just like

518
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:24,060
burgers assumed. The burgers assumed that these factories and the lowest

519
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,060
world-class areas would be located in a concentric ring.

520
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,060
And Oric was saying, well, if you look at cities in the 30s in America,

521
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,060
and the sector model comes closer to reality.

522
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,060
So this is a better way to simplify how cities are looking.

523
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:48,060
So sectors rather than concentric rings,

524
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:52,060
what is also important is that there's much more emphasis on

525
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:59,660
and medium-class, low-class, high-class. While Virgus was often writing from these ethnic groups,

526
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:07,180
Italians, Sicilians, Germans, Russians, Swedish, and people arriving in the city.

527
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,260
And...

528
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:20,860
Okay, a third moment is the one by Harry's and all, and this is a garage for a

529
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:27,820
a picture that comes from their paper. We wrote now on the 19th or 25 and you see that in

530
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:33,900
their paper they make a reference already, just got sent to it. So mobile by burgers. They refer

531
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,980
to the sector theory by Boyd and then they come up with their phone mobile, just got

532
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:47,340
controlled people locally modeled of the city and you see in date that they have

533
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:52,620
this kind of jigsaw puzzle that represents the city for them in which you still

534
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:58,540
find number one essential business district and next to it and next to it

535
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:03,260
this trick would also a live manufacturing which you also see a couple other

536
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:08,620
notes that are important to understand the city for example seven and

537
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:16,940
outline business systems. So this is an important difference between these two models and that one.

538
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:24,220
There's not just one central business list which also has important business districts in other parts

539
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:33,260
of the city. For example in London and even in the history, there is an open state. You have this

540
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:39,980
economic hard of the city, of the city, close to the dollar bridge and you've got a political

541
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:45,260
heart of the city, close to the westerns there, there is a distance between us to, while

542
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:51,340
in this traditional bubble, you would expect them to be concentrated, close to each other

543
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:57,980
in this central business district. They also refer to Chicago, they say there are a couple of

544
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:05,740
industries or universities which are in very different parts of the city than this

545
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:12,140
burgers model, quite more, and expected. So then we refer to area of any industry

546
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:18,940
that I call it, close to the river in the lake. And then also this university of Chicago

547
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:26,780
for the south of the, which is then again like the hook of an area in which you find

548
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,780
of the military people, the university, the pictures, and people working at the university.

549
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,780
And part of the town where you would not expect that to.

550
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,660
And so they also look at his kind of spice in the big

551
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,780
witrant, saying that well, formerly according to Ferguson, this would always come

552
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:52,140
down by the further you get from the city center, the lower

553
00:44:52,140 --> 00:45:00,220
is bitter and occur with me. The lower the price per square meter that people of poor companies

554
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:06,300
or other pensions are willing to fake, but then Aristotle would say, well, you always find this kind

555
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:13,740
of low spice, for example, local shopping centers, not all the shopping is happening in the central

556
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:21,100
business district, so you can find these low-risk shopping centers or a satellite city and around which

557
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,980
you fight again like this, the increasing

558
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,020
and the threat force.

559
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,940
So the third model, head is an omen,

560
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:35,140
where you have multiple, nuclei, more than one center,

561
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,980
basically, and you get this kind of itself

562
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,380
was to simplify perfect force.

563
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,620
In this theory, they upon consider those 10

564
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,020
[INAUDIBLE]

565
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,620
Well, in that case, if that's the table,

566
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,100
they work.

567
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,740
Yeah, every city will have a different kind

568
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:02,180
of form of them in argument that these models are too simplistic.

569
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,780
And not everything is ready, anything from one center

570
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,580
with the practice you will always find, but then one.

571
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:14,340
So that's why reality looks more complex than in these minutes.

572
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,620
OK.

573
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:23,860
And why to go back to Chicago, why to go back to theory

574
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,100
that have been written 100 years ago?

575
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,380
I think it's interesting to make urban geographers

576
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:34,100
of people who are not studies, to make them think about the form

577
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,100
of a system and who is living where they are.

578
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,660
And so on the left, you have cleared a map of Chicago

579
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:49,940
nowadays and each dot basically represents one person to put the ultimate Detroit

580
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:57,300
ultimate report, finds maps for other American cities like that and so you see here that

581
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:04,340
basically the different colors on the back represent different people who self identify

582
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:12,260
with different racist slash ethnicities. So then making you find people self identify

583
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:19,180
and the climate is too wide in the year 20 then in blue we find people self-identify this

584
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:26,500
black in green people who self-identify this Asia and in orange people who self-identify

585
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,020
this Spanish.

586
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:36,260
In the American context, the race, the ethnicity corresponds very much with class.

587
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:54,260
And so if you would have a map with socio-economic classes, then you would also find that most of these neighborhoods, which turn out to be a big number of times, where you have a majority of people, so identified as white, so it would be the better of neighborhoods.

588
00:47:54,260 --> 00:48:02,260
And the neighborhoods, with people who self identified, black, could be underprivileged neighborhoods.

589
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:09,260
So now I question for you which of these models of urban form the concentric

590
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:16,260
remodel by Virgus, the sector level by wood where this multiple nuclei model

591
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:22,260
can you find on the mat.

592
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,260
It will not be a lot, so you can find elements of basically all three models

593
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:36,260
on the map. So when you look at this close, what do you see? Who sees that?

594
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:41,260
>> For now, when you see a question, it might be a question, but it's too sweet to be a find that's

595
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:48,260
right out. >> Mm-hm. You find these kind of sectors.

596
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:57,260
And indeed, I have the Metro Metro Chicago. This will be the central business district.

597
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:02,260
to have like pieces of pie that start from the central business.

598
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,380
So in the scratch of Chicago nowadays,

599
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,300
it's still looking like for it with a predicted

600
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,060
with these different sectors corresponding

601
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,180
with different population groups,

602
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,140
different socio-economic classes,

603
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,860
low-class, high-class, medium-class.

604
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,580
They use the vocabulary by, by point,

605
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,420
so in these, you can still find that there.

606
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:54,660
So, what is represented on the map? In these terms, it's considered to be relevant, but yes, so we still make that like also for some reason. We still find it important to do that. But when you look at the pattern.

607
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,660
So I would feel like more of a over-the-contestive

608
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,660
I would say our own focus is about it.

609
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:08,660
But that's just a bit of a fight.

610
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,660
From the airport, so indeed it's very hard to see

611
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:17,660
concentric sense, the ring one, because there will be very few

612
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,660
residents of the Central Business District.

613
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,660
It's also hard to spot concentric ring two.

614
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,660
It's also hard to spot some trickering three.

615
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,660
But then when you move further away from the city center,

616
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,660
it's a ring number of four and a ring number five,

617
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,660
where a bird is really expected to better off.

618
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,660
Residents who are blind to social better,

619
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,660
because still see that even today,

620
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,660
these are indeed the places where you find almost exclusively

621
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,660
white, dominated paper roots.

622
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,660
And so this is still the case.

623
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:56,660
That's what this ring number 4 and 5 are still there.

624
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,660
Every single woman is multiple, quickly.

625
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:07,660
[inaudible]

626
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:12,660
Yeah, you can define, so for example, to see an example,

627
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:42,560
example. It's like his neck, like running, posture, sound. I hear that. Yeah, let the rest of it. I do. I like it. There are two questions. Okay, so in the future I have a cluster of these, I think, people who sell identified as his colleague in the South. And that's around this, a caliber to river. In the street area.

628
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:52,120
Yeah, you also have a cluster of whites in a sector that is blue, that is dominated by

629
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,960
people who are so identified as black.

630
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,840
And this is this university of Chicago crests.

631
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:08,560
So up to today, you can still see remnants of this horizon, almond bubble.

632
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:14,360
And also the reasons why they wanted to refine or give more detail to this consensus

633
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,280
green model and sector.

634
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,280
Yeah.

635
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:25,280
So I hope that these models make you think about how different cities look like.

636
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,400
And that they also make you aware of well, in different type of cities.

637
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,640
You have different ethnic groups, different socio-economic classes, making up different

638
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,640
parts of the city.

639
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,720
And this can be very different.

640
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,480
And for us also for example,

641
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,680
is a city where poverty is very central.

642
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:49,640
We have the medieval city, but then when you have

643
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,760
the medieval city, you get to a 19th century government

644
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,440
related to industrialization.

645
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,800
This is where you find the poorest neighborhood

646
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,080
across the spectrum of each world,

647
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,120
and it's just a small Los Angeles.

648
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,360
These are poor districts of the city.

649
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,080
And they are very close to the medieval artists.

650
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,760
You have other kinds of cities, for example.

651
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,800
Paris, where you have much more wealth,

652
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,400
close to the city center.

653
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,000
You have much of the poverty and very peripheral.

654
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,200
So it is interesting to compare differences

655
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,560
and to understand various poverty,

656
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:32,560
located where do different racial ethnic groups live in the city.

657
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:43,960
And so when you do that, you will also be able to make a simplified model of the city that you are familiar with,

658
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,960
the city that you want to study.

659
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,960
And you will also come to an understanding that this work is on point and there is an open bubbles are very simplistic.

660
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:59,480
And that in different countries, in different cities, you would have very different models.

661
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,880
And I have a couple of examples.

662
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,520
This is one from Kiausli that is also used in the textbook.

663
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,680
But you have in the British context, these council estates.

664
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,680
Yeah, built on peripheral land.

665
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,260
And so in a concentric ring where Ellis,

666
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,380
and

667
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,360
Burgess would expect private suburban housing,

668
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,000
you also have these council estates, just

669
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,320
like these volunteers in the French context.

670
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,600
very much of the poverty is horrifically,

671
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,440
while that contradicts a burden.

672
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,520
The Chinese city,

673
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,800
was ever a bird of the Cheng Cheng

674
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,600
truth, my pronunciation will become a bird.

675
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,200
Cheng Cheng,

676
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:56,400
nobody said this in China, also fast-growing.

677
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,640
In China, you basically have a noodle or an urban citizen.

678
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,360
The Google system, probably the third.

679
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:15,800
And you have villages, which were taken up by farmers,

680
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,960
which are noodle pieces of land.

681
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,520
And you have people with this noodle citizenship,

682
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,800
with the noodle living.

683
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,640
When people from the countryside migrate to the city,

684
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,640
they are able to take up residence in these old villages.

685
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,520
And because then, who took this citizenship

686
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,640
you might make, say it like that,

687
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,520
allows them to stay in this area.

688
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,080
So you have a many Chinese cities,

689
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,360
parts of the city that I look like that,

690
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,440
where you have a very formal part immediately next

691
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,640
to a part of the city that looks much more informal,

692
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:57,800
much more dense. And that's because when the city grows over this countryside,

693
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:04,720
that these rural villages from the past become these religious in the

694
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,020
city where they have a lot of newcomers arrived. And so in these Chinese

695
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:14,320
cities, the model of the Chinese city, we've looked very differently from

696
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:22,320
because you have these areas that used to be villages or centres of villages,

697
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:29,320
where you have people with emigrating from countryside, from other parts of China,

698
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,320
who arrived there.

699
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:37,320
So this change from true, I think it means something like village in the city.

700
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,320
And these are areas that I was just talking.

701
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:50,320
The African city, the play of a whole pro-life in 62, very different again.

702
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,320
Because transport is much more complicated, is African cities.

703
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:00,320
So, bridge people refer to the close to the cities and the poorest of them who are

704
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,320
right from the countryside will arrive at the very ends of the city,

705
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,320
and very peripheral locations where it takes you two or three hours to get to the south.

706
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:14,440
So this city is looking different again.

707
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:20,720
My Davis, Los Angeles, you might have heard of the Chicago School, Burbs, for example,

708
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:26,440
that you might also have heard of Los Angeles, who of course modern photographers riding

709
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,440
across Los Angeles.

710
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:34,720
And my Davis, and who wrote an interesting book in 1992 and tried to make the 1998

711
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:41,720
for me, a model of how people's angels look like in the night.

712
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:47,720
And you might have heard of Skit Row, this part of the city,

713
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,720
there's thousands of homeless people living on the street,

714
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,720
just next to the central business district of Los Angeles.

715
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:00,720
So this is the song of transition, and this is where the poorest of the poor live,

716
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,720
He needed the next to the central business.

717
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,400
But you also had a pet bike,

718
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,400
these gated developments at the periphery of the city,

719
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,760
where he had the richest of the rich living in these gated suburbs.

720
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,680
I'm sorry, you could also see that, basically, these borders

721
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,080
between the different drinks were being walled, fortified,

722
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,840
that is anchorage in the city.

723
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:34,840
So you're trying to make a mobile of Los Angeles in the 1990s.

724
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:44,840
Mark Vage's desperate poverty, some parts of the city, and then also this fell in other parts of the city.

725
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,840
And in the end there's still a lot of burgers in the small.

726
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:56,840
There's still the central business district, there's still the Corro, and there's still this forest of the poor living community next time.

727
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:01,640
in the zone of transition between mixed the factories and this little hell

728
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:07,880
or little system, but people living with the streets. And I'm not more able

729
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,920
out of this at the center of the rich earth, it's never good to get. It's also

730
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,560
very much good. So trying to make a follow up, Los Angeles, in that

731
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,560
that I did.

732
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,560
I'm also a little touchy.

733
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,560
Sorry.

734
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,360
Thank you.

735
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,480
Yeah, I-- one hour ago, I took out

736
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,980
the slides with a couple of four

737
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:34,160
telling-- again, trying to understand, for the post

738
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:39,360
socialist city and wood light, but then also using

739
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,720
ballot as an example, but also trying to understand

740
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,280
what kind of problems do we see in these socialist cities

741
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,200
and then in these post-social cities.

742
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,760
and how can we try to generalize the simplify.

743
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,800
And so that attempts to make a low is an attempt

744
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,080
to simplify reality and to try and understand

745
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,960
what this particular about cities.

746
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,600
And what makes Los Angeles different from Chicago

747
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,440
in 1925.

748
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,200
So you also have indeed puzzles for European cities.

749
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,360
This was a British city.

750
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,000
curiously in this council estates that you could also make a model for a

751
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,680
stuck hole and try to think like what the specific of a stuck hole

752
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:28,360
I understood the problem from better to all the cities and then we're like general models

753
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:35,400
by I think it's not because I'm so in there by the general one

754
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,400
I think not that I know because this this

755
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,600
This event has been like a special fashion of American events.

756
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:48,720
And indeed, you could think how these assumptions that burgers some that are that I have

757
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,280
some not only slide in it, finally fixed.

758
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,120
But there's some of them are, are, uh, actively European.

759
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:02,920
Like for example, this idea that there can be an early on energy, so your peak city

760
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,320
is then to have a long history.

761
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,540
So for that reason there are always parts of the city,

762
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,520
and to always something to have a growing city,

763
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:17,320
in a sense area, so you always have 30 land users

764
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,120
and you have a history of the city.

765
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:26,020
There's also much more state intervention in Europe.

766
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,820
So we could think like how European city

767
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:32,420
would be different from these assumptions or burgers.

768
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:36,820
I want that with me that for the mother-world.

769
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,620
I have found that, but it could be an interesting--

770
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,700
it could be an interesting exercise.

771
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,100
Good thing how it is, what makes--

772
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,140
what is particularly European out of the city?

773
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,060
And is this something like it?

774
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,860
I just told you that the rest of them

775
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,700
took different from Paris.

776
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,860
It was just two hours, so I'm not allowed by three.

777
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:03,300
So it might also be possible.

778
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,740
So I think it's like our idea of what we did

779
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:09,020
to know when we studied college for dinner

780
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,900
with joint comedy, why is there--

781
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,860
because I think alumni are going to be

782
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,020
in this three days, only last time

783
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:19,340
in the built-in scenario.

784
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,900
Since then, there's three for all.

785
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,100
Like, what will happen?

786
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,500
I know there's so much projects through your sewing states.

787
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,660
And I assume that, for example, when

788
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:31,040
the nervous was making up the model in front of the body.

789
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,440
That's almost less strict and less regulated.

790
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,840
And it is non-dicks.

791
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,960
And when you're also in you have a city that is growing that fast,

792
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:46,360
that is having 1 million extra inhabitants in the very short period of time.

793
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,520
And then the city grows fairly organically.

794
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:55,200
And then it's also very hard as a planet to be put with the base, but the city is growing it.

795
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,720
but I must have been in the eye.

796
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,680
Don't know so much about song in regulation.

797
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,160
When exactly it must become a state.

798
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:12,440
- I'm gonna mention the problem with the questionnaire

799
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,400
and the single that--

800
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,440
- Uh-huh, okay, and can you read it?

801
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,280
Or not to know?

802
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,880
- So I said that to, well, I will ever look

803
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,640
whether I can I can see.

804
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:29,080
Okay, I see some comments.

805
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,920
Yeah.

806
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,120
In the example from China,

807
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,120
how does the ownership of people of these states

808
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,720
where is the city grows over these villages?

809
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:45,600
Okay, I will,

810
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,640
I will, it's time for a break.

811
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,760
I will have a look at it.

812
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,840
I will have a look at what I find in public borders

813
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:59,840
It's hard for me to check this livestream that also, I also need to get out of PowerPoint to check that.

814
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:05,840
I'm teaching most important people here and I hope that the livestream first.

815
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,840
I'm going to say 5 minutes break. It's 4 past 6.

816
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,840
On my clock here, so let's start again 9 past 6 or 10 past 6.

885
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:24,160
So I will be asking if I will show you, let's go through it.

886
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:31,320
It seems there's urban differentiation, like that bridge, and four of them are the

887
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,320
neighborhoods.

888
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:38,320
There are people from different ethnicities, different generations of view colors that

889
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,800
they live in different neighborhoods.

890
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,200
somehow it seems to be some characteristic of most different whole cities.

891
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,340
I've been showing you a levels grow.

892
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:57,080
Africa, Los Angeles, Chicago, United Kingdom, and I've been talking about this model of

893
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,880
socialist or socialist.

894
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:04,960
It seems that in each of these levels there is this idea of different groups of society

895
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,220
and whether you define them in social economic classes

896
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:11,720
or different ethnicities or some of identity

897
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:15,080
by race, but these different groups

898
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,280
take a different part of the city.

899
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:22,220
And it also seems that different local features

900
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:25,040
impact of a permanent forum.

901
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,000
For example, this link in G.D.

902
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,800
I hope you could see that there are references

903
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,880
to the wins direction in some of these models,

904
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,960
migration, patterns, etc.

905
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,160
And obviously also local policies and transport system.

906
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,200
Stay in the region in housing,

907
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,520
desire B, for example,

908
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,000
the Scouts of the States for the body use

909
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,120
and the pre-career city.

910
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,120
And restrictions of mobility in the Chinese context

911
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:59,120
of the system determining where to live

912
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,000
or where you could set your kids to school.

913
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,760
strategies to counter the hypothesis.

914
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,840
So that also means that most of these models of urban form,

915
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,120
even if they say this is the bottle, the American city.

916
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,840
But they somehow wear bird marks that they are situated

917
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,280
in a specific space in a specific time.

918
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:24,000
The model of Chicago for 1920s was a model of the growing city.

919
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,800
And with this already 10 years later,

920
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,120
when this American economy has been hit by crisis,

921
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,720
is modeled with not all true anymore

922
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:36,320
because the city was not growing at the fast pace.

923
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,920
And so it's always about situating these models

924
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,320
in time and space.

925
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,880
And so that also makes it necessary to provincial us

926
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,280
at the theories about it.

927
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,280
Oh, great.

928
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,520
And I like to show you some exact questions

929
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:58,160
to make you think like how will I ever make you--

930
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,520
like what kind of questions could you

931
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,520
you straight from this and this is a question that I've asked for in 2016.

932
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,520
You have the model on the side African, both of our state city,

933
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,520
by a particular author and then all our familiar,

934
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,520
all of you are with this studio fund.

935
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,520
Apart from that, so let's recap,

936
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,520
repeal of this, Apart from that, also.

937
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,520

938
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,520
Right.

939
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:26,520
So you have some references to this legend.

940
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,880
And then I asked you which elements of variousoids and errors of the

941
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,760
Do you recognize in this model?

942
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,760
What about that?

943
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,760
Sit.

944
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,640
That's really a way to check whether you understood what these models are

945
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,640
about.

946
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,280
You're able to apply that to another one.

947
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,280
Yeah?

948
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,680
>> I was touched.

949
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,680
>> What are we doing?

950
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,080
>> Don't anyone have to take time?

951
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,080
>> Yes.

952
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:59,080
the following model.

953
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,080
They have, I found it in a book that I don't remember,

954
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,080
which is perfect.

955
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,080
They should ever look and know I don't.

956
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,080
I can look at it.

957
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,080
I don't know if they'll do the thought.

958
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,080
I can tell you also the thoughts.

959
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:22,080
So first, our these classical models of perfect form,

960
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,560
but also some more reasons

961
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,680
and place with several models.

962
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,920
But I'm going to discuss now with patterns of segregation.

963
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:40,400
How can we look at segregation in cities?

964
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:45,400
And I will use the definition by two American authors

965
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,320
again, Messi and Beno Duchs-Smesi,

966
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,320
and Nancy Netton to America's sociologist,

967
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,240
who wrote a book called American Apartments.

968
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:59,880
So you see this reference to the silent written signals.

969
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,920
But in the thinking on segregation,

970
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,680
this book has been quite important.

971
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:08,000
And so you see here, what is the definition?

972
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,600
First of all, they focus on the residential segregation.

973
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,840
I could also discuss segregation in leisure spaces.

974
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,760
how many people who play sports or the places

975
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,920
where people spend their leisure time,

976
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,080
how we are desegregate, or I could look at work segregation

977
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,280
to people of different socioeconomic losses

978
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,240
meet each other on work, but most of the work

979
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:37,480
on segregation focuses on residential segregation.

980
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,720
What is residential segregation?

981
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,760
It's a degree to which two or four groups

982
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:49,320
of every unit, find it, this separately from each other in different parts of the urban

983
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:55,800
confiring. And that's the decision. Now what you see in these models that I'm going to show you

984
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:06,440
in the previous hours is that in most cities, different groups that you find them in a social

985
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:14,880
economic rate for this ethnicity, race, self-identifying,

986
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,120
that indeed in all of the cities,

987
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,880
different groups to live in different parts of the city.

988
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,080
That's all within each of these cities,

989
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,080
where this model is.

990
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:25,920
Eight.

991
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,320
It would make sense to look at residential segregation.

992
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,800
As a more, is the messy and dense one

993
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,120
to make this a little bit more complex?

994
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,120
And they say most of the research on segregation

995
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,920
has been too senseless because it looked at segregation

996
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,320
in one particular way.

997
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,400
And so what I'm going to do with you now

998
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:51,520
is to look at, for this, just five dimensions of segregation.

999
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,680
For messy and then, these are called evenness, exposure,

1000
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:59,720
concentration, centralization, and plustery.

1001
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,360
And also the research on segregation

1002
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,760
is discussing evenness.

1003
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,800
So I'm also to look at it.

1004
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,000
What is evenness?

1005
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,800
Evenness refers-- and I'm just reading what you see on slide now--

1006
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,760
refers to the differential distribution

1007
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:24,320
of two social groups among aerial units in a city.

1008
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,160
So a minority group is said to be segregated

1009
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:33,000
if it is unevenly distributed over aerial units.

1010
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Evenness is not measured in any absolute sense,

1011
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,600
but it's scaled relative to some other group.

1012
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:44,600
So we are able to save in this city.

1013
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,840
This is the example that you see there.

1014
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,920
Lights are segregated from blacks.

1015
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:55,840
Or the low socioeconomic losses, if you may call it,

1016
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,000
same like that, are segregated from a high socioeconomic

1017
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:08,000
bridge is segregated from. So you always need these two groups. So you see here that you

1018
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:19,000
can have index, here is this here, and index of this similarity can be calculated. And

1019
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:26,600
I will give you two examples. Some years this goes out of the realm and sometimes this

1020
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:33,880
goes wrong. Imagine that you have a city that is made up of four districts. And in each

1021
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:50,840
of these, you have 75 whites and 25 whites. What would be the index of this similarity

1022
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:59,360
When I use the measure layer, we need to take half of the sum,

1023
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,960
that is what this great sigma is being.

1024
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,680
And now we need to, for each of these neighborhoods,

1025
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,800
we need to say what is the length of relation in an area.

1026
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:16,160
If I just write total length of relation, 25 to 5, 100,

1027
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:24,280
minus 75 the white population in area 1 divided by the

1028
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,600
social white population.

1029
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:31,800
What do we have here for one neighborhood?

1030
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,720
Zero.

1031
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,840
Yeah?

1032
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,920
And it would calculate the sum for this measure for each of

1033
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,520
these neighborhoods so that there will be zero,

1034
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:47,320
a 0, 0, 0, 1/2, 0, 0.

1035
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:54,320
The index of this similarity would be 0, or 0%.

1036
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:59,720
This corresponds with the fact that you need to move 0%

1037
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,520
of the population in order to get an even distribution

1038
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,520
of white and black across the city.

1039
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,280
Because you have an even distribution.

1040
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,520
In each of these four neighborhoods,

1041
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:15,520
You have as many whites as you have in other parts of the city.

1042
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:21,680
And you can also look at another example,

1043
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:26,680
where you would have 100 legs living in one neighborhood,

1044
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:33,040
100 whites in another, 100 whites in another,

1045
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,480
and another 100 whites in another neighborhood.

1046
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:39,200
And if you would make the calculation now,

1047
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,720
and you will get to one, not going to do the computer,

1048
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:46,160
but for those who are able to do this,

1049
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,440
this means the absolute number of this.

1050
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,640
So if you get to a negative number here,

1051
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,560
then it comes closer to the end.

1052
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,400
When you calculate that, it will be,

1053
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,000
then the number will be one.

1054
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,600
Yes.

1055
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,240
And because you will, again,

1056
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,760
so do that with you.

1057
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,840
This is a sum of 100, the number of price

1058
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,840
in the first neighborhood minus 100, the total number of x,

1059
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,160
minus the number of y's in the neighborhood zero,

1060
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,480
and 500, 100, 300.

1061
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:22,000
And for each number, each of these neighborhoods,

1062
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,280
you will get to the number one,

1063
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:30,080
and here you will get one, third, one, third, one, third,

1064
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,200
total two, half of two, one.

1065
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:37,040
Meaning you need to move 100% of the population

1066
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:42,960
order to get an even distribution of these population groups across the city. Either you move

1067
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:52,960
33 flecks from this neighborhood to this neighborhood. And then you can get if you move 33

1068
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:58,560
to each of these, then you get an even distribution of flecks across the city. Or you move all

1069
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:03,280
the white people to that black neighborhood. And then you would also get to the reason this

1070
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,680
some people across the city, according to this neighborhood.

1071
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:11,700
And so there's an index of this singularity,

1072
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:15,320
range is from zero, even this distribution

1073
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,760
to one fairly uneven distribution.

1074
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,240
And basically, in corresponds with a percentage

1075
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,840
of people that you would be moved in order

1076
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:28,240
to get an even distribution of people across different neighborhoods.

1077
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,400
And so this may be complicated,

1078
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,320
But you can just look at the practice.

1079
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,720
So how does this look like?

1080
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,080
You would get to a number.

1081
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,600
This is this percentage.

1082
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:45,560
And what you see here, for example, is that--

1083
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:49,840
so 0 was an even distribution.

1084
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,080
But this example, Y_hunder, very uneven.

1085
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,160
And so the more you look at the prides on this slide,

1086
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,760
more uneven disease are.

1087
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,600
So what is particular is that you see,

1088
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,800
as first of all, American cities tend to be much more

1089
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,360
unpleasable than European ones.

1090
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:13,680
Yeah, so segregation, when you look at the dimension,

1091
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:18,440
evenness, then you find out that in American cities,

1092
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:22,440
the poor, for example, are living much more

1093
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,080
in particular parts of the city.

1094
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:30,040
in the European context, they are a bit more spread across different parts of the city.

1095
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:40,440
And so you see here for different cities and for different population groups, you see how this has been

1096
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:46,440
done. And again, you always need to compare it with another population group. So what is done is

1097
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:50,840
the poor of Edward compared with then the ones who are not considered to be.

1098
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:59,560
And so it's also interesting for those who joined into M-Turk to see that according to these

1099
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:10,680
statistics, poverty in M-Turk in 2005 was also much more unevenly strengthened across the city.

1100
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:17,320
So you had particular neighborhoods where you had that were marked by poverty much more than in

1101
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:26,120
other European schools. This also is scale-ish Belgium and in a very small statistical sectors

1102
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:33,640
that's a part of the explanation. Scale is important, but these sectors grow. They will mask

1103
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:38,920
some of the concentrations of poverty of health that you get in this at least 60 to the

1104
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:54,680
or defined. So this measure of evenness, yeah? So more numbers, again you see that 90,

1105
01:25:54,680 --> 01:26:01,320
and so you get close to 1, Birmingham Bangladesh, I read there, "All time Bangladesh,

1106
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:08,760
called the Bangladesh. So apparently this Bangladesh sheet in UK cities are living very much in

1107
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:15,960
particular neighborhoods of the city. And in these neighborhoods you would find almost exclusively

1108
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:22,280
by much and that explains why you would need to move almost all these Bangladeshic or other

1109
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:28,280
neighborhoods if you would like to get to an even distribution of Bangladeshic in UK cities.

1110
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:35,680
And so you see how this measure is being used in order to say something about residential

1111
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:41,360
segregation in these different cities.

1112
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:50,320
Poverty in Copenhagen, the first quintile will be like the first 20% of the people according

1113
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:58,720
to the income distribution is much less segregated and it spreads much more evenly across

1114
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:05,720
the sick and is in all the other cities that are missing there. So do you understand what

1115
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:14,500
is measure of evenness and evenness means? Yeah? Okay. I get now to these four other

1116
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:19,000
dimensions. So what Messian and Desmond are arguing is that we have been looking at

1117
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,400
segregation, goes through this lens of evenness. There are also four other dimensions,

1118
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:28,160
which are worthwhile, I will leave it.

1119
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,160
That a question.

1120
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,480
- Oh, I would sort of make for an honest example,

1121
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,120
with the one hundred black residents in one end,

1122
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,200
and then the two-second, right, I didn't say,

1123
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:42,040
what does it, what does it need for if you want there,

1124
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:45,240
for the, for white residents in one second,

1125
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,480
and black residents?

1126
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:51,280
Or did I need to put that on? - Well, I'm just,

1127
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,840
I am just for each of these neighborhoods.

1128
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,880
I am calculating, I didn't want to grow too much into this.

1129
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,280
I am calculating this.

1130
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:06,360
And I start from the black neighbor roots.

1131
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:09,580
Their measure for the number will be 100 divided

1132
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:13,220
by 100 to the total number by minus the neighbor

1133
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:16,160
within our zero whites divided by total number

1134
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,800
of whites to be 100.

1135
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,520
That will be one.

1136
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,680
For the white neighbor roots,

1137
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:25,440
and I have three of them. The measure will be there are zero

1138
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:30,240
of legs and I have minus 100, the number of whites in that

1139
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:34,400
neighborhood divided by the total number of whites 300.

1140
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,880
Yeah? So I get here to 1 divided by 3, 1.

1141
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:46,880
And so I get 1 plus 1/3, 1/2 plus 1/3 plus 1/3, 2

1142
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,240
divided by 2, 2.

1143
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,600
But it doesn't say anything about these neighborhoods.

1144
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,800
I'm calculating something at the scale of the city.

1145
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:01,200
And for that, I need to calculate this measure for these four neighborhoods.

1146
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,200
>> Okay, you can add on this.

1147
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:09,200
>> And then I think I realized I know how to do it.

1148
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:15,200
>> And then I need to make the sum of this number in each of these.

1149
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:24,940
So that will be sum of 1 plus 1/3 of 2.

1150
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:30,000
And I need to be vided.

1151
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,640
But that's 1.

1152
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:37,880
But the index of the similarities is 1 in this case.

1153
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:44,640
100% meaning that either 100% of x or 100% of y's

1154
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:54,400
need to move in order to get to an even distribution of both wide sunwax across the seat.

1155
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,400
Okay.

1156
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,320
Four other, yeah?

1157
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:22,180
[inaudible]

1158
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:29,440
Yeah, that's the percentage. So then this would be 100, and this would be zero. And if the index of this

1159
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:34,440
the same level would be 0.5, then you would have 50%.

1160
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,760
And that would be 50.

1161
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:42,080
And so you move close to one, and you are close to zero.

1162
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:46,040
But this is a measure that you would often find in the loop,

1163
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,680
in the loop.

1164
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:52,320
And it would also be often checked like our segregation

1165
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,760
changing across time.

1166
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,000
And it would be the index of the similarity

1167
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:07,520
first hand work has moved from 0.40 to 0.6 in an equal dot order concentrated over time.

1168
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,000
Or more say you need it. Sorry, I'm not using it because more say good.

1169
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:22,560
So I got less evenly distributed across time. Okay, for other dimensions I'm going to move

1170
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,880
to them rather quickly.

1171
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:35,520
There's a potential exposure, which first is the degree of potential context or the possibility

1172
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,600
of interaction.

1173
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:44,240
In this case, in each of the neighborhoods, there is a similar degree of exposure.

1174
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:49,560
The other is when these people limit their lives to the neighborhoods, there will be no

1175
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:59,000
approaches. So this degree is fairly close to evenness but not completely because for exposure

1176
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:07,320
and the number will also be depending upon the total size of these communities. If the total

1177
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:13,720
black population in the city is very low then the chances that you will get to meet a black

1178
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,520
a person are lower already.

1179
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,920
And so the size of the group is important if you would

1180
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:24,000
make a measure for exposure.

1181
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,720
Concentration, dimension number three

1182
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,920
refers to the relative amount of physical space

1183
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,920
over five by a minority group in the urban environment.

1184
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,320
So again, it depends on the size of this one.

1185
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,360
3F here in Haton.

1186
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,280
And we have been these different colors

1187
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,520
again, these different ethnic or racial groups,

1188
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:50,080
or people self-identifying with a particular group.

1189
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:54,520
And so you see that in shades of purple,

1190
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,760
you have the Asian population.

1191
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,280
And so you have China,

1192
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:04,480
and that's where most of these Asians are concentrated.

1193
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,920
They take up a very small amount of space.

1194
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,760
This is a dense neighborhood.

1195
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:16,560
most agents living in Manhattan or living in that particular part of Manhattan.

1196
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:24,240
So concentration, the relative amount of physical space occupied by a minority group.

1197
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:28,360
Number four, center of the city.

1198
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:33,760
It relates to the creed to which a group is spatially located near the center of an

1199
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:40,960
I don't know what the center of New York would be, but if you say it's Wall Street, then these

1200
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,680
Asians are living very centralized.

1201
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:52,000
And while like Africans in the case of New York are not living central anymore.

1202
01:33:52,000 --> 01:34:01,120
The same goes for this example of poverty. In Brussels, poverty is very much centralized.

1203
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,720
these neighborhoods which are marked by COBRT are close to the city center.

1204
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:15,760
In the Parisian days, 40 is very much decentralized. That's much more an issue of these peripheral

1205
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:26,800
volunteers. And in the last dimension is clustering. The degree to which these aerial units

1206
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:34,560
inhabited by minority members and join one another or not. I don't know how familiar you are

1207
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:41,200
with New York, but I remember walking out of the metro station in Flushing, close to Flushing

1208
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:47,520
Meadows where you have the tennis tournament and that was another neighborhood and that was

1209
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,680
was very much marked by a presence of Chinese people.

1210
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:56,680
Yeah, the Soviet have clusters of,

1211
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:02,120
at least two clusters of agents, one in this China attack,

1212
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:05,560
an attack, and another one somewhere here in Russia.

1213
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:11,800
Yeah, and so is the presence of agents,

1214
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:15,840
is a cluster, no, because there are two neighborhoods

1215
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,760
which are quite far away from each other.

1216
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:24,680
Even this exposure,

1217
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:30,240
for the centralization, concentration, cluster.

1218
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:34,280
And so I could also ask you in the exam

1219
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:40,040
to discuss the three most relevant dimension

1220
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,440
of messy and messy,

1221
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,200
or the ones that you still remember.

1222
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:51,520
to these five to discuss social economic segregation process.

1223
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,760
Is over the Western or not?

1224
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,120
Is it centralized or not?

1225
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,120
Is it concentrated or not?

1226
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,760
Is that even the same?

1227
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:08,480
And the data might allow you to say something about it or not.

1228
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:13,720
I already told you when I pointed at these high numbers

1229
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:18,720
of unevenness in entered, that scale is fairly important.

1230
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:24,360
So now here this is a pattern of rich and poor

1231
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:29,440
and you will only detect it as segregation

1232
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:33,160
when you are able to study it at the scale of these

1233
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,960
specific neighborhoods.

1234
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,880
And if your statistical units are this big,

1235
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,240
then it would be, then this would be of any events

1236
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:51,880
you're able to study it at this scale, then this is a very uneven. And so the more refined

1237
01:36:51,880 --> 01:37:00,120
these statistics allow you to grow the higher one with assume these levels of segregation or even

1238
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:09,480
this unevenness will be. So scale and the scale through which you look is something very important

1239
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:15,480
this one. I saw a hand somewhere at the bank and I'm only with the discretion for the relevant death.

1240

[ Inaudible ]

1241
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:45,780
Well, I could imagine, like, some already have a CBD.

1242
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:49,820
And we have four neighborhoods around the CBD,

1243
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,820
part by poverty.

1244
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:55,860
And you would say that poverty is centralized,

1245
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:58,060
but it's not clustered.

1246
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:00,980
And it is also-- is it concentrated on it?

1247
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:06,480
The role of this amount of space and a less

1248
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:13,480
They are related to each other, but there is still something visiting about the digital

1249
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:17,480
associations of poverty, which are very decentralized.

1250
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:24,480
They still put the poor paper-pated space, but this is far away from the city centre.

1251
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:30,480
And then the question could still be whether this poverty is clustered with the you have in the east of the city

1252
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:38,480
or this is roots which are adjacant to each other and is over deep, concentrated.

1253
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:48,480
Or rather this poverty is also decentralized, but also not clustered and not translated.

1254
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:57,480
So you could imagine you could imagine you need to start playing poverty decentralized.

1255
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:02,480
You also expected to be some of the close to the majority.

1256
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:05,480
They are not.

1257
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,480
They are not.

1258
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:11,480
Well, for groups of people, in a sense of data,

1259
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:16,480
they should not understand that today or what,

1260
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:19,480
and I should not present something.

Some are in the center of the arms of the thing.

1262
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:33,360
And you would say, "On routine is centralized in the people, our centralized in Brussels,

Well, then it will still be relevant to say that.

It's not a danger.

1267
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:08,520
OK, so five dimensions of segregation,

1268
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:12,960
which also allow you to speak with a little bit more detail

1269
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,760
about the social differentiation that you find.

1270
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:19,880
So some only about evenness, people living

1271
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,200
in different neighborhoods of the system.

1272
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:25,280
You can also discuss concentration plus three central

There's another question.

1275
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,840
Yeah.

1276
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:33,640
I'm just wondering what the concentration,

1277
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,680
does it matter like the portion,

1278
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,520
like the size of the population?

1279
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:42,160
Like I demanded a city that they're just not very nice.

1280
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:44,480
Very few people are bored of their,

1281
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,960
and then you should have a couple of neighbors

1282
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,280
that are in the first book,

1283
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,320
and that would be all concentrated,

1284
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:53,720
and how we can help the management experience.

1285
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,360
How are many people?

1286
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,560
Yeah, I must admit that I don't know exactly how this

1287
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:01,880
would be measured and how it would operate

1288
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,840
in a certain measure.

1289
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:09,280
But here, it will be about the size of the group,

1290
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,960
how many Chinese do they have?

1291
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:14,400
It will be about the densities that you are talking about.

1292
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:18,360
Tower, it will also be a dangerous square meters

1293
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:22,280
but it implements neighborhoods.

1294
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:25,700
But I don't know how you're with exactly operationalized

1295
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:29,600
that's in this kind of way.

1296
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,680
But for me, the important thing is

1297
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,500
that you understand that there are different front

1298
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:36,960
pages that you can understand this spatial

1299
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,480
differentiation between racial or between like the bias

1300
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:46,760
or between male and female or between normal sexual sexual.

1301
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:49,360
You can look at it in many different ways,

1302
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,360
but that you will be able to study it through this final language.

1303
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:58,320
For me, that's important.

1304
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,300
And I will ask you how to measure

1305
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:03,960
that's around to operationalize it.

1306
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:09,320
But I hope that you understand that it can be meaningful to do it.

1307
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:14,760
And that is, for example, a figure from your statistical

1308
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:32,760
for culture, for example, you have different kinds of cities, topological and German cities. And it matters whether the rich, for example, still meet a different indigenous cities where rich, do not need to come to meet, do not need to be to.

1309
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:39,160
For example, in the Brussels case, these poor neighborhoods are so close to it.

1310
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:45,880
Okay, just do these neighborhoods where each people work, for example.

1311
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:51,080
You would get all conflicts around the front place, but in other kinds of cities,

1312
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:53,640
that would necessarily beat a case.

1313
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:59,160
So for that reason, these kinds of dimensions do matter.

1314
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:05,320
And I could ask you to apply that to a particular city.

01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:13,280
[ Inaudible ]

1331
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,280
>> Okay.

1332
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:14,280
>> Okay.

1333
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:14,280
>> Okay.

1334
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:14,280
>> Okay.

1335
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:15,280
>> Okay.

1336
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,280
>> Yeah.

1337
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,280
>> Yeah.

1338
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:24,280
>> There are many explanations.

1339
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:25,280
>> Yeah.

1340
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:30,280
>> And it is important for me, but I'm going to try to do

1341
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:35,880
in a very short period of time is to run through a couple of typical explanations.

1342
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,680
But I find important is that I'm showing you this crop.

1343
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:45,280
I think you've seen it already in some of the previous classes by the University of

1344
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,280
of Austin.

1345
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:53,880
And so what is important for me is that different drug workers or urban thinkers or people

1346
01:45:53,880 --> 01:46:05,880
over a human domain of students that have been coming up with different explanations, that also it matters very much from which sub-discipline that they are looking at.

1347
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:18,880
And so family and instructors have been pointing at different explanations of segregation than Marxist-chair-person.

1348
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:23,040
And so for that reason, it is important to situate

1349
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:28,040
this theory to explain segregation on this match.

1350
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,840
And my take on it is that one explanation is not

1351
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,400
better than the other.

1352
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,360
But in order to understand what is happening,

1353
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:37,520
we need to look at financial limits of people.

1354
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,920
And Marxists will have a big theory about it.

1355
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,120
And but also a choice.

1356
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,880
And it will be mostly these.

1357
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:49,880
there are the even older history childrens

1358
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:53,720
who are eager to explore the preferences of people

1359
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:57,440
and why people want to live in a particular neighborhood.

1360
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,640
And they will also then go to interview and say,

1361
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:03,040
why is it that you move subverts?

1362
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:08,480
So my point is, I think it's important that you unravel

1363
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:11,480
these different theories made up by these different thinkers

1364
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:13,520
from different disciplines.

1365
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:19,240
quantitative geographers in the 60s

1366
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,720
were not so interested in explanations or segregation,

1367
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,960
but they had a rich set of mapping tools

1368
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:29,640
to understand these spatial patterns,

1369
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:33,360
but they were not so interested in explanations.

1370
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:38,160
Ecological models, Bergus, she would go and read Bergus,

1371
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:43,400
1925 concentric solo, why do these different population groups

1372
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:45,860
and look at different parts of the city.

1373
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:49,760
Almost like you would have this pioneer fit of fit.

1374
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:52,280
So imagine the beauty area of land.

1375
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:54,780
First you would find grass,

1376
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:56,120
and then you would find shrubs,

1377
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:59,720
and as the shrubs grow, the grass cannot survive anymore

1378
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:04,120
because there's no fighting for the grass.

1379
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:05,760
And then you would get these big trees,

1380
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,000
and these shrubs can also not survive.

1381
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,920
So you would have competition amongst different types

1382
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,600
of which they should put their competition

1383
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,760
amongst different populations.

1384
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:20,440
You would have innovation to most desire parts.

1385
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:23,160
So we talk about ecological models.

1386
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:27,800
Because when you read these 100-year-old theories,

1387
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:33,960
that often you find these analogies with ecological models

1388
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:39,800
at your vegetation or the survival of the fittest

1389
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:41,400
almost.

1390
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:46,600
So ecological models they draw on theories of expansion, competition,

1391
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:49,900
in patients, your session of different countries,

1392
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:55,520
in analogy to what you find in among plants.

1393
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:59,440
For Marxist-Jokers, different neighborhoods,

1394
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:06,120
different built environments, our parts of circuits of capital.

1395
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:09,400
And so to understand why different neighborhoods

1396
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:11,560
are produced for different people.

1397
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:15,320
We need to understand the flows of capital,

1398
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:17,600
the entirety of its state,

1399
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:22,760
and look at the circuits in which this built environment

1400
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,280
features.

1401
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:30,560
For instance, I'm not going to discuss this whole figure.

1402
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,920
But for example, to understand super-binization,

1403
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:43,560
We also need to understand the archivalization regime in which this super-venisation came

1404
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:44,560
across.

1405
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:50,620
And how for example, after the second world war in Belgium, super-venisation was promoted

1406
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:56,560
by the state also because it was a start of a consumption spiral when you suburbanize,

1407
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,560
you meet a car.

1408
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,120
And so people will buy more cars.

1409
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:05,520
You will need a fridge because this local shop is far away. You will need a freezer

1410
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:11,440
Yeah, so there's a whole consumption spiral that starts when people so urban

1411
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,920
So in order to understand why

1412
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:19,260
Superventization of the millic losses was promoted in Belgium, March 36, of course

1413
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:24,920
We need to understand that a group of patients received enriched this function sport

1414
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:30,400
to understand why neighborhoods are being gentrified

1415
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,160
and to understand the rent.

1416
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:35,440
Which many of you have lost us by material thinking

1417
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:36,740
and as well that you will explain

1418
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:38,940
how this rent gets worse.

1419
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:44,080
So he tries to understand when you look at gentrification

1420
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:49,720
to a rent gets, say, well, effectively have an invasion

1421
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:53,880
of gentrifying us to borrow this word from burgers

1422
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:57,400
to understand that you need to understand the red gap

1423
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,680
and the fact that profit can be made in this neighborhood.

1424
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:03,800
So this is part of capital accumulation.

1425
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:08,320
And so radical marks as drug workers will focus on the fact

1426
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:11,440
that you have the rich in the suburbs or the jail,

1427
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,400
and the rich in this gentrifying neighborhood

1428
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:17,320
stable type understand how that fits within this process

1429
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:19,440
of capital accumulation.

1430
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,400
Their explanation of segregation will therefore

1431
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:29,400
be rooted in the circuits of capital that Harvey is trying.

1432
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:37,900
In the text by Michael Benvener, the review and the read about the neo-reb

1433
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:37,900
reb

1434
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:44,400
area, there are more constraints to people than only these financial constraints. It's also

1435
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:49,400
about discrimination and it's about the social capital that you have. Are you here about

1436
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:55,800
different resources that might be important in finding a place to it. And I also

1437
01:51:55,800 --> 01:52:02,600
the constraints that link to that. And I want to have there at the bottom is

1438
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:10,200
discrimination by people in the real estate systems for different population groups in

1439
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:15,200
in Belgium. You see that there are some significant

1440
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:22,200
and so it's not only about the financial resources that you have.

1441
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:25,200
It's also about your last name, whether that's sexual

1442
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:28,200
French or whether that is an aramic name that will

1443
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:32,200
impact often how easy it is for you to find an apartment or

1444
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:37,200
a place to buy in Belgium.

1445
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:46,080
behavioral drug efforts that are interested in the preference and the perceptions and the decision-making of

1446
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:49,720
visual. So for them to explain

1447
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:54,960
suburbanizations and affect these middle-class families move to the suburbs.

1448
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,320
They will think about

1449
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:02,960
push and both things. Why do these people prefer to leave the city? It is

1450
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:07,080
or humans, this overcrowded is the animal,

1451
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:09,480
grime, and so on.

1452
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:13,640
Why are people attracted to the surface well

1453
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,720
that are different pieces for them?

1454
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:19,920
But in order to understand segregation,

1455
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:22,040
you also need to understand the preferences

1456
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:24,400
of these different populations.

1457
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,240
It's not only about restraints,

1458
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:30,640
it's not only about capital accumulation,

1459
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:33,680
It's also about different groups of people

1460
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:36,920
preferring to live in different kinds of environments.

1461
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:39,640
Students will also be segregated from non-students

1462
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:42,000
because we have a certain, many of you will have

1463
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,880
a similar set of preferences that make you not live in

1464
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:47,640
the suburbs, I guess, but that will make you

1465
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:51,680
the closer to the university, closer to places

1466
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:53,800
where interesting things are happening.

1467
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:59,080
And then you also read in this text by

1468
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:01,240
a long time can be done.

1469
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:03,600
And there's a regular one you will also read about

1470
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,840
at the cultural.

1471
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:06,640
You can also look at these preferences

1472
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,720
through an ethnic lens.

1473
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:13,320
And for example, to explain why people

1474
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:18,000
are broken, Turkish origin in the city of Antwerp

1475
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,760
by they live in particular neighborhoods.

1476
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:24,480
You will need to understand their financial restraints.

1477
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:27,240
And they have them to be rather poor.

1478
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:32,160
And so they are forced to live in cheap parts of the city

1479
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:34,200
or cheaper parts of the city.

1480
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,400
But you also need to understand their preferences.

1481
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:39,120
And you can also look at that through an ethnic lens.

1482
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:40,720
And many of these more weapons will be

1483
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,800
either too close to a mosque or too really close

1484
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,240
to the Turkish paper or close to a halal butcher.

1485
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:49,960
And that makes that kind of a big box.

1486
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:53,960
So you can also look through these preferences.

1487
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:56,320
So if you look at these preferences through

1488
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:59,960
and ethnic lips, you could use the same lens

1489
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:03,120
to understand why more and more these more

1490
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:05,360
African families or people for families

1491
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:08,800
or for origin also move to the surface.

1492
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:13,800
That will also be a reference really to a visit.

1493
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:17,760
For example, government bail along

1494
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:21,560
who studied this in the enter of context found out

1495
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:27,320
already quite some time ago, that in these ethnic neighborhoods, as there are also people,

1496
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:32,800
they also have very tight methods of social control, so to move out of these neighborhoods

1497
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:38,760
is also to output this, to move away from the social control in these areas. So you

1498
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:46,680
could have another preference that is linked to this reference. So the ethnic cultural

1499
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:52,600
approach where you look at these preferences through an ethnic lens and obviously it can also be

1500
01:55:52,600 --> 01:56:01,160
a criticism. So if Mother and Joker first they will try to understand how housing is important in

1501
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:09,160
identity, kind of raising the truth, conceptualize yourself and the meaning that housing or living

1502
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:14,680
in a particular apartment since he is tasting them. So you see here a whole new title, they

1503
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:17,440
They clap under meaning of house.

1504
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:21,320
And how is it more than just a roof above your head?

1505
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:25,760
It's also about home and feeling at home.

1506
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:27,660
And so these post-post-mother-joker

1507
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:31,160
they try to understand segregation from this lens.

1508
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:35,520
And so they try to understand what moving to the suburbs

1509
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:40,320
means for these milli-class people who did that in the 60s.

1510
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,800
That was a thing to do if you had the money,

1511
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,560
you're reading the quote, well,

1512
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,640
and then you move to the servers.

1513
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:49,760
And so this idea of social mobility

1514
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:54,280
and showing off somehow was quite important

1515
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:56,920
in understanding why this group of people

1516
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:59,440
moved to the servers.

1517
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,080
And we can do the same for,

1518
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:08,560
for why these gender fires move back

1519
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,560
this often set them to the cities.

1520
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:14,520
It'll also be about a certain identity.

1521
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:34,520
and spend a lot of time to keep the output to see here.

1522
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:38,520
This is also something that is very much promoted by the citizens.

1523
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:45,520
And for example, skier to get these gender fibers and little phosphon, these white, little phosphon,

1524
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:55,520
the tuxion, on these pictures to get them to live in the city because it helps them to have a text space.

1525
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:01,520
So if you want to have money to spend in the city, you will need in the building system,

1526
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:05,520
you will need people currently not from the part of their ecosystem.

1527
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:12,520
And in the city, the city council can do this.

1528
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:19,520
So I'm not really making myself very clear, but the bottom line is that the social and

1529
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:24,960
of the majority of the sites understand why people end up in different parts of the city

1530
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:31,680
through the lens of identity and how we identify as people with the place where we live,

1531
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:37,920
what that means for ourself and others looking in other parts of the city.

1532
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:46,800
I've been really into these slides, yet again the bottom line for me is that to understand why

1533
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:50,080
people live in different neighborhoods that we might need all these

1534
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:54,320
feelings and then it will be about the Marxist idea of capital

1535
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,880
implementation. It will be allowed to nail

1536
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:01,440
very many resources and constraints that we have looked at. It will be

1537
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,920
about the preferences of people that assume this

1538
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:07,360
picture of the first very interesting will be about

1539
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:10,800
identity formation and what is for mother's

1540
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:14,480
geography of first-born interests. So I could give you another

1541
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:20,720
exam questions. Look at this map there, this confusion of people of Turkish and Moroccan origin

1542
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:27,120
in Antwerp. How were these different photographers explained it? And many of the explanations that

1543
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:33,760
you've given in the beginning of the... So when I started the form of the also of segregation,

1544
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:40,800
having studied five different drug workers learning some disciplines for people in different

1545
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,080
parts of what is simply cultural mistakes.

1546
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:48,240
Of course, why do we do that?

1547
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:53,400
Is because we assume that this matters and that segregation has effects and has

1548
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:55,360
cultural interests.

1549
01:59:55,360 --> 02:00:03,440
That many people have been eager to understand what was the key for a poor person to this

1550
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,440
and neighborhood that is part by whole.

1551
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:10,040
And most people who are people who are living around it doesn't matter whether you

1552
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:11,840
And that kind of neighborhood, the way that you

1553
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:14,720
as a person is in a more mixed neighborhood.

1554
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:18,560
And you have middle class, which is the same.

1555
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,560
And we're doing it.

1556
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:21,440
And we're doing it for a city.

1557
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,320
And when you have this segregation

1558
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:26,440
of legs living in a particular part of the city

1559
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:29,240
and have a wide-staking of different kinds,

1560
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:32,200
or would it be better to strive for this kind of more

1561
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:35,860
even distribution of legs and a wide-stin

1562
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:44,420
the particular city, or region tour, or young people and old people, whatever social imagery

1563
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:47,580
we used to do.

1564
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:53,580
So next week, I will not discuss patterned those segregation, causes those segregation, but

1565
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:56,340
I will discuss these effects of segregation.

1566
02:00:56,340 --> 02:01:03,700
And also, policies of social mixing that are related to them, you get to the heart of

1567
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:06,980
why doesn't matter to study this?

1568
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:11,940
Well, is we just reassume that segregation, concentration,

1569
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:15,460
centralization that is a whole ethics for the people

1570
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:19,700
that we have been talking to them for these two hours?

1571
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:25,060
So in two weeks time, another class on the ethics of segregation.

1572
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:28,980
Next week, Tuesday, feels like to end work,

1573
02:01:28,980 --> 02:01:33,980
There are various guests on the field, many of these issues as well.

1574
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:42,660
So I would forward to see many of you in a tour of the Tuesday 8th something in the real

1575
02:01:42,660 --> 02:01:44,660
So see you soon.

1576
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:46,660
soon.

1577
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:48,900
(coughing)

1578
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:51,480
(upbeat music)

1579
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:53,880
(mumbling)

1580
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:56,460
(mumbling)
