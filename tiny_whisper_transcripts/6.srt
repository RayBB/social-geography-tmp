00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
[ Inaudible ]

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
[inaudible]

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Welcome everyone.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Good evening.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This certainly is my favorite time of the day to teach a course.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
At 5 p.m. time we start at 8 a.m. so anyways.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Welcome to our social geography or urban geography depending on your exact type of enrollment.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,260
I am bus fan who often don't know me yet.

9
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,560
And I'll be here, let's say, your lecture for today's session

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,640
and next week's session.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,720
For some reason, because I had started the web stream

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,400
on, but not for some reason, I received emails

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,640
from individual students asking for permission

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,800
to gain access to the panop to web stream.

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,760
I gave everyone access until a minute ago,

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,960
now I'll stop.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,480
So because I have to teach at some point.

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,560
So if you receive, let's say messages from your fellow

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,680
students who cannot attend, the reason is that they arrived after five,

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,360
five, and it gets started. But if all goes well, the recording will be

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,800
recorded and uploaded, it went wrong. It appears like you today because of

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,200
the pan-up to technical difficulties, but hopefully will manage today. I might

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,160
close the window at some point, but it might help to get some oxygen in

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,280
here. So feel free to also open windows at the end if you refer.

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,200
Well, it comes with two sessions.

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,160
As with some other courses, we run, especially,

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,320
let's say the big introductory master level courses.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,560
Burbing social geography, urban geography,

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,640
is a traumatic course.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,000
So it tries to give you an insight into different, let's say,

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,480
teams around, let's say, concerning,

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,240
let's say, different takes on urban geography.

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,480
I would personally prefer to call this course,

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,800
urban theory, because I think we do more than just geography.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,480
But the basic idea is to give different,

36
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,280
sexual and analytical perspectives on how to study or how we can study here.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,320
My role in this course and I guess also in my own research specialty is I'm the cultural

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,360
guy so I tend to focus on more cultural issues so I'll be talking you through most

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,720
today and next week Monday to let's say cultural approaches to studying the urban.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,880
Today's session, oops, here we are.

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,360
Today's session is really, you can see,

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,760
an historical overview.

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,960
In the sense that I want to go through some discussions

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,240
which you might know, or either,

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,400
let's say, in generic terms,

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,680
or rather specifically around,

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,600
let's see how, let's say,

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,160
thinking about, let's say,

49
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,560
cultural approach towards urban has been informed,

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,640
let's say historically speaking.

51
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,920
So we're going to go through a number

52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,320
of, let's say, historical steps.

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,680
Many focusing on, let's say, the impact

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,960
sort of thinking about the post-modern asset. It seems like all TATs seems like all

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,960
information, it's certainly in the way that it's not used when this kind of

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,400
terminology except maybe a journalistic media but certainly not academically. As

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,880
been speaks for the last 10 years I wouldn't say that the post-modern has been

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,040
the main obsession for let's say for research but I would argue that much of

59
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,040
what has been discussed from the 1980s onwards more or less around the post-modern

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,360
has already is still being let's say dealt with or no using a different vocabulary.

61
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,000
This is what you would often see is that the terminology, terminology is my change,

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
but if you open, that's adapted more historical answer,

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,160
you will see that some of the even-doer terminologies have changed,

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,480
then that's the underlying or as a content,

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,120
the substance that behind terminology has remained the same over many, many years.

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
So not everything is new, even though you use new terminology.

67
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,620
So today's more historical session,

68
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,920
we see a historicized approach in the case.

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,360
Next week, it's, I mean,

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,520
relatively cold urban cultures,

71
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,840
but they are going to sort of give you

72
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,000
a number of perspective,

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,080
let's say on a relatively

74
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,680
contemporary approach towards studying

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,280
the urban from a culture of perspective.

76
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,640
I will not give a definition of culture.

77
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,760
I mean, I'm not, I mean, so that's a lost task.

78
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,960
It's not gonna work.

79
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,160
and I'm also not going to give a definition,

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,340
let's say media scholars or not

81
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,000
that have given definition on what media is still

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,960
going to do interesting research.

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,360
But please keep in mind that one of my aims here

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,400
is also to, if you decide to adopt a cultural approach,

85
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,480
please be very clear and specify

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,120
and unpacking and operationalize

87
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,640
in your use of terminology,

88
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,160
because it can mean so many different things.

89
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,840
So we have to be quite specific

90
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,200
and hopefully my lessons will help a bit

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,840
to give you, let's say, an insight into the different layers

92
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,200
or different, let's say, lines of research that exist

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,600
and it all used a terminology around culture.

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
So that's what I'm going to try,

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,800
let's say, to bring across two days.

96
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,280
So this is basically structure of today's session.

97
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,200
Let's see how far we get.

98
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,320
It's always unpredictable with slides

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,120
and then move to today and questions of students, et cetera.

100
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,440
But first I want to start with a very,

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,000
let's see, setting the scene,

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,220
focusing on the cultural turn

103
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,960
and the humanities and the social sciences.

104
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,160
I assume most of you will more or less know

105
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,760
what the cultural third in the United

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Social Sciences is, so will not discuss this in depth.

107
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
There are many, many books written on this.

108
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,240
Again, it's a debate, I think that is more or less not finished,

109
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,560
but it has been, let's see, many of the debates we've had

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,360
when discussing the cultural third in the United

111
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,320
Social Sciences have now been internalized in everyday research.

112
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,360
So in that sense, it has become, well, naturalized

113
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
in very literal sense.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,360
That's the first part, very much setting the seat.

115
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,960
Second part, I want to talk to you about post-modernism

116
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,320
and the city.

117
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,760
There are mainly focused on the work of Fredri Jameson,

118
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,600
not because I think that he's the only one

119
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,680
who is written on post-modernism in the city.

120
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,120
He's not even an urban scholar,

121
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,080
because he actually comes from literary studies

122
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,400
and philosophy.

123
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
But his work and his thinking about this

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,240
has been a very influential, especially

125
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,600
because it has been picked up by urban scholars

126
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,640
at a later stage.

127
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,760
Among which, the Los Angeles School of Urbanism,

128
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,440
which is the third section, the third part of today's lecture,

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,400
because they really have worked, you could say,

130
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
with this idea of the postmodern and the city,

131
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,440
and have proposed new ways of studying the city.

132
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,680
As we will see, not everything that they have proposed

133
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,640
was as new as they have claimed,

134
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,520
but still that it has been quite a foundational moment

135
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,960
for the study of the urban, for other studies at large.

136
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,240
To close, now that's closed, and there's a fourth section,

137
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,000
which adopt ups was a continuous partially

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,480
under what the LA School of Urbanism did,

139
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,040
but really sort of broadens it,

140
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,160
broadens it debate and has perhaps been more influential also.

141
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,120
And this is literature that's usually summarized

142
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,440
or determined all this around urban landscapes

143
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,920
or the symbolic economy.

144
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,840
And these are terms that you see popping up,

145
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,240
especially from the mid-1990s, early 2000s onwards,

146
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,160
and that is still a very influential

147
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,600
in our thinking on the city and culture today.

148
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Very last part, I will discuss this today or I'll pick this up tomorrow.

149
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,040
It's what I call "Meaning Half-Way," "Hervan interpology, Cultural Studies," and "The

150
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,600
Spatial Turn," by entry point in discussing New Urban.

151
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
That's in the culture.

152
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,600
This is true as a spatial angiography as a discipline, whatever discipline it might be.

153
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,600
But there was a parallel debate going on.

154
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,360
What we've seen from the late 1980s, 1990s,

155
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,000
all the words is that let's say some of the concerns

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,400
that are in geography or economic geography,

157
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
or human geography at large,

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,400
has had really started influencing other debates

159
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,560
at the same time as human geography started engaging more

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,520
and let's say actively more assertively

161
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
with other disciplines.

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,200
There are many, many disciplines that could be,

163
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,920
that could be, let's say mentioned here,

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,640
but for me, some of the more influential ones

165
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,640
anthropology, urban anthropology and cultural studies.

166
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,640
So where geography is starting engaging more with questions around

167
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,640
and to answer questions.

168
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Traditionally discussed in anthropology or in cultural studies,

169
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,640
cultural studies, anthropology is also starting engaging more with

170
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
the spatial concerns of geography.

171
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,640
So this is something that I will close to this,

172
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
lecture it or open next week lecture.

173
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
And I'm going to first the window.

174
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,640
[inaudible]

175
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Okay.

176
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,640
I'm not sure about you. I'm curious to guys, I'm lazy here. I close the window when I don't

177
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
see it. I'm here in your first time.

178
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,640
I asked one reminder, I have a habit of talking fast.

179
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,640
So, if I talk too fast, just raise your hands.

180
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, this is, I have the very strange habit of talking faster in English than I do in Dutch,

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,520
which would be my mother tongue.

182
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,400
Don't ask me why.

183
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,040
If you ask me German, I'll slow down, but that wouldn't help for, let's say, general

184
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,240
comprehension in this class, I think.

185
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
OK.

186
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,320
First part, cultural turn or cultural turns.

187
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,160
The slides are all uploaded, so in that sense, you don't have to sort of type like

188
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,240
It's really easy to try to focus on the main elements and try to go to flow of the argument

189
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,440
and trying to develop.

190
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,200
Some of you will notice some of you will not.

191
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,560
It really depends a bit I think on your educational backgrounds.

192
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,600
I would assume that those with the social science and especially the humanities background

193
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,240
will be more familiar with this debate than those that say coming from an engineering

194
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,760
background about it much depends a bit on the specificity also which countries you have studied.

195
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,560
So some take-home messages.

196
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
What is the cultural term?

197
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,120
returns, it's part of a wider shift since I would argue late 1970s, at least since this

198
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,000
period that it was phrased as such, in research practices in humanities and social sciences.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,800
So there are various interrelated claims, so that's why I talk about cultural terms

200
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,080
in a way because it's not that easy to identify one single shift in research practices.

201
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,640
One is empirical, and that simply argues, well simply argues, culture is becoming

202
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,560
increasingly important in advanced societies.

203
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,000
Advanced societies being a code word for Western

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,160
Europe and North America basically.

205
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,840
So knowledge-based societies, advanced societies,

206
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,880
post-industrial societies, whatever term you prefer.

207
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,280
So this is the first claim being made as to why there is

208
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,760
and or should be a cultural term.

209
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,160
Culture is simply becoming more important.

210
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
I'll leave open a question what Dan is culture,

211
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,360
but let's just assume that it refers to the arts,

212
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,240
film media, whatever.

213
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,040
So culture becomes more important.

214
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,000
This relates to the second claim, which is theoretical.

215
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,280
We need better theories to grasp better cultural dimensions

216
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,320
of the social.

217
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,600
Referring usually to symbols of fact, meaning-making practices.

218
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,120
The one that doesn't necessarily relate to the second

219
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,560
principle you put out, no change, let's say,

220
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,760
in a beautiful phenomenon, but simply saying, well,

221
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,120
to really understand these holes for now and a better, we need theories that capture this

222
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,920
decultures, let's say dimensions of these phenomena get it.

223
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,280
But obviously when we talk about the cultural turn, often this comes together.

224
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,880
We say, okay, culture is becoming more important.

225
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,440
And very clearly, in order to really understand this better, we also need other theories

226
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,440
because the theories we have don't really capture this quite well.

227
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,520
So that's the second point.

228
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,960
The third point, again, of course, related is methodological.

229
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,440
So if this is the case or also respective of this,

230
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,840
we need new methods to better interpret empirical data

231
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,000
and/or to interpret data differently.

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,280
So either the old data in a different way

233
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,840
or to interpret the better or to interpret data differently.

234
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,040
So it's a time to interpret new data

235
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,520
that we need different methods for this.

236
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,480
A simple example in the current setting

237
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,480
would be if you look at the rise of social media

238
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,080
and let's say data skills, for example,

239
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,000
in that's the last 10 years, is obviously a real method

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,560
that also is an ought to be able to investigate

241
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,240
these phenomena.

242
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,560
So there's a classic.

243
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,160
It's a straightforward example of how new phenomena

244
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,200
has emerged as a society right, and we're not always

245
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,120
able to capture it with the same methods that we had before.

246
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,640
So you might be different skills with that methods.

247
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,080
Again, question mark, not saying this is the case,

248
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
but this is the idea that the argument is put forward.

249
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,440
Because obviously with the existing methods,

250
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,080
you can still do quite a lot,

251
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
or maybe the tweaking ones.

252
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,040
That's important to keep in mind.

253
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,880
So that's the claim,

254
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,200
but also we have to be less successful for classically,

255
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,080
because a lot of this involves less claims

256
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,840
about the cultural term does things better.

257
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,320
But that of course you always have to ask us,

258
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,520
okay, but that will compare to what?

259
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,240
And there's often a kind of simplification

260
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,400
of disciplinary histories,

261
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,200
because then we say let's say within our homography,

262
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,520
it's a, well, we need the cultural term

263
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,200
because we need more qualitative methods before all these old guys just

264
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
qualitative methods.

265
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,240
Yeah?

266
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,440
We're just in data crunching.

267
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,400
This is not what we need.

268
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,960
We need to do new methods.

269
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,960
And there's like, yeah, if you look superficially at that history,

270
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,400
that might be the case.

271
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,760
But if you look more closely, you

272
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,520
will see all kinds of different strands in the, I see, the 100 or more than 100

273
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,480
years of urban studies research that actually come very close to some of the claims

274
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,200
here, made here.

275
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,840
So that's the ethnographic research, for example, took place before.

276
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,320
But it's same, so it really leads to a simplification

277
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,680
of often, that's with disciplinary histories.

278
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,200
And you need to be quiet, and it's quite careful.

279
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,680
The same armaments around, let's say,

280
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
the industrial and the post-industrial.

281
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,640
The post-industrial is not completely new,

282
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,160
no, but attempts to let's say foreground,

283
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,760
different trends that might have existed

284
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,280
at a previous phase also, but in a last, not

285
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,480
in a sense of dominance.

286
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,000
So this is important to keep your mind.

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,760
Yes.

288
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,160
I don't hear anything, sorry.

289

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160

[laughter]

292
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,160
I was very proud of seeing.

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160

[laughter]

296
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Oh yeah, the problem was not speaking loud enough, but I'll see what I see.

297
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Yeah, the building is awful, it was... the building works also, yeah, I see.

298
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,160
So yeah, I don't hear anything what you're saying, it's not just...

299
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
I'm just checking check check check.

00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,160
I think we're going to bring these solar mass here.

301
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
It's all worked quite well.

302
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
The people slowly have things falling apart.

303
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,160

307
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
It's all in match.

308
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
We're going to go here and do it.

309
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
something.

310
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Well, welcome.

311
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,160
And it's all so I'm afraid this is not working on it.

312
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,160
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
That's what you guys are going to do about it.

314
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,160
All right, I'll try to speak a bit louder and a bit slower.

315
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,160
But there's nothing I can do about the building.

316
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
We should be building for your solid 5-game.

317
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I'll be able to watch the help.

318
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Anyways.

319
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:49,160
[ Inaudible ]

320
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,160
>> So these are some of the main shifts that you should understand as being part

321
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,660
of, let's say, the cultural term, the cultural terms.

322
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,960
Yes? Just to give you some quick examples of, let's say,

323
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,960
of the foundational book stat that might act as a reference of,

324
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,560
let's say, exemplifying the cultural term is getting better.

325
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,860
Yeah.

326
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,500
So exemplifying the cultural turn.

327
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Yes?

328
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,700
I'm wondering how people look on this.

329
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,220
I'm not sure if you don't understand anything.

330
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,300
I guess.

331
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,860
Anyways.

332
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,340
Fredic Jameson coming from literary cultural theory,

333
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,100
who I will discuss in some detail,

334
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,780
precisely because some of his elements,

335
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,340
some of his arguments are, let's say,

336
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,580
really foundational things for much of our urban studies

337
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,900
in this particular strand of research.

338
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,620
But you see it also in political science and sociality,

339
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,500
state formation after the cultural turn,

340
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,460
really looking at, you could say,

341
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,980
meaning making practices, state imaginaries,

342
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,380
some terms that maybe now have become quiet,

343
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,900
let's say, natural, really,

344
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,020
to think about what the state is,

345
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,460
but perhaps from let's say,

346
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
an earlier institutional point of view

347
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,140
were not so much the case.

348
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,300
And as you see, many of these claims are made.

349
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,300
cultural and economy after the cultural term.

350
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Yeah.

351
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
It also does not help.

352
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,300
It can stand in the chair, but it really does not help the acoustics.

353
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,000
So looking at organizations much more from a cultural perspective that is not just about

354
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,440
the organization and let us see the functional matter, but also about again meeting making

355
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:31,300
practices, ways of behaving within organizations, anthropology and history, history and

356
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,940
sociology etc. You could name many many of these books but at that point in time

357
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,140
there was all around late 1980s throughout the 1990s the these kinds of claims

358
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:48,500
were made most forcefully in an academic literature. Now to Fredrik Jameson every

359
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:56,740
year I have to check online if he's not that yet. I don't think he's that

360
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,100
active anymore but you would think he was pretty active until five to ten

361
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,980
years ago, which in itself is quite achievement. He is published in enormous amount of books

362
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:12,420
and articles, is professor or emeritus professor of comparative literature at Duke University,

363
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,620
and hasn't come, I'll just put some buzzwords here, hasn't become very famous for Marxist

364
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:24,100
literary cultural theory, for debates obviously around modernity and postmodernity, and also for

365
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,980
the relation to culture and political economy. So even these buzzwords should already give a

366
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,860
a bit of an explanation, let's see,

367
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,660
ask him how you interpret sculpture,

368
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,420
because he has a strong, you see,

369
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,900
marks it, but in a very, less,

370
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,500
it opens matter, but especially this is important.

371
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,620
So we always look at the relation of culture

372
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,020
to political economy,

373
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,500
which is basically a code for capitalism.

374
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,140
So this is, I would say,

375
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,820
I would say is main concern in his writings

376
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,820
at least on culture and postmodernism.

377
00:18:51,820 --> 00:19:04,460
Now, there's a phrase that has become, well, there's also his article, original published

378
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:12,060
in 1984, which he titled, "Postmodernism as the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism."

379
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
Yes?

380
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,940
So this is really, let's say, a phrase that has become very famous also.

381
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,940
You see it referred to on a regular basis.

382
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,980
Now, there are a number of elements.

383
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,660
I don't know who has read to the article.

384
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,540
I'm not going to ask.

385
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,940
I'm not even going to ask who has actually

386
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,740
managed to finish the article because it's not a simple article.

387
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,620
I'm very well aware of this.

388
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,540
It is worth it.

389
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,540
I mean, I have a drink, sit down, and you

390
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,620
mean you understand it better a bit again.

391
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,340
Who knows?

392
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,420
But it really is--

393
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,900
I'm trying to give you also, let's say,

394
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,620
some foundational original religions,

395
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,780
not just about secular literature of artists

396
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:59,780
writing about other artists. But this is an article related to book that is reference all the time. So it really helps to go back to the original, to get a sense of what is on you.

397
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:12,780
Now I picked to do your homework, I picked some as a key quotes from this article which in a way give a good summary of what this claim is about and which shaped I think some of the urban research later on.

398
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:19,780
First he says course, Martinism is not a style, but it is actually a cultural dominant.

399
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
So it is not just a lifestyle question.

400
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,780
No, it is actually something that has become dominant in our contemporary culture.

401
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,780
Second, I am directly related to aesthetic production today.

402
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,780
And this is of course where let's say it is Marxist-state political economy,

403
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,780
the sympathies show.

404
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,780
A static production today has become integrated into commodity production, generally.

405
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,780
So it's really difficult, the argues, to distinguish aesthetic production of production of the arts.

406
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,780
It's in ball, from commodities.

407
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,780
So it basically becomes one, two sides of the same coin.

408
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,780
That's basically what it is arguing.

409
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,780
I think if you start thinking and verily it's quite easy to come up with a concrete example.

410
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,780
I think that makes a lot of sense.

411
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:07,780
A work of art, let's say painting, is at the same time a static production.

412
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,780
It's about symbolic and reading-making practices.

413
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,780
It's about interpretation, but it also sells a yard market.

414
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,780
It's not due to speculation.

415
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,780
It's both.

416
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,780
Then I started elements.

417
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,780
I'll skip this because it's interesting about there's a very, I say, 1980 sentiment,

418
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,780
where a sort of globalization and Americanization was very much seen as one of the same thing,

419
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,820
mobilization was seen as you can see an extension of earlier history of

420
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,180
Americanization. Yeah. And then it talks about it.

421
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,180
And then again, we're not very important. I say, well, basically, it looks at post

422
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,660
modernism as a third stage of capitalism.

423
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Before it was Annas Bandel was a Marxist scholar actually at this university

424
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,820
one of my years ago, which would then be, yeah, use different terminologies for

425
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,540
it. He refers to post industrial capitalism, he first debate that

426
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:08,140
of the multinational capital and the consumer capitalism. So you can argue this all here is politically

427
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:15,780
economically, politically, economically sized, are postmodernism. So postmodernism accompanies

428
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,720
this phase of capitalism. That also means according to Jameson, it only makes sense to talk

429
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,100
about postmodernism from let's say the mid-1970s onwards. There is no such thing, in this way of

430
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,460
reasoning as postmodernism in the 1920s just doesn't make any sense.

431
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,460
Yeah? Because it's so much tied to a particular phase or a particular stage of capitality.

432
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,980
One reason why this article has become quite famous and it's a bit more difficult to understand

433
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,580
now I think is because it does quite an extensive reading and interpretation of one particular

434
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,980
So we're telling, we're just a bonnetman to hotel in Los Angeles.

435
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,980
So designed by John Portman built in the mid 1970s and one of the largest hotels in LA

436
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,660
and to my knowledge, it still is.

437
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,140
So just some pictures.

438
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,340
This hotel for him, it's a bit hard to imagine now, but if you look, represents, you

439
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,300
could say, the culmination of postmodernism as the late logic, as the last logic of late

440
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
capitalism.

441
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,940
So what does the argue here?

442
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,840
You will see some of these elements return

443
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,100
and later the base without reference to the hotel

444
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,900
or the specificity of his argument.

445
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,300
It ispires to be a total space, a complete world,

446
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,860
and attempt to not be a part of the city.

447
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,980
So it attempts to be a world on its own.

448
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,300
You may not be a part of the city,

449
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,660
so that the reflector class here, which rebels to see,

450
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,780
outside and achieves a peculiar and placeless.

451
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,340
disassociation of the Bonavantura from its neighborhoods.

452
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,140
Just keep this in mind, some of these altitudes,

453
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,300
because they will return later.

454
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,020
The other, the separate from the city.

455
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,580
So it's quite easy to imagine later,

456
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,260
and I'll give some examples also,

457
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,140
if you think of, let's say,

458
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,980
gain the community-style things, right?

459
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,220
Things that are, let's say, within the city,

460
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,580
but cities are highly unequal.

461
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,700
So you have different elements, let's say,

462
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,940
separate, even though they're formally speaking part

463
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,780
of the city.

464
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,900
This is what he's arguing at,

465
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,460
that this is what we see in the Bonavantura Hotel.

466
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,380
And this becomes a bit more difficult to imagine now,

467
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,580
because it really is, I think, an experience of that time.

468
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,100
I think we now so used to these kinds of architectures

469
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,780
and these kinds of buildings.

470
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,940
But according to them, this becomes impossible to navigate.

471
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,580
Of course, not in a high-risk space,

472
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,860
a lot of our lives skip that, is impossible to navigate.

473
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,900
It's just too confusing in many ways.

474
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,060
You can no longer situate yourself as a subject

475
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,220
within this world, but you're just very,

476
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,180
a very fragmented human being.

477
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,460
That was a kind of, let's say,

478
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,700
It's typical, let's say, literary trope of 1980s postmodernism.

479
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,980
I think this has probably become less central to the debate,

480
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,700
most likely because we have so--

481
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,260
we have become so used to behaving like this in the world.

482
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:13,140
Again, I want to discuss these details.

483
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,260
I'll skip the first.

484
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,260
This one might be important to remember here,

485
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,820
because again, this shows up and later discussions,

486
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,420
especially when we think about discussions

487
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,740
around cultural heritage.

488
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,580
Yeah.

489
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,020
His story is a space of history, a random cannibalization

490
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,940
of all the styles of the past.

491
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,540
And his idea that especially postmodern architecture

492
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,140
just used different elements for different eras

493
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,940
and combined as into new building.

494
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,180
So it didn't produce, let's say, formally speaking,

495
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,780
something new, but it was more of a reco-lage

496
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,260
combination of all kinds of existing, let's say, architectural styles.

497
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,300
That's a random categorization of the style of the past.

498
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,120
The past has a reference of drag and re-bracketed

499
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,500
reading with nothing but texts.

500
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,020
So this is also, again, something that pops up

501
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:05,940
in later discussions on what does the culture actually

502
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,420
produce?

503
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,620
And then there's this idea that the post model that-- well,

504
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,940
you actually read the post model phase,

505
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:17,940
but there's no linear trajectory if there ever was a say between history and futures just recycling of the past.

506
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:32,940
Okay, now that's Jamesson does that make a bit more sense than what you read the text?

507
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,940
Yeah

508
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
okay

509
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,220
Now I mentioned Jameson not because I like my old almost dead white men

510
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:51,980
But because he really has been inspirational saying for many let's say researchers that came after from different different perspectives also

511
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,580
Yeah, the Mars engine of school of hermies was born with last cities

512
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,400
Let's say cluster or like cluster of activity that came together from the mid-night

513
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,260
It's all worth and we also refer to Jameson

514
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,780
I know she's built on it anymore.

515
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,540
You can see social scientific urban research type of map.

516
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,020
What does the law of science school of urbanism

517
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,820
argue?

518
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,020
I don't think she's struck this idea

519
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,620
that it is a queer and school, but that it's said to argue.

520
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,100
First of all, following Jameson, literally following Jameson,

521
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,980
it looks at the postmodern condition

522
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,780
as a radically new urban condition.

523
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,420
So this is what they call postmodern urbanism.

524
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,940
Main characteristics, again, be aware

525
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,060
Let's say the simplification of disciplinary histories,

526
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,500
because it does have, especially in this,

527
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,220
let's say foundational texts or texts that

528
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,020
try to say really puts, let's say,

529
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,940
the LA school of early on the map

530
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,140
through a number of key publications.

531
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,700
It did have a tendency to then say,

532
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,500
okay, but everything that came before,

533
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,900
in a way it was, it's old hat.

534
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,740
We don't want that.

535
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,100
We need something new.

536
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,500
So again, very, very much a strong sense

537
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,700
of simplification for some of the main characteristics,

538
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,340
itself, itself, and fun.

539
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,260
Beyond Chikawa School, what we see now is not to

540
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,100
see a centric city, but know it's about urban

541
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,940
fragmentation.

542
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
Yeah.

543
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,660
It understands LA and Southern California as

544
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,900
privileged cases.

545
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,980
So the priority case for the research, but also as a

546
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,380
prototypical case, in the sense that the understood LA and

547
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,100
Southern California as the future of other cities across

548
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,340
the world.

549
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,140
Look at what we see happening in LA and this region.

550
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,820
This is what we will see happening in cities across the world.

551
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,940
Yes, so it's kind of pre-figures as the future urban developments.

552
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,900
Yeah?

553
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,300
It made a lot of attention to restructuring,

554
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,540
which was like, say, the generic word,

555
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,780
focusing mostly on post-fourdism,

556
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,100
flexible accumulation, the redeveloped of firms.

557
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:57,180
So we won't go into this because I think you're all aware by now of, let's see, let's see.

558
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,020
Yeah, post-fourdism, basically.

559
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
Yeah?

560
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,400
And there's a nice quote from my Davis,

561
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,860
"Riner and Liverpool Riner"

562
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,840
belonging more elastic to the same scene in a way

563
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,360
where we talked about the LA School of Urbanists saying,

564
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,000
well, they're basically politically economists

565
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,440
with their spacesuits on.

566
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,960
Quite sure the food you understand, what he means it,

567
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,360
but it sounds really nice as a quote.

568
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,560
So here's your sense, it's politically economy,

569
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,600
but it's a bit off, it's something else, right?

570
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
It's a bit speculative.

571
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Now, I already said it's important again to be aware of simplification of disciplinary

572
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,960
histories and it also applies to the LA school as such.

573
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,800
So it was seen as a coherent school, but it was also soon critiqued by others.

574
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,000
And even by those within working within this domain, or that was said, I say, label that's

575
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,200
been part of the LA School of Urbanism saying, well, actually, there's not one single

576
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,040
claim being made by the LA School of Urbanism.

577
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,240
But actually, there's more diversity within this supposed school.

578
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:15,300
So there is a diversity within Cohe

579
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,720
in itself of all the histories, longer histories, but it really came to gather at this

580
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
point in time.

581
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,920
And I think it still shapes, to some extent, to quite the substantial extent you

582
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,840
current research that we are doing today.

583
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,520
So one important strand to absolute shares become even the most famous one is for political

584
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,600
economy, economic geography, I guess. It really looks at post-war and

585
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,360
complex accumulation, industrial organization, regional development.

586
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,400
So really about the transformation of firms, how firms relate to each other, how they connect,

587
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,400
And what this means for regional development?

588
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
The Latinx and the key artist,

589
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
they have to mention that perhaps how it starts,

590
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
the Christoph

591
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
or certain Michael's store,

592
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,400
but most of you will have heard of these names at least.

593
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,400
I heard there was other lines of work.

594
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
One thing we would be this probably is

595
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
to some extent most relate to the first

596
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
and politically calling your place,

597
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
because if you look at, let's say,

598
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
regional development, the transformation of companies,

599
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
there's also an element there.

600
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
What does this mean, actually,

601
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,720
local place conditions, a place identity,

602
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
but it also has to do with branding elements,

603
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,600
it has to do with, let's say,

604
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,520
local patriotism, or it has to do with local labor markets,

605
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,280
et cetera, yeah?

606
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,520
Yes, that leads to this,

607
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,800
the strand I mean, they're all related obviously.

608
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,480
So what I Jennifer Rolf have been worked

609
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,840
on homelessness, on skilled work, local labor markets,

610
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,440
the classic argument in this literature

611
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,520
is that the transformation of the region,

612
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,440
as a result of less of a transformation

613
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,920
of its political economy,

614
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,320
leads to more polarized labor markets.

615
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,840
So we have, let's say, put in a simplified sense.

616
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,440
We have, let's say, higher earners,

617
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,080
and we have, let's say, very let's see,

618
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,160
if not unskilled, and then it can very low pay

619
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,520
and precariously employ it workers on the bottom.

620
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,160
So it leads to a more polarized labor market.

621
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,360
There's also the argument that has been picked up later

622
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,560
by someone like SARS-CAS-SUSPEN, working on global C's.

623
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,360
So that's important.

624
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
And this wraps us, let's, let's,

625
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,200
that's famous but what's emerging now I think more forward force for the last 10 years

626
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,240
is work around environmental justice you know the transformation of the region has also had

627
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,720
effects on the environment at large planning issues but also ecology issues were narrowly

628
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,320
put and this has already received some attention there yes.

629
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:40,000
He said to say on the space of the kind of march to not that everyone would end up like a

630
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,840
name without any of the things that might have happened to the things.

631
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
I'll give some examples.

632
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,880
I'll take later on.

633
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
But basically it's about overfactantation.

634
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,560
We would have to put it in a bus word to this idea that, I mean, especially me, for

635
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,640
So those that are attending my lecture on the European series,

636
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,460
there's this idea that it's a compact city,

637
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,200
there's a coherent city, it's historically grown,

638
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,160
and then there's a lot of actually,

639
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,240
it's opposed to modern city, it's almost inverse, right?

640
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,040
It's just like a chess board where whatever you could put

641
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,600
for, actually, not a good example,

642
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,840
because you don't say, "If I have tier rules there."

643
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,200
But, but you just like a game board where you could put

644
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,040
wherever you want, and this is how the city develops.

645
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,280
Yeah? So, and this is what, and so this relates

646
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,920
to urban fragmentation, and the other one's broad,

647
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,160
I would say.

648
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,400
There must be two issues where they argue, okay,

649
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,720
this is actually foreshadowing why the Roman develops.

650
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,800
And they're not completely wrong, of course.

651
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,680
I would simply, I would just argue that maybe LA

652
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,520
was not the first and in parallel of these

653
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
to be solved and see many other cities,

654
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
where this was also the case,

655
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,880
especially in the global south.

656
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,240
But this is, I mean, that's only a critique

657
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,720
that has been raised towards the LA school also,

658
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,200
because it's only, only on a later stage,

659
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,960
I think, that it started looking outside

660
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
as North America.

661
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,240
You said it started, it was from American buyers, maybe West and Europe, and totally

662
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,640
later they started spanning.

663
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,920
And then of course somebody's theories no longer hold or somebody claves in any case.

664
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Yeah?

665
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Yeah.

666
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,120
So there's a lot of diversity.

667
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,840
If you look at it at the same time it must be set, purely, to flee between the mid-1980s

668
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:27,620
and the late-1990s, various key publications were published that put LA really on the

669
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:34,820
map of urban studies. So this really helps to think to retrospectively look at this as a kind of

670
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:41,540
current LA school of urbanism. Yeah, ranging from 1986 special issue in society and space which

671
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:47,060
is one of the key journals specifically dedicated to LA to books like the city Los Angeles

672
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:55,300
Urban Theory in the mid-1990s or rethinking LA or studies by Alan Jay Scott on Technopolis. There

673
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,380
many, many of these key books that really appeared

674
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,500
that are key references in the field of our studies

675
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,580
that are still a dealt with or referred to today.

676
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,820
For example, Mike, Mike Davis, and I've

677
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,460
said a lot of academic per se, but his famous book

678
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,380
City of Quartz, which again, is continuously referenced

679
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,500
in many different parts of your studies world and beyond.

680
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:34,620
This one is perhaps already a partial answer to your question because this shows a bit in a three, I would say, how some of these artists looked at at city development.

681
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:42,620
I would say in extreme because this is really an article that tries to codify some of the claims of a rate of more subtle manner, but many other orders.

682
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,620
And by doing so, they also radicalize some of these claims.

683
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:53,620
Not necessarily enough in an helpful manner, I think, but it helps to keep in mind.

684
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,620
So they said they argued that the spatial manifestation,

685
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,620
so maybe all the deer and flusties sort of forgot their names.

686
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:06,620
They argued that the spatial manifestation of postmodern urbanism was a kind of keynote capitalism.

687
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,620
So basically, it's apparently a board game.

688
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,900
I wasn't aware of that, but basically a very fragmented form of an

689
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,260
infrastructure in which the code in urbanization is occurring on a quasi random

690
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,580
field of opportunities. So basically there is no longer this idea that you have a

691
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,980
city center that it emerges outwards or that particular structures related to

692
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,580
planning or set or not it just it's pretty random. And this also of course

693
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,660
also the end of theory because if you make this kind of flame that does not

694
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:42,100
really much you can, you can do anymore. So it's also highly that's simplified. So I would

695
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,980
certainly not encourage you to understand this as the core business of the early school of urbanism.

696
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:54,900
This is almost more a parody of this. Nevertheless, some of the last, the items, literally speaking,

697
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,380
they put on the map of key on capitalism still resonate with us today. Because for example,

698
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,380
We appear at no birth, which you could say there's a lot of reaches still going on unless the ethnic

699
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,380
communities, relation between ethnic groups and, let's say, localities within these neighborhoods.

700
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,380
We have team marks, far side, a lot of commodity commodification of public space.

701
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,380
We have community communities without losing place role.

702
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:24,380
We have street war affairs, obviously there's violence in the city, which is a classic team in our research.

703
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,380
Spectacle, again, which relates to the commodification of space.

704
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,380
Commanding control centers, which is, let's say, a classic team of

705
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,380
like SaaSka SaaS centers, I did at Global Cities,

706
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,380
it's already actually happens when it comes to both political and economic rule.

707
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,380
So, all these different elements do, well, we're identified by them,

708
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,380
and have played the portal role in later research on the city.

709
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:58,380
I guess some examples already here. I don't need to go through this idea.

710
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:09,380
So much my summary of the LA school of realism. I already hinted at the fact that this was not without its critique.

711
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:17,380
Some of this critique was quite legitimate because one of, let's say, my hobby or is this really more against the simplification of disciplinary histories.

712
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,380
There's a lot of academic laziness involved.

713
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,220
You want to make it claim that you do something

714
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,260
rather than an interesting.

715
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,060
And by doing that, you say, but that

716
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,500
what came before was actually not an interesting,

717
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,060
but you actually simplify that history.

718
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,980
So if you're intellectually, I think, very honest,

719
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,260
you have to be very careful with these kinds of strategies.

720
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,220
You have to be much more, as the honest and open

721
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,700
and respectful also of what came before.

722
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,540
And maybe moderate your own claims towards newness.

723
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,100
This is not what the LA school did.

724
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,900
All right, so that's it.

725
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,740
Some more.

726
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:51,980
So critics were also abundance and very early on,

727
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,580
raised, let's say, made, let's say,

728
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,040
problems, had the delicious thing had,

729
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,940
raised, let's say, the claims of newness

730
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,260
put forward by LA's good audience.

731
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,940
One being, what's really new here?

732
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,980
Yeah?

733
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,380
You might claim that this is where

734
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,500
it doesn't receive enough attention,

735
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,740
but actually there's already a lot of existing work

736
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,220
on diversity, restructuring, consumption,

737
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,980
into modification or in every poverty.

738
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,980
And especially every poverty has been foundational to

739
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,860
riding on the urban since the mid-19th century.

740
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,420
So there's vaccines industrialization basically.

741
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,660
So what's really new here?

742
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,900
That's the first legitimate criticism.

743
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,780
Second one is the LA school,

744
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,860
it really sort of reduced Duchikago school

745
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,540
to account of Bergus, concentric zone model.

746
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,660
that everything that was written in the 1930s,

747
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,980
which is post-hocks sometimes labeled as the Chicago School,

748
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,060
was about the consent of the solar model.

749
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,220
It's the idea that there's a central,

750
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,980
a business district and that people move outward,

751
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,780
depending on the history and capital also.

752
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,620
Yeah?

753
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,060
There's much more internal of our work,

754
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,020
or there was much more internal horizon

755
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,580
within the Chicago School,

756
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,900
so it does not justify this kind of simplification.

757
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,380
So many of the things that the LA School is now doing,

758
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,020
actually was already happening in the Chicago school.

759
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
So let's say the American claim,

760
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,700
there's of course also a struggle you could say

761
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,340
within LA, within the US,

762
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,380
but I can say, well, we've had Chicago

763
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,740
now we move to LA.

764
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,540
This is where the action is happening.

765
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,700
And then many other odds were saying,

766
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,340
well, maybe not quite.

767
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,180
Yeah?

768
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,140
So that's the board key mind.

769
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,060
A third one, this graph from me,

770
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,980
the most interesting or the most relevant critique

771
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,380
is there is truly, I think,

772
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:43,660
kind of ethnographic voids in a lot of literature and postmodern urbanism. What do I mean by this?

773
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:50,060
It really relies on a kind of detached reading of the city. This is the most, let's say extreme example.

774
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:55,660
This is how we see the city. I mean after his anything more top-down than this, I mean it's hard to

775
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,460
imagine, right? It really is like okay, let's see here. This is how we see the city. But in a no-ways

776
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:06,860
at no stage, do you see any engagement with what people on the ground actually think about the city

777
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:11,740
the delivered or worked in. So it's a very sort of top-down matrix-oriented

778
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,860
reading of the city, which is labeled as an ethnographic void, which I think

779
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,220
is the most forceful treaty. There's a marginalized agency and

780
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:27,260
interpretation of ordinary people. And there's no postmodernism from below.

781
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,440
You could imagine a kind of, I say, fragmented urbanism and the

782
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,840
the political lodge of combination of elements by people making, making do, making a living

783
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,960
in the city and combining different elements.

784
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,280
But none of that is part of this discussion.

785
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,360
And so it's much more, much too doubt down, too detached reading.

786
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,120
Last critique, and this I have to relate a bit to this idea that LA pre-figures wider

787
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
urban developments.

788
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,840
They're saying, well, LA is actually not that much of a difference.

789
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,720
two levels. First, within LA, existing urban theories before the LA School of Urbanism

790
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:12,000
are still relevant to explain what happens in LA. LA is not a complete free, let's say,

791
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,400
boards with quasi-random, let's say, attempt to stay in place. Now you can use all the theories

792
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,200
around, let's say, agglomeration, for example, in order to understand LA or in this wider region,

793
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,780
So that's one thing.

794
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,580
The other side is that the group of phenomena

795
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:31,140
you see in our area are also visible elsewhere.

796
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,300
And not just as a pre-figuring or something

797
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,180
that comes after the other school,

798
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
urbanists talked about our aid.

799
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,140
No, it actually something that was already before.

800
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,260
Maybe some cities were even earlier.

801
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,540
And this I think is also to some extent

802
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,980
where especially research work in the global science

803
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,660
really connected to, let's say, okay,

804
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,180
that's much happening elsewhere,

805
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:58,180
which is perhaps more interesting also and certainly shows let's say that LA is not that special after all

806
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,180
Okay

807
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,180
Wow

808
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,180
[ Inaudible ]

809
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,180
>> Yeah, that's a screen because otherwise there's a lot of ears.

810
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,180
[ Inaudible ]

811
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:45,180
[ Inaudible ]

812
00:43:45,180 --> 00:44:03,180
I would say to me that I would say certain strands within geography this is what you see. But if you look at much of this literature, especially work by people like Alan Scott who's in the stop us and they are all working in the kind of realist vein.

813
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,740
right, in the sense of it's pretty straightforward and favorable research.

814
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,220
There's a world out there that's going to study it.

815
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,420
Some of the examples you mentioned might have happened, but I would say that was more, let's

816
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,900
say, visible or more central to the data in literary studies.

817
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,820
Maybe cultural studies, to some extent, and less so in geography.

818
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:27,740
So I don't think it was necessarily when it came to the other school of urbanism, necessary

819
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,540
much reflection actually on the epistemologically, the pathological dimension, and it

820
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,100
There was more an observation of new empirical facts

821
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,540
on the ground, which necessitated new theories.

822
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,420
I'll call it them.

823
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,260
So I think it's more on that method.

824
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,260
But obviously, as I said, to very good,

825
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,900
there is no such thing as one culture term.

826
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,620
And also no such thing as one post-modernism.

827
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,980
So I think that's-- and if you look at the way in terms

828
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,420
such as the post-modern has been, I say,

829
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,060
discussed with the different disciplines,

830
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,420
you see quite radical differences between what

831
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,540
actually understood by the postmodern in the first place.

832
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,580
They're interesting books written on this also, but yeah.

833
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,220
Okay. Other questions on these first?

834
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,060
Three, was it two more substantial bars?

835
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:22,900
No. How are we doing time bars?

836
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,100
Yeah, let's give it a few more minutes then we'll see.

837
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,620
Am I talking too fast or is it okay-ish?

838
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,380
I think the fact that it has to be very loud,

839
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,980
it automatically slows me down.

840
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,140
So that helps, no worries.

841
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,980
So I might just start screaming in my lectures

842
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,980
and that I'll slow down my temple.

843
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,480
Yeah.

844
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,480
OK.

845
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,660
So we've got cultural turn.

846
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,780
We've got postmodern, let's say, James Solyan

847
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:02,180
approach it and then sort of vision on the postmodern. This indirectly or directly influence

848
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,420
a lot of LA school urbanism work. Yeah I think it was not just Jamesson but there are many

849
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,900
of many of us similarities there and there's a related strand which now I want to discuss

850
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:16,260
with you which I would call as Erwin Landscape and the Civil War of the economy mostly because

851
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,900
this is the terminology that was I mean the difference strands of research but there's a lot of

852
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:27,220
research around these discounted teams which supposedly refer to actual facts on the ground.

853
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,420
So don't see that something really different from the

854
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,740
Yale School of Urbanists is more let's say developing in parallel.

855
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,020
Perhaps also with different inspirations coming up with a bit more I would argue from

856
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:41,380
Leslie Culture Studies tradition which also emerged in the 1980s.

857
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,260
Yeah but obviously there are interactions also so just

858
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,980
you know as a clear catch category we'll see it.

859
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:54,100
If you look at what I now describe as, let's say, one body of literature because for me it makes sense to describe this as a relative

860
00:46:54,100 --> 00:47:01,380
appearance body of literature. There are a number of key guiding assumptions, arguments shaping this kind of literature.

861
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:09,060
One very similar to Jameson, flexible accumulation, post-fourdism and post-modernism are two sides of the same coin.

862
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:13,700
So this is your Marxist argument, right? So there's a political economy and the culture is

863
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:20,700
the supersetive, the other side of this one of the bleecon. But it's impossible to extract.

864
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:27,700
It just belongs very close to together. And innovation perhaps that this literature introduces,

865
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:36,700
according to the much of this literature, says, well, we receive the rise of postmodernism also hanging together with the rise of a new middle class.

866
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:42,500
And this very much hangs together again with just a rise of post-foughtism, post-industrialism,

867
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:48,340
because it led to new, you could say, work opportunities, new fields of work, new labor markets,

868
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:56,780
which demand that you could say a type of worker, a type of population that was overall highly educated,

869
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,540
that was knowledge oriented, yes, this is the kind of debate around higher education,

870
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,660
knowledge-based capitalism, and this was very much seen as it's highly educated,

871
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,640
that this is what they should understood

872
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,420
to be the rise of a new middle class.

873
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,220
It's not your class of middle class,

874
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,980
which perhaps may say more fixed,

875
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,680
but in this sense, the introduction that was done here,

876
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,460
say, okay, this rise of the new middle class,

877
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,060
is accompanied by a rise or an interest

878
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,580
in new university aesthetic sensibilities,

879
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,820
sensitivity, interest, preferences.

880
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,180
This idea that there's a new kind of a static emerging

881
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,580
with this new group of people.

882
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,900
recently labeled and commodity aesthetics in a way

883
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,880
that because it was highly driven,

884
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,900
a variety related to let's see lifestyle references.

885
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,880
Yeah?

886
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,860
So I'm interested.

887
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,180
I'm interested in a little bit of an example.

888
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:46,900
I'm interested.

889
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,620
I work for, let's say, a--

890
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,140
not, I can't talk about the good example.

891
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,900
I'll try to come up with a better example here.

892
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,140
I'll give you an example in a minute.

893
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,460
Yes, so it does really matter.

894
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:03,220
Look, as the kind of examples I was thinking about,

895
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,780
I'm mostly around, let's say, urban street culture, for example,

896
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:09,740
which is very much related to particular lifestyle

897
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,320
that really lead to how you identify

898
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,420
with particular lifestyle.

899
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,380
These lifestyle are close to connected to the buying

900
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,900
and showing off particular commodities.

901
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,620
Shoes, clothes, hard work that you associate with it,

902
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,580
a bit higher up, et cetera.

903
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,740
So let's say the second part.

904
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:32,020
Third one is that culture was key or is key to urban redevelopment.

905
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,160
This has remained, I think, very influential.

906
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,840
I'm doing work on this still.

907
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,260
But there's also this work that was already,

908
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,880
let's say, put forward at the start

909
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,240
being done in the late 1980s.

910
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,580
We've been done on real estate, on artists,

911
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,640
on recresentations of urban space.

912
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,280
If you think now, we've been done on the impact

913
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,760
of gentrification, on city spaces.

914
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,400
How artists play a role in both, let's say,

915
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,240
boosting gentrification, but also being kicked out

916
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,520
of gentifying areas.

917
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,560
That's a classic argument which I was zucan already made in the early,

918
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,280
no, in the mid-9080s.

919
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,600
So not much has changed to the same in that respect.

920
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,360
And the fourth role I think this is something

921
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,560
that was well to begin with, also picked up

922
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,960
more in the European side of discussion,

923
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,200
and which was not really at all really picked up

924
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,920
by the Yali School of Urbanism, is an important role

925
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,560
of the state, staying investing in cultural landmarks,

926
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,000
but also really developing all kinds of cultural economic

927
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
policies.

928
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,320
So this is more or less, if we have to give, let's say,

929
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,040
a nutshell definition or a listing of key elements,

930
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,440
what the symbolic economy literature is more or less about.

931
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:48,920
Few examples.

932
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,280
One interesting article that we have

933
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,560
in the rest of this urban landscape, early 1990s,

934
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,800
where we argue very much along James Sonian lives,

935
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,760
there's widespread agreements that

936
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:06,580
what emergence of postmodern architecture, culture and philosophy in Western society has

937
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:12,000
proceeded in tandem with the emergence of globalized more flexible forms of capitalist

938
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
enterprise.

939
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,360
For a second part of that quote, postmodernism as the cultural closing of advanced capitalism.

940
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:25,600
So this is basically James of all over the two sides of the same quote.

941
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,840
I registered a question here because I would question if there was really that kind of widespread agreement.

942
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:37,600
Yes, there was widespread agreement on this claim within Marx's political economy.

943
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:43,040
And yes, Marx in political economy became, let's say, especially with geography,

944
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,320
it's pretty not dominant, but central to the debates, I would say, in the 1980s and '99s,

945
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:54,720
especially in the early '90s and '90s. And this is part of that explanatory logic.

946
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,080
I personally am seeing much to agree with and these kinds of claims by acknowledging actually

947
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:06,720
that that message cultural expressions are always that easily the other side of the same coin

948
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,720
of the capitalist politically company. So there's more complexity there that is easily

949
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:19,440
let's say simplified. So this is important to keep in mind unless of course your food

950
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,760
the agreement design, which is possible.

951
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:37,800
So the point about the rise of a new middle class,

952
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,720
again, in the same article, Box Office

953
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,360
is a crime used for some real crime.

954
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,960
You know, it makes a couple of claims, which

955
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,040
is not specific to Nox, but I think

956
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,880
specific or represent of La Cides wider literature.

957
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,480
First he says, well, and this is the shift

958
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,600
to post-industrialism, the emergence of new class

959
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,640
fractions under advanced capitalism.

960
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,520
So we see dominant classes, but actually change over time.

961
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,200
But so the structure is speaking, I say this hierarchy

962
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,240
remains, but different class fractions

963
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,640
might emerge to become dominant.

964
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,800
This is what now under advanced capitalism,

965
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,800
we've seen the words of new class fractions

966
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,560
or a new middle class under advanced capitalism.

967
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,400
That's the economic argument.

968
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,480
The cultural argument would be this was also

969
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,520
a generalical reaction against modernist aesthetics.

970
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,640
I say, the children growing up in the 1960s

971
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,840
rebelled against their modernist parents

972
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,720
and thus started supporting different ways

973
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,320
of behavior, different ways of cultural preferences.

974
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,320
It's not wrong, it's highly simplified,

975
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,920
but it's not wrong, of course.

976
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,920
So that's the perceived, the socio-cultural audience.

977
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
Right?

978
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,360
To this related then, let's say this move away,

979
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,780
this critique of modernism,

980
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,120
really refer more to the kind of lifestyle orientation,

981
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,320
which you can look at positively,

982
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,240
or become a part of everyday life.

983
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,160
This is something that's not just something

984
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,520
that is separate from us.

985
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,400
No, it becomes even more radical.

986
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,600
But you can also look at it more critically,

987
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,560
or just become an out of commodity.

988
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,920
It's just a question of lifestyle,

989
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,720
show your identity, showing off your identity.

990
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,520
So there's a lifestyle orientation.

991
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,240
Self-realization expression, and I

992
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,680
need phrase-phosphology, cultural politics,

993
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,360
true sort of culture, you position yourself

994
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,120
as a citizen in many ways.

995
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:26,440
We're looking at the imagination that already

996
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,040
into the act of described commodity aesthetics,

997
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,320
a kind of niche oriented consumption

998
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,400
with emphasis on taste and aesthetics,

999
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,680
and hence an increased role for design also.

1000
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,440
someone I call a mouse, and they never work,

1001
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,640
they specifically focus on urban design,

1002
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,320
or design sector as a central sector

1003
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,640
in advanced capitalism.

1004
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,880
And we can all understand how this works.

1005
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,720
I mean, I think we're all parts in a way of this group, right?

1006
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,280
So I wear this closing, but not that close.

1007
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,360
We can do it exactly the same,

1008
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,000
but just a slightly different color, right?

1009
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,920
I wear these shoes, but not these shoes,

1010
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,640
or I want wooden floors, or not these kinds of floors,

1011
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:10,440
in my house depending on which phase in your life, your life you are.

1012
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,200
It's pretty niche but still we have very strong opinions about this.

1013
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,880
Don't start talking to me about music.

1014
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,280
They have very strong opinions about music.

1015
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:23,320
But if I look at it from a more distance, obviously I have to admit that it's pretty niche.

1016
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:30,280
Yes, so now I sort of, let's see, I established distinctions between what is good,

1017
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,840
bad or bad or not good.

1018
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,840
Yeah, it's pretty specific.

1019
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,320
So I think this is important,

1020
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,600
this is really about this initial area consumption.

1021
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,880
That has increased, I think, rapidly over the last 30 years.

1022
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,800
I think this is not something that we saw

1023
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,920
to such an extent if you would go to the 1980s,

1024
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,760
for example, early 1980s.

1025
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:57,880
Culture and urban redevelopment, for another strand,

1026
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,320
I would say that's really part of this kind of debate.

1027
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,240
Even earlier in need, I forgot that it's this early.

1028
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,240
One of the earliest probably the first book actually

1029
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,240
by Sharon Zuken, who's called "Loth Living."

1030
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,240
I guess most of you would also know Sharon Zuken

1031
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,240
was done a lot of work in cultural and city.

1032
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,240
"Loth Living" was already published in 1982.

1033
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,240
She was early for her time, so it's not,

1034
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,240
you could say not that typical, but it was really

1035
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,240
a foundational book, I think.

1036
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,240
And it really shapes still many of the dates

1037
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,240
that we're having today around the role of artists,

1038
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,240
in particular in urban settings.

1039
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,280
So around law of living, which was New York oriented, and there are laughs in New York,

1040
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,180
but there are laughs in New York, which of course does not apply to every city, but

1041
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:45,360
structure is sleeping. You can see similar processes, at least in larger cities, I would say.

1042
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:51,020
What did she argue? Okay, we have let's say abandoned laughs, empty laughs, and we see a

1043
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:56,180
re-arpegency of abandoned structures by artists. So early 1980s we're talking about here.

1044
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:01,860
Also New York at the height you could see of its crisis, and let's say at the deep end of this

1045
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,860
developed.

1046
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,340
But it's the first thing.

1047
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,860
A re-occupancy of abandoned structures, where ours.

1048
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,540
This is not followed by a new middle class.

1049
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,640
Yeah, so the artist move in first is still rough for a rowdy, but then the new middle

1050
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,700
class moves in and it gets a bit more, a bit more, a bit more, a sea clean, a bit more

1051
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:23,540
fancy, which she calls a reconquest of the inner city, needing to kind of laugh lifestyle.

1052
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:30,060
There are people living in, let's say, dwellings that do not represent your class fill

1053
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:34,380
that point in time, sub-berber, let's say one family household.

1054
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,600
So you have to come up with a new architectural style,

1055
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,580
a new way of imagining how to live in these laws.

1056
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,460
Besides an also become an increasing trade of conflict

1057
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,140
between competing uses.

1058
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,700
Those between alt and havences, if the inhabitants,

1059
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,540
if they were still there, artists, and a new real-world class.

1060
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,700
Where artists use laws also as a production infrastructure

1061
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,060
to produce art.

1062
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,100
you will have last by and large used these laws

1063
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,820
as residential infrastructure.

1064
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,380
Yeah, we worked somewhere else.

1065
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,780
And then culture is also very early on,

1066
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,220
especially even from the early nights,

1067
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,700
the age onwards in New York was used to develop

1068
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,940
and profit from an emergent real estate market.

1069
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,980
So real estate intermediaries, very early on,

1070
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,780
realized that our desardest movie in,

1071
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,860
selling this area becomes interesting,

1072
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,340
becomes visible at the very least.

1073
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,140
And thus we can actually use this.

1074
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,060
We can explore this.

1075
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,580
This is something we can build on.

1076
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,580
And we can start identifying this.

1077
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:36,060
We can start selling this for a project.

1078
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,740
Now this was early '98.

1079
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,780
And if I tell you with this story, it's pretty clear,

1080
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,900
I would think, being all being over scholars,

1081
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,860
that this resonates, let's put it at those terms,

1082
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,420
resonates with discussions you see on an everyday level

1083
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,940
and most of the cities that you are familiar with.

1084
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:55,420
This idea that, oh, that's a gentifying area,

1085
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:00,140
this like a proto defvenation of gentrification or cultural gentrification.

1086
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:07,660
So I think if I think of an area such as anyone Brussels such as Saint-Gio to some extent this

1087
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:14,060
logic is followed. I mean I'm not familiar with too many cities but I see several things happening

1088
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:19,660
in Berlin or so on and still see happenings and saw happening and in many other cities where this

1089
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,860
is the case, quite obviously.

1090
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,580
For this, has been a major strand of research

1091
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,700
for quite a long time already.

1092
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,140
And it has been refined, et cetera,

1093
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,380
but it still shapes the discussion.

1094
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:43,300
So ultimately, of course, there's also, again,

1095
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,140
this has also received research adventure.

1096
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,340
But also, the main set art is

1097
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,700
have become both drivers and victims of urban development.

1098
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:54,500
And similarly, in that time, ours are in development,

1099
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,580
which shows our artists were, well, really,

1100
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:01,740
the early, let's say, the movers to move into a certain area

1101
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,340
and start developing the area,

1102
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,180
to build into development, to love development,

1103
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,740
other types of building development.

1104
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:11,340
But then, when the area, the neighborhood

1105
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,820
had reached a certain stage of development

1106
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,020
and real estate prices, ours then, again,

1107
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,220
were in a sense moved out because they could no longer afford to live there.

1108
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:24,660
Except those perhaps that were smart enough to buy at an early stage, but this was rarely

1109
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,660
the case.

1110
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,660
But then the end.

1111
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,060
So they were both drivers and victims of urban change.

1112
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:33,340
And this again hasn't changed that much over the last 30 years.

1113
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:39,100
Except that perhaps this phenomenon has globalized and it has become a much more strategic

1114
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,100
government.

1115
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,740
Well, they much more than see forceful government strategy.

1116
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:48,740
So this is in a way mainstream urban development by now.

1117
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,660
OK.

1118
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:51,820
Looking at the time, let's take a quick break,

1119
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,580

>> Yeah, okay. Let's go.

1228
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:39,580
So we're still in the symbolic economy part.

1229
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,680
And I'm discussing different strands, or what I mean.

1230
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,320
This is less identified by me.

1231
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,960
So what I consider to be a relatively clear

1232
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,200
and body literature will then

1233
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,560
this body of literature, there are a number

1234
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,120
of different strands of, let's say, research attention.

1235
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,920
So before I just finished the part on

1236
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,440
let's see cultural redevelopment.

1237
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,360
Now in last part within that section,

1238
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,000
I would argue really focuses on read presentation

1239
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,120
of her misplaced.

1240
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,560
Now please understand every strand that I discuss,

1241
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,200
I can only do so much in a two hour lecture,

1242
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,120
in the mind of the Greeks.

1243
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,080
But please understand every strand as potential,

1244
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,720
let's say, lives of investigation for yourself.

1245
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,920
Or a favor for the master thesis, whatever, right?

1246
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,000
Just trying to let's say, hopefully,

1247
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,440
give some inspiration as to what possible teams,

1248
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,560
possible topics are that you might want to engage with

1249
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,600
in more detail.

1250
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,720
So this is also for me a bit,

1251
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,560
what I see as my role in,

1252
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,960
especially for those here and their first semester

1253
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,660
on the first year master, what I see as my role.

1254
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,560
Just giving a few, let's say, foreigners,

1255
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,160
there's a few ideas about what could potentially

1256
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,060
be interesting to do more research about.

1257
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,060
Yeah?

1258
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,260
So one element here is re-placitation of urban space.

1259
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:56,160
This is probably a relatively straight forward exercise

1260
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,760
where a lot of attention recently,

1261
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,060
especially outside of urban studies, in marketing,

1262
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,860
it's true to anything you're boring,

1263
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,660
but still there's not a discussion,

1264
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,760
but we should investigate the role of media

1265
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:13,880
marketing and putting cities on the map. I should say, no one. There's a lot of

1266
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,760
boring research being done in this field. There's also some interesting research

1267
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,760
being done in this field. But some of this is very instrumental. So there's this

1268
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,760
research that focuses on urban images, what kind of interests do we have in mind

1269
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,920
when we think about cities, how it can lead to change geosemages, or some contested

1270
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:35,720
images. And we all will have, let's say, city images in our mind, when we're not

1271
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:39,880
I've got to do the quiz now, but they would ask you to sort of, I would mention a city,

1272
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:45,200
I would ask you to mention the first English that pops up in your hat.

1273
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:50,000
Then it's quite clear there will be a large element of consensus, I think, within the audience.

1274
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,720
Paris, Eiffel Tower, I mean something like that, right?

1275
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,640
So the couple of cliches.

1276
01:14:55,640 --> 01:15:00,280
This has become increasingly important in debates also around urban tourism.

1277
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:05,000
Especially in your experiences, I've always been key sites for tourism.

1278
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yes, so there's the grand tour, there's the upper middle classes,

1279
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,000
aristocrats, European elites who have a travel to and around

1280
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,600
two different European cities.

1281
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,000
But as we come, let's say,

1282
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Massified over the last 60, 70 years from the after world for two.

1283
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And it was really that same to let it's own development around her maturity.

1284
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And, of course, that's it, the whole discussion about her energy

1285
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,400
will also fit in here.

1286
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,400
Yeah?

1287
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,200
This has increased.

1288
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,600
It also been picked up where you could say it was, to some

1289
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,600
extent, firm driven.

1290
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,200
That's the entrepreneur driven.

1291
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,000
This has increased.

1292
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,800
It's been picked up by most local and national states as

1293
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,000
important development strategies for the local national regard,

1294
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,400
which has really really with the focus on tourism as the

1295
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,800
important driver for the economy.

1296
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,800
It's a highly volatile economy, of course.

1297
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,800
This is something we now see with COVID to, well,

1298
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,200
it's a very clear sense.

1299
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,320
It's only everything falls flat,

1300
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,720
and that's for locally cars that rely heavily on tourism,

1301
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,120
that's obviously is quite a disaster.

1302
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,480
You can now be speaking of course,

1303
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,000
socially speaking that's another discussion.

1304
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,360
That is a nice book also, that's why it's a national here,

1305
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,360
not when it's trusted by many people,

1306
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,680
but they are greenback, how, you're outside.

1307
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,680
Branding to the world, how a Sydney crisis

1308
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:32,080
sold to the world, which traces a bit, let's say, the branding of the York from the 1980s

1309
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:40,240
onwards, our city at the bottom ends being confronted with out migration. I can try to reinvent

1310
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:46,320
itself through its images in order to become, let's say, more attractive again. Open question,

1311
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:51,040
of course, if the branding has played the most important role in the city become more attractive,

1312
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:55,040
what's already has played a role in this.

1313
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:01,040
Okay. Last part in the role of the States, very briefly.

1314
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,080
Again, this is the debate that has been picked up,

1315
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,040
both in our mistakes as well as our side of our mistakes

1316
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,040
for a culture perspective, especially in those

1317
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,040
who are specifically on cultural policies,

1318
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:15,040
which is a dedicated field of research on its own.

1319
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:19,040
Which I would say you see a couple of things.

1320
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,160
We see strategies aimed at really developing culture industries.

1321
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,440
I have myself done research on this older

1322
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,360
data around culture industries, which is very much about

1323
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,360
local economic development.

1324
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,400
It's a data that you actually attract artists, culture

1325
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:37,360
workers, to your city, in order to develop economic economies.

1326
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,280
Much research attention has gone into this since the 1990s,

1327
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,920
but especially 2000s.

1328
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,880
There's also research around large scale events,

1329
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,800
world fairs, art exhibitions.

1330
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,040
Again, this hasn't much, much longer history.

1331
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,760
They transcend also, are we studies as a discipline?

1332
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,760
Because if you look at, let's see,

1333
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,200
a discipline such as art history

1334
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,480
that has done excellent work on, let's say,

1335
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,520
art exhibitions and world fairs

1336
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,560
from the mid-19th century onwards.

1337
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,560
Yeah, so the hour always, let's see,

1338
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:11,520
depends to attract the global or is European audience

1339
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,440
to your city.

1340
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,080
But again, this has become increasingly

1341
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:20,600
kind of economic strategy. So you want to attract your Olympic games, you want to attract

1342
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:26,600
a biennial or you want to add a biennial etc. There's also been increased in critique because

1343
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:33,160
often there's a lot of investment going into this but what actually delivers tends then

1344
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:38,200
turns out to be quite limited. And more broadly I think there's literature again from the 1980s

1345
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,160
onwards, why should we do more for the zuchen on the arts and the urban growth machine as it was

1346
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,760
called to the 1980s, certainly, which really focuses on us

1347
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:52,200
seeing art networks, the elite networks, and arts institutions

1348
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:57,040
as local attractors for inward investment and urban development.

1349
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,920
So there's a classic example, if you look at the--

1350
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,320
in the position of the Google Cloud Museum in Google Cloud,

1351
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,680
that's an always-maintured case when it comes to a new place

1352
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,200
museum in the relatively rundown city.

1353
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:14,920
simplifying here and this would really boost the local economy.

1354
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,280
And to some extent it did.

1355
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,480
Again, if many issues attached to it,

1356
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,120
what is not complete before us.

1357
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,160
So there, this is work that has received a lot of attention also.

1358
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:29,920
Here, one more recent example.

1359
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,280
Not sure if the city needed, you could say this.

1360
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,000
It was certainly not around rundown city in a sense.

1361
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,200
Does anyone notice an example?

1362
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:46,700
So it's M+ museum in Hong Kong actually, which actually was just open I think two, one

1363
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:54,200
or two weeks ago, two weeks ago designed by Star Architects, Herzog in the Miron, and a

1364
01:19:54,200 --> 01:20:01,120
typical, you could see an example of a city that is both aimed at attracting and perhaps

1365
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:06,920
improving to the cultural image of Hong Kong, but attracting, let's say tourism to the city,

1366
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:13,320
But also as a kind of advertisement for the C.

1367
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,520
And there's some extent in the very little sense,

1368
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,120
because the main real insight is one big LCD screen

1369
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,920
at the same time next to being a museum.

1370
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,840
So you could actually sort of literally see how this is

1371
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,520
a kind of commodity style, right?

1372
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:31,520
So a very, very literal manner.

1373
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,720
But also for example, big commercial art experience,

1374
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,440
So this is our Basel, who developed, let's say,

1375
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,960
well, which is now staging.

1376
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,560
I'm not quite sure what the current state is,

1377
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,000
because also, COVID really messed up a lot.

1378
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,520
But what it was is staging annual art fairs,

1379
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,800
and Basel, and Miami, and Hong Kong.

1380
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,560
Not only did these events attract

1381
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,640
well-teated visitors by and large.

1382
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,360
Yeah, they also spent there in these cities.

1383
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,720
So again, it becomes a kind of local development machine.

1384
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,560
Yeah?

1385
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,160
Well, recently our Basel also started a so-called

1386
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,040
our Basel series initiative,

1387
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,360
where we try to have events in different cities,

1388
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,280
which in this case, when as I was,

1389
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,040
it's one example, which supposedly should benefit our Basel,

1390
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,880
because it can globalize more,

1391
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,520
but also other things across the world

1392
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,400
would be not at an annual artist,

1393
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,160
and suppose we benefit from us

1394
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,640
in the name of the reputation of our Basel.

1395
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,520
And we see these kinds of initiatives emerging

1396
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,120
quite forcefully over the last,

1397
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,040
especially over the last 10, 15 years.

1398
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,680
Okay.

1399
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:36,560
Last section for today, and I'm actually doing quite well

1400
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,400
at the time.

1401
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,480
So I also won't discuss this,

1402
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,000
unless not every bullet point on the slide.

1403
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,140
But just as a kind of wrapping up,

1404
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:52,560
to reposition, let's say my debate,

1405
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,680
which was let's see mostly oriented within urban geography,

1406
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,880
but to reposition again within the broader debate

1407
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:09,880
on the spatial term. As much of what I discussed, what I showed you, graph of concern, or do you go to graph of concerns? But the spatial term more broadly frames that count of the data.

1408
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:18,880
So, just to wrap up, in the late 2020 century, urban geography was heavily influenced by the cultural term. This I discussed.

1409
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,720
So I related the base in postmodernism and globalization.

1410
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:27,520
This has had to, in effect, let's say the epistemological and mythological effect was that

1411
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:33,720
there was an increased interest in ethnography, everyday life, imaginaries, re-presentations

1412
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,720
or in short culture.

1413
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:42,720
So this really what I think has shaped much of urban geography over the last 30 years.

1414
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,520
Across the social sciences, this is how I opened my lecture of the day.

1415
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:52,440
This cultural turn intertwined with increased interest in spatial configurations.

1416
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:58,080
So that's the urban geography has already been introduced to cultural questions, to cultural

1417
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,440
disciplines, which I would say is cultural studies and anthropology.

1418
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,480
We became more interested in spatial questions.

1419
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,080
So there were a number of reasons for this.

1420
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,640
One is, I addressed this in some other lectures.

1421
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:17,900
there's a kind of really post 1989 obsession with globalization. On one level and

1422
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:23,940
superficial level globalization is the end of spatial questions because

1423
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:28,460
everything is global. But it actually intensified this concern with spatial

1424
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:33,480
questions because it soon became clear of course that it was a process that

1425
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,620
actually had spatial effects and it was spatial process. It was a stretching of

1426
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:43,140
of social relations taking place, which could be and needed to be understood in a spatial

1427
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:44,140
manner.

1428
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:49,980
Connecting A to B as a spatial effect and it leads to a different spatial configuration.

1429
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:54,180
I have social sciences humanities, sorry.

1430
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,180
Yeah.

1431
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,780
I don't want to be able to fit everything on an already two crowded slide.

1432
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:04,500
I had to sort of, yeah, so across the social sciences and humanities.

1433
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,380
So the creative interest in spatial questions.

1434
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:07,380
in spatial questions.

1435
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,020
So this of course, where the geography starts becoming

1436
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:13,060
an inspirational discipline for other disciplines.

1437
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:17,940
This is exactly what happens in the '99s especially.

1438
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,100
Hence, the increase in interaction

1439
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,660
with your own job, your methodology, and cultural studies,

1440
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:23,340
which are already hinted at.

1441
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:29,140
I'm only going to go quickly through this,

1442
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:33,900
but the slides are slightly more detailed

1443
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:37,660
because I added these slides because not, let's say,

1444
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:41,500
the elements I discussed in the previous slides,

1445
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,620
the previous one hour and 20 minutes or so,

1446
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:48,540
cover I would say most of what is relevance,

1447
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:51,460
concerning the culture and urban geography

1448
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,020
over the last 30, 40 years,

1449
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,740
which has already quite a challenge to fit that

1450
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:58,260
into a two hour lecture, but it really misses also some elements.

1451
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,940
So, I mean, I proposed, let's say,

1452
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,500
quite a day in a way, a linear trajectory

1453
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,800
of how previous discussions,

1454
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:04,980
influence current discussions,

1455
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,620
and that had an effect on this.

1456
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:08,740
But in parallel, of course, there were also discussions.

1457
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,280
And I just want to briefly end at it,

1458
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,180
because there's again,

1459
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:14,420
these are almost, and then we've got more or less important,

1460
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:16,940
but we can't really necessarily trace back

1461
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,640
to some of the elements to, let's say,

1462
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,820
Frannie Jameson, for example.

1463
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:24,420
So there are two core teams, perhaps,

1464
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,100
that have also really shaped

1465
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:30,780
into disciplinary urban studies over the last couple of years,

1466
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:34,140
and that we have emerged more forcefully

1467
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:36,140
from the disciplines outside of geography.

1468
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:39,580
But it's definitely that informing urban studies

1469
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:43,140
at large, for me, is a very interdisciplinary discipline

1470
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:46,940
optimistic to elements.

1471
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:50,020
One, informality, second, everyday life.

1472
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:53,060
Informality for those that have studied ethnography

1473
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:55,620
and anthropology, they will become,

1474
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,900
well, it will be quite familiar with this term.

1475
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,720
This, in the story, I give some examples there.

1476
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,980
The religion that looks specifically on

1477
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,340
coming from also the development perspective,

1478
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:07,580
or the developmental lists,

1479
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,380
perspectives to some extent,

1480
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:11,700
focusing on labor markets, precarious work,

1481
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:14,300
migration, legality, political governance

1482
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,860
and conversation, our unpacked this in a minute.

1483
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:20,060
Everyday life, partially overlapping,

1484
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:23,380
but partially coming from where this tends to come,

1485
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:25,900
we're simplifying it from anthropology,

1486
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:30,540
and our company life tends to come from what I would say is cultural studies as a discipline

1487
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:36,700
of the immersion in 1980s, focused very much on agency, community community, women, resistance,

1488
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:43,900
often on local level, often lifestyle, really consumption, identity, media and representation.

1489
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:48,620
So when precisely these terms, those are the newspapers, political rights, there's this

1490
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:53,540
obsession with some of these terms as that they want to critique and then emerge and think

1491
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:57,860
more closely from cultural studies. Obviously, the clinics have never read cultural studies,

1492
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,540
but that's another discussion.

1493
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:07,540
Let me see. Now, in formality, I'm actually going to see it because this has become a

1494
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:12,580
special last 10 years of studies. There's so much research taking place now on informality

1495
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:17,500
and the urban. But it's important to keep in mind that this was already a classic team

1496
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:22,300
within urban anthropology and development economics, especially from the early 1970s

1497
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:27,100
on this. An article always references the one by Keith Hart in formal income opportunities

1498
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:32,660
in urban employment in Ghana and in the title itself already makes pretty clear what's

1499
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:37,220
well, where he stands and what the topic is, right? It is really about local labour markets.

1500
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:41,820
It's about local economic development, yeah? But what did Keith Hart and many others

1501
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:46,740
with an argue? There is a lot of, and I think it's something that maybe she was an ominous

1502
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:51,860
lecture for European citizen or urbanising world also picked up on what is registered to

1503
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:57,100
be part of the economy is only part of what is what you should consider as economic

1504
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,100
activities.

1505
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:03,980
So we have formal economic practices, businesses that pay taxes and that are registered

1506
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:09,620
as businesses, but there's a lot of employment beyond these formal economic practices.

1507
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:16,140
So beyond governments, beyond firms, beyond factories, beyond large-scale economies.

1508
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:19,980
So this is where the distinction between informal and formal comes from.

1509
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:23,980
So this is important to keep in mind.

1510
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:28,980
This, of course, gets slippery because in some literature, this and this comes together.

1511
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:33,980
And we say, well, I actually did formalist illegitimate and informal is the legitimate, but

1512
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,980
that is only partial, but partial, true.

1513
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,980
I mean, we can have discussion about what's legitimate.

1514
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:43,980
But that's, for example, we'll all agree that someone taking care at home of their children

1515
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:45,980
that are constantly exploring, but we do.

1516
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:49,620
I think that both the All-Solary that is not illegitimate to the

1517
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:51,700
contemporary, well, far from it, right?

1518
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:57,100
So where has dropped trafficking is probably informal

1519
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:00,500
because it's not registered as such, but many would also

1520
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,860
consider legitimate.

1521
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:04,300
Again, we can have a discussion on this if that makes sense

1522
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:06,940
that distinction.

1523
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:08,460
But this is how it comes to the emerge.

1524
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,820
And this is interesting because there's one of, not few

1525
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:13,700
concepts, but one of the key concepts that have really

1526
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:18,180
traveled from the global south to the global north. So this is where it worked that

1527
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:23,860
he emerged most forcefully in the research on the global south. And this is what it was

1528
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:28,340
really sort of the travel that says to the global north. That doesn't happen too often

1529
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:33,780
you could say. So I mean in terms such as postmodern urbanism in a way is the opposite

1530
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:40,780
example.

1531
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:54,780
Now an urban anthropology, if you look at informality, it needs a lot of research on opportunities,

1532
01:29:54,780 --> 01:30:00,780
but also precarious precarity created by unregulated economic activities.

1533
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:03,500
So there's strong interest in gender dimensions.

1534
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:07,380
So people are working on markets, working at home.

1535
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,740
So this is really about, let's see,

1536
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:12,340
what the bread and butter of a lot of urban anthropology,

1537
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,060
as well as transnational dimensions.

1538
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:15,340
Particularly this is the mention of the thing

1539
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,220
that has been picked up most clearly

1540
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:20,740
in the more cultural work in early studies.

1541
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,500
So for example, many street founders

1542
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,580
also do transnational migrants here

1543
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:26,980
in a picture of La Amalana and Barcelona.

1544
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,340
So illegal migrants are doing working

1545
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:33,640
on the city, and it raises questions of economic survival,

1546
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:37,020
most obviously, but also questions of the governance

1547
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:41,100
of the political identity of these actors

1548
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:44,020
or the cultural identity of these actors.

1549
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:45,580
And with an enormous study, there's

1550
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,580
a big amount of research, which has really

1551
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:51,300
led to a boom, I think, of research and informal,

1552
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:52,860
and on formal urbanism.

1553
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,940
You know, I pick up some of these elements in my lecture

1554
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,700
next week.

1555
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:58,740
Now, that's very brief.

1556
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:03,780
I mean, I could have two, three lectures for sure on informality as a concept, as a practice,

1557
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:06,420
and how it's picked up in different strands of research.

1558
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:10,420
Just as a kind of stepping stone, please understand this as a stepping stone to, let's say,

1559
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:14,340
the more contemporary research that I will discuss next week.

1560
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:19,220
The second strand of research, which has been much part of us in a forced modern urbanism

1561
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:24,340
drag, this is what we call in drag, is the literature on everyday life.

1562
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:29,380
I myself have been partially trained in cultural studies and everyday life was a concept

1563
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:32,580
that popped up that it was regularly used all the time.

1564
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:41,000
From the late 1980s, 1990s onwards, it was really used as a key topic.

1565
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,100
What does the term basically entail in most cases?

1566
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,500
Because ultimately, it's also not more than a bus work.

1567
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,700
There's a lot of theory behind it.

1568
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:53,540
But ultimately, it entails a key concern with lift experiences of people and the meanings

1569
01:31:53,540 --> 01:32:01,620
constructed by subjects in their own world. So classic cultural concerns, if you wish.

1570
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:08,020
So most of this literature and cultural studies on everyday life tends to also position

1571
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:12,780
people as active agents, rather than as passive consumers or passive recipients of political

1572
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:18,940
power. So this automatically leads to this kind of debate on strategies for tactics and

1573
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:21,380
So the resistance people can have on the ground

1574
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:24,700
in relation to the structures they are confronted with.

1575
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:26,500
Well, they are confronted with.

1576
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:30,700
I'll skip this part because there's also another part

1577
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:33,740
in anthropology which also addresses it.

1578
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:38,980
And this also makes, I think, the everyday

1579
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:40,980
it truly transdisciplinary concept.

1580
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:43,020
I mean, again, there are not too many concepts

1581
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,020
that are truly transdisciplinary.

1582
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:47,260
I try to understand urban studies as a discipline

1583
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,860
that is much broader than specific disciplinary debates

1584
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:53,140
because it's just fairly boring to stick to one discipline.

1585
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:56,340
But the everyday has really emerged from the 97,

1586
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:59,140
97 as it truly translates to an early concept.

1587
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,300
So again, similar to the postmodern,

1588
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:04,340
I think a question that was raised at the back,

1589
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:06,620
there is no such thing as one postmodern.

1590
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:08,260
If you look at different disciplines

1591
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:10,060
to really be at the standard postmodern,

1592
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,300
it's quite substantially different

1593
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,020
and sometimes even contradictory,

1594
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:16,380
the same applies to the everyday.

1595
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,380
when one discipline or one order says about D every day,

1596
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:21,880
might not overlap to a grade degree

1597
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,880
with one another or on the right spot the every day.

1598
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,580
So you really have to look at disciplinary specifics

1599
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:28,100
in order to understand this.

1600
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:33,100
Nevertheless, it has emerged as a term, as a concept

1601
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,440
that really connects cultural theory

1602
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,220
with philosophy, with Marxism,

1603
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:39,500
and Alfred P. P. P. P. with post-structuralism,

1604
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,100
with sociology and with aesthetics.

1605
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:45,780
So the many interesting, let's see, Andrew Porns also P. P. P.

1606
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:49,780
So, for instance, specifically, next to the unavoidable hornet in the favor,

1607
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:54,780
the every day, who sees the every day as a side of utopian possibility,

1608
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:59,780
but also colonize but a commodity form, so that's commodity aesthetics once again.

1609
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:04,780
I can only urge you, and of course, honker the favor is great, we all like him, etc.

1610
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:08,780
But there's also a lot of interesting work that has been done by other artists, which is perhaps,

1611
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:13,780
at least as relevant, let's put it in those terms, than honker the favor.

1612
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:16,340
Please, no, no, no, no more papers on the right to the city.

1613
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:17,340
I've read enough of those.

1614
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:20,180
That's, yeah.

1615
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:22,420
For example, Stuart Hall and Tony Jackson,

1616
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:24,420
classic British cultural studies.

1617
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:27,420
Some of you might be familiar with this over there work.

1618
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:30,540
Especially Stuart Hall, I mean, if not, the readers work,

1619
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:33,540
because it's pretty, well, it's very, very good.

1620
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:35,060
For really looked at, looked at,

1621
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:37,180
as he sub-fulchers, and every day

1622
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,100
as a symbolic opposition to a dominant order,

1623
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:42,260
I'm just mentioning some key words that talk up here,

1624
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:46,420
that we determine knowledge and the thing which has become internalized in much

1625
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:52,140
of our thinking about urban cultures, resistant style, social practices, sub-told use

1626
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:55,600
code, urban use identity.

1627
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,600
Yeah?

1628
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,580
Terminality that was not used for the first time by Stuart Halden others, but they really

1629
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:02,580
theorized it.

1630
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,780
And they really did something new.

1631
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:05,780
Yeah?

1632
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:09,620
One caveat of course is especially early cultural studies work.

1633
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:13,700
It was highly blind to gender, gender dynamics.

1634
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:16,860
Yeah, this was, I mean, the picture shows it was,

1635
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:20,300
youth subculture was very much around male youth subculture.

1636
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,020
Yeah?

1637
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:23,660
This is Washington addressed by a lot of such

1638
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:25,740
as ancient I met Robbie.

1639
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:29,140
It was actually my first huge supervisor

1640
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,460
and feminist cultural studies.

1641
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:33,700
But certainly, let's see, you kind of

1642
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:35,940
underlying trend in the early culture studies tradition

1643
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:38,460
that it was pretty blind to gender issues.

1644
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:42,620
or supporting intersectional other intersection issues.

1645
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:44,580
From quite a different angle, but again,

1646
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:46,980
and they are an amazing book, very thin book.

1647
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:49,420
So he's the reader that's very well written.

1648
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:53,260
The practice of everyday life by Michel de Sertou.

1649
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,580
I'm at the business translation, obviously.

1650
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:58,580
I think the French is maybe 10 years old

1651
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:01,140
and more of any of the original.

1652
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:04,980
More poetic, but maybe folks in practice, tactics,

1653
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,900
versus strategies.

1654
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:09,820
So the idea being that strategies are top down

1655
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:13,220
and people on the street, they sort of engage with this

1656
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:17,060
and develop tactics in order to avoid state strategies

1657
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,740
with mostly government strategies.

1658
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:24,740
So tactics are situated, tactics as resisting,

1659
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:27,580
let's say broader structures.

1660
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:29,540
This again has very much shapes.

1661
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:30,940
I'm not saying that everything is good about it

1662
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:32,140
because it's too dichotomous,

1663
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:35,420
but it's a very influential book

1664
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:38,260
that has reshaped much of the data at home.

1665
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,500
Could next we will talk a bit more about, let's say,

1666
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,540
from the everyday to cultural work and activism,

1667
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:47,820
bit more about DIY organism, where some of the DIY

1668
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:49,620
urbanism literature, for example,

1669
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,740
in listening or explicit and first to the cutout

1670
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:54,500
of stuff that is subtorted already in 1980s.

1671
01:36:54,500 --> 01:37:02,380
Okay, just to conclude, as I mentioned,

1672
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:09,940
The cultural term is to be understood as part of a wider shift in analytical sensibilities

1673
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:11,900
in the social sciences.

1674
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:17,980
I mean at the very beginning I said okay, the empirical theoretical and the methodological,

1675
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:24,900
these are three takes on how at that point we started looking differently at the

1676
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:25,900
world.

1677
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:26,900
Yeah?

1678
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:34,460
So, urban geography itself as one strand of debate within this broader cultural term was

1679
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:37,200
And here's how you heavily influence by Marxist

1680
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,820
or at least political economic interpretation

1681
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,700
of postmodernism as the cultural expression

1682
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:44,000
of late capitalism.

1683
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,520
Yeah?

1684
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,980
You can also phrase differently.

1685
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:51,820
There's very little subtle nuance, cultural readings

1686
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:55,180
of, let's say, symbolic objects such as the arts

1687
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,220
in urban geography.

1688
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,220
For that, mostly you have to move outside of geography

1689
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,920
because it does not have this history

1690
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:05,640
of taking suddenly about, let's say, cultural expressions.

1691
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,600
Which doesn't mean it's not good, but it's limited

1692
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,000
in that respect.

1693
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,840
The work in symbolic economy, and the labels on this,

1694
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,080
but it has shifted attention a bit more

1695
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,400
to questions of re-presentation,

1696
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,960
to urban lifestyles and culture production.

1697
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,480
So the postmodern urbanism school

1698
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:24,880
was, wasn't interested that much in artists

1699
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,080
producing actual pieces of work in an actual art.

1700
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,920
It was most interested in consumption.

1701
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,280
Yes, come on, there's studies.

1702
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,200
you buy something with which you identify as a lifestyle question.

1703
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:38,760
And we see the last part that I then discussed.

1704
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:40,720
We see an increasing or we saw an increasing

1705
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:44,400
a rough question more, a sort of meeting and a health rate.

1706
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,360
Between urban geography, cultural studies and anthropology

1707
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,600
as part of a broader spatial term.

1708
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,520
So this is the funny thing of interesting thing

1709
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,440
is that this cultural term often also

1710
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,040
until the spatial term.

1711
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,520
And it came as the emerge together in many ways.

1712
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,180
The last point I'll discuss is the research and informality

1713
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:04,320
and everyday life and related concerns

1714
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,280
as enormously contributed to a development

1715
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,780
of a truly interdisciplinary,

1716
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:11,280
transdisciplinary form of cultural urban studies.

1717
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,520
I think these are some of the,

1718
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,160
some of you see this happening in social science

1719
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:15,800
and science and science,

1720
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,120
that are not just at certain concepts, just resonates.

1721
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,840
We had research coming from very different traditions

1722
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,080
and then we come, let's say, bridging concepts

1723
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,520
that bring together very different ways

1724
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,000
of thinking very different histories of writing

1725
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,800
And this is where most of them are--

1726
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,560
well, the most exciting stuff happens I would argue.

1727
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,520
OK, next week, this is what I will try to discuss.

1728
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,840
So today, my main claim is history matters.

1729
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,600
So the history of urban studies that I just

1730
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,400
discussed shapes also current research debates

1731
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,920
on urban cultures.

1732
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:51,160
And before strands, I will try this class

1733
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,840
with you next week.

1734
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,040
So it is more.

1735
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:58,440
But I do think that this is pretty exhaustive at the same time

1736
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:02,760
are one on the arts, activism, and urban engagements.

1737
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,000
Just one strand.

1738
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,100
The second one specifically focusing on culture

1739
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:08,880
of infrastructure and informal urbanism.

1740
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,880
Probably a bit more on a culture infrastructure site

1741
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,440
than the informal site.

1742
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:16,160
A third one on urban tourism and consumption cultures.

1743
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:19,720
And a fourth one, which links most close

1744
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,600
and think to the methodological concerns, perhaps.

1745
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,080
It's also as a variable at the same time.

1746
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,760
Folks on sensory urbanism.

1747
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,200
So different kinds of, let's see,

1748
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:31,840
engaging with German beyond the visual and text.

1749
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,960
Again, there's only so much I can do

1750
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,640
into two hours that I have next week,

1751
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:38,380
but hopefully this gives you a pretty good overview

1752
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:41,480
of what cultures of urban research

1753
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,680
and urban cultures can be about.

1754
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:44,880
Okay, I'll leave it there,

1755
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,220
and I'm very fast for today.

1756
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:47,880
Any questions?

1757
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,680
No, everyone happy to go home at quality seven

1758
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,400
on a Monday evening, then I will see you next week

1759
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,800
if I don't see you in the fall.

1760
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,040
(applause)

1761
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,300
(clicking)

1762
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:02,300
(people chattering)
