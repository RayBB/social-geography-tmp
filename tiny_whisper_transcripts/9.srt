1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
to be recording automatically, but it is now.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,080
Thanks for reminding me.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
So double rationality, the rationality of the discipline,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,640
which is taken as some kind of field

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,680
deriving from natural sciences, alluding to laws of physics,

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,280
which apparently help to understand where people go,

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,480
how they move around the city.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,680
and the rationality of the people themselves,

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,280
of the users, of passengers, drivers,

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,360
who make rational, economic choices

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,800
in terms of where they go, how they go.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,360
How does this apply to the city?

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,160
Well, basically the city's approach as a clean slate.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,040
So it's social, political, spatial complexity.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,800
It's seen, if it is seen, it's seen as an obstacle

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,160
to these principles of rational planning.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,200
If it's not seen, then basically, well,

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,440
this planning is applied as if on a clean slate,

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,840
which in this particular slide,

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,440
maybe this is a bit of an exaggeration.

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,800
He's a plant from the Copusia,

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,240
who was really very back then,

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,720
and was called the Boul, the courageous,

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,440
in terms of proposing to actually

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,400
demolish all the neighborhoods

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,320
or all cities to give way to this rational modern planning.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,560
But a lot of these planning principles have been applied,

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,120
I'm sure that you've been to, maybe even lived in cities

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,040
where whole neighborhoods, if not whole cities,

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,720
have been designed according to this principle

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,520
of rationality, speed, modernity.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,240
That of course focused on, or framed the car,

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,240
the private vehicle as the ultimate,

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,840
most rational, most liberating mode of mobility,

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
mode of transport.

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,960
We also arrived last time to this growing reflection,

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,680
starting from the 1970s and then through the 1980s and 1990s,

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,920
on many different problems related to car

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
and automobileities.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,000
So there's wider social phenomenon related

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,520
to a classification and commodification of private cars.

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,600
So a lot of social issues have been raised

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,480
and primarily environmental issues,

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,160
second-rate with regards to automobileity

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,760
with regard to the car.

46
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,440
And to be frank,

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:31,200
I think in a lot of transport debates, whether in academia or on activism or in policy,

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,800
you in Brussels I think is quite apparent in many other Belgian cities too.

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
This is where we are.

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,720
This is still very much the dominant paradigm in terms of how policy is being framed and

51
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
how research is being done.

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,440
Paris considered to be something detrimental to the quality of urban space, to living,

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,840
because of its environmental effects,

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,680
the pollution, noise, accidents, that it causes,

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,000
it's a very dangerous mode of transport.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,080
For those, of course, who are outside of the car

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,800
and clash, collide with it.

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,480
Or it's spatial footprints, right?

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,360
So the spatial impact of the infrastructure,

60
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,200
the amount of square meters that have to be devoted

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,560
to this particular mode of transport,

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,080
nor the for it, to be able to move around the city.

63
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,000
So I'm thinking here,

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,600
but all there have been multiple ways, the parking lots,

65
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,640
junctions and all that that has to be present

66
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,640
in the city for the car to be a valid,

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,200
useful of moving around.

68
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,960
So this is what we did last time.

69
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,760
A bit of an, I'm not an introvert,

70
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
but what happened also,

71
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,480
throughout the 1970s and '80s,

72
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,240
is that in the global north, at least,

73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,920
in so-called developed countries,

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,760
such as Belgium, but also across the point in North America.

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,480
Cities have entered into a post-40s era,

76
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,520
and I'm sure this has been covered a lot by David

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,400
and probably a little bit by Nick.

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,120
And here I'm going to focus much more

79
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,560
on the transport related impact of that shift.

80
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,200
Of course, it was not something that happened over a day

81
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,280
and it's difficult to tell or to pinpoint

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,280
when did 40 cities conclude the existence,

83
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,240
and we moved to post-40 and there's more of a longer process

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,920
that happened over a long period of time,

85
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,640
at least a couple of years, if not decades.

86
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,320
But what's very important there is that if you go back

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,000
to these curves and that are somewhat similar

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,160
to the contractives, waves of different innovation waves.

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,680
1960s, '70s and '80s brought first the innovation

90
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,560
and then the massification, the spread of ICT technology.

91
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,240
So different modes of different instruments

92
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,960
of telecommunication, and also a big development

93
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,200
of aviation of air, which was used both.

94
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,800
I mean, of course, it existed already in 1930s,

95
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,480
40s and 50s, but it's in the 1970s

96
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,320
that it really became a common or more common than ever

97
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,760
way for people to move around to travel, of course,

98
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,200
not within the city, but between cities and countries,

99
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,240
and also to move goods.

100
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,440
So this really propelled or gave constitute

101
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,440
a really big step in terms of globalizing both traffic of people as an of goods or trade.

102
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,160
And that's coincided with a general shift from industrial to service economy,

103
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,720
ongoing sub-organization of not only housing but also a number of other economic functions that

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,840
were traditionally related to them because also moved to the suburbs, which created

105
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,320
polycentric mosaic-like patterns of suburbanization. So the suburbs were no longer

106
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,960
these residential areas from which people committed to the city center, but actually a lot of jobs,

107
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,280
a lot of productive activity and service economy would start being located in the suburbs themselves.

108
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,480
So creating all kinds of constellations, which for example could be called the suburban downtown,

109
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,000
so H-Cities that comes from the work of a famous job of a soldier,

110
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,960
analyzing the development of Los Angeles in the 1980s and the 1990s.

111
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:17,080
The paradigm of this could be seen, I mean, or the symbol, not a paradigm of this transformation

112
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,560
could be seen in the particular space or a type of space of an airport. If back in the 1970s,

113
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,760
as you can see in this image, the airport would be a very functional place, a place of arrival,

114
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:36,760
the departure and around the small area would be devoted to the airport. This over, of course,

115
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,240
a number of decades has completely changed. So you see that development of one of the most

116
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,040
important efforts in the world's people, which is the airport of Amsterdam. What's very important

117
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:54,280
here is that the airport is no longer in addition to the city but actually increasingly a central

118
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,160
space around which or in relation to which the city develops.

119
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,320
So what kind of a city has, what kind of an upwards city has,

120
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,680
has repercussions in terms of what kind of class of investors

121
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,040
and productive activities it can attract.

122
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,820
To have an important airport hub is increasingly

123
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,040
only, well, it's already a well-established point

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,960
of the agenda of open marketing of open development.

125
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,200
And airports are no longer just airports.

126
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,480
when you can see here in the slide that around C-pop,

127
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,000
we've got a number of other activities.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So business district, office spaces, residential hotel.

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,640
So it is sort of neighborhood in itself

130
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,760
that is built around the airport itself.

131
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,840
This is important, why is it important?

132
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,120
Well, there is a number of things at stake here,

133
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,240
but the most important thing here is that this change

134
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,640
of typology of different spaces and relation to these different modes of travel.

135
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,240
So, coming into telecommunications, aviation means that travel patterns are becoming more

136
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,880
and more complex.

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,000
The globalization of world economy and the centrality of the city and global economy means

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,120
that there is a number of productive activities jobs basically that have in 24/7.

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,440
It's the paradigm of going to, I mean, of most people going to work at eight o'clock,

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,600
in the morning and then going back in the afternoon, of course, it's a lot of people still

141
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,880
do that, but there is plenty of jobs that happen overnight that require transporting

142
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,040
infrastructure that is provided in places and at times that were not needed, there was no

143
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:44,760
demand for in the past. So in other words, this making of the urban economy more flexible

144
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,720
and more precarious has repercussions in terms of making transport and mobility also much

145
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,040
much more flexible or the demand for, much more flexible,

146
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,720
way of moving, which of course means that it's way more complicated and way more difficult

147
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,640
to design transport systems than before.

148
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,520
Since people move, if we can put it in a very blunt way, in much more complicated ways than

149
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,080
ever before, at very different times, in different spaces.

150
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,120
Just to give you an example, I mean, traditionally, there's haven't been, so the

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,840
airport of Brussels will be considered, of course, as a very important space that had to

152
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,520
be connected to the city, primarily to receive passengers

153
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,560
there and from.

154
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,000
And increasingly, around that area of the city--

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,120
and I think you covered that with David, quite in detail--

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
there is a whole hub of business and productive activity,

157
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,360
which of course attracts a lot of middle class workers

158
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,360
who would go to that area daytime.

159
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,440
But then the development of the city--

160
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,840
sorry, of the airport--

161
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,440
means that there is a high demand for workers

162
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,640
and logistics, for example.

163
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,240
I have to arrive at the airport at 3 o'clock in the morning, which raises questions in terms of provision of public transport to the area.

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,240
A lot of these people would, for example, reside in working-class neighborhoods of Brussels.

165
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,940
So there is a question where the night-time public transport should be provided to the area,

166
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,140
but then get the current paradigm of public transport by nighttime in Brussels.

167
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,640
This mode of transport is mostly provided for leisure activities.

168
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,000
So for people who go out and enjoy cultural activities

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
or socializing and want to go back home

170
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,560
and do a clock three o'clock in the night.

171
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,520
But not for people who actually need to reach

172
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,240
they jobs at that time of the night.

173
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,440
In very, let's say weird or previously

174
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,880
not so present areas such as the sub-item area

175
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,720
or other locala fees around that and that's not that hard.

176
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,040
Okay.

177
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,000
So having said this,

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,960
So a quick reminder of what we did last time

179
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,920
and a quick cover of this shift from four this to post four

180
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,120
is the paradigm of urban development

181
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,840
and its repercussions for the cities

182
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,400
and transport in them.

183
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,520
Here's what we are going to do today.

184
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,040
So we will discuss perhaps have a little discussion.

185
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,280
Actually, I'll be trying to ask you some questions

186
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,040
and engage in some exchange here.

187
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,320
What is the sustainable urban transport

188
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,760
different sustainable perspectives on imagining transport and developing it.

189
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,360
And then we will engage in a progressive deconstructing of the paradigm and analyze what we

190
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,080
can identify as critical approaches to transport it, mobility that built on a number of

191
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,480
perspectives that you already heard from David and Bass and Nick about.

192
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,680
All right.

193
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,400
Last week, what you had to do, and many other things that are done out of you had to do

194
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,280
with students of Master of Nursing Studies and Geography,

195
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,840
is to read paper by David Bannister on Sustainable Mobility

196
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,120
Partly.

197
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,840
I wonder whether you still remember anything from that paper.

198
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,080
This is not an exam, so don't worry if you remember things

199
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,040
that were not exactly what you remember,

200
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
but it's exactly clear, maybe things a little bit fuzzy.

201
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,560
But does something ring a bell from that piece?

202
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,880
If somebody asked you today before this particular lecture,

203
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,320
what is sustainable urban transport?

204
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,480
What comes to mind?

205
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,680
Does anybody want to share the thoughts on this with us?

206
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:19,240
That's a cool look with silence.

207
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,040
Come on, does anybody remember what

208
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,440
a banister says in this paper?

209
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,000
That's all right.

210
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,640
Okay, well, it's not how to put it.

211
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,280
It's not the most fascinating paper I've ever read,

212
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,040
but for transport geography, it's absolutely fundamental.

213
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,000
So this is really something that you see being referred

214
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,440
to for what was it written 2011, right?

215
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,440
So nine years in this is still a very, very important piece

216
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,960
of writing that really defined almost a whole field

217
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,880
of research and transport in mobility.

218
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,040
What's important here-- and this is important when

219
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,760
we keep thinking about the last lecture

220
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,280
in the neoclassical paradigm of developing transport--

221
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,760
is, well, could be summarized in the number of parts.

222
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,880
So if you think about this image that I showed you

223
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,160
from the corpus year, and this modernist rational approach

224
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,560
to planning cities around transport,

225
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,180
Here, the assumption is that we have to ultimately break with the small

226
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,700
function of planning, separation of functions, keeping residential areas on the one side,

227
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,100
and productive activity jobs, offices, industrial activity,

228
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,540
on the other side, and then leisure somewhere in between these three,

229
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,660
in between these two. Here, the idea is that we really have to

230
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,980
engage in planning cities that are much more mixed, which different functions are

231
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,660
allocated much more closely to each other. Why do we have to do that? Well, because this increases

232
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:13,260
a possibility of engaging less in mobility, of basically moving less in the city, which has of course

233
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,420
very good implications or potentially good implications in terms of the environmental impact of

234
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,940
transport. So the idea is that if we make cities more mixed, in terms of the functions, and on

235
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,460
top of that more dense, we might arrive at a situation in which people don't have to travel such

236
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,500
for our distances, all they don't have to travel that often.

237
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,820
And potentially, and that's the second point,

238
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,780
we can also facilitate some kind of a shift

239
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,580
from the mode that we all want to disappear.

240
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,380
I'm thinking as a sustainable urban transport plan

241
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,820
right now.

242
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,900
So the car towards public transport, collective mobility,

243
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,380
on the one hand, and on the other hand,

244
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,980
so-called soft transport mode.

245
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,660
So walking, cycling, to profoundly challenge

246
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,660
and hopefully end the domination of class in cities.

247
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,660
So this is, it goes beyond the critique of the car.

248
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,660
How do we, maybe not get rid of the car,

249
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,660
but how do we limit its presence?

250
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
Well, we make cities more dense, more mixed,

251
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,660
and we make public transport

252
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,660
and other different modes of moving around more attractive.

253
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,660
Well, of course, there are important cultural

254
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,660
and social barriers to this.

255
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,660
So there is some kind of social inertia

256
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,760
and you mentioned it in our discussion at the end of the last lecture,

257
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,140
people are used to driving.

258
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,580
They, of course, had been also told for a couple of decades.

259
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,380
Now that I mean buying a car is something not only perfectly normal,

260
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,100
but maybe in context such as Belgium or Brussels,

261
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,180
a perfectly rational choice.

262
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,780
Also, well, if we follow the neoclassical line,

263
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,260
I mean people make rational economic choices.

264
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:53,100
It's been simply quite profitable and economically reasonable to have a car.

265
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,260
So to instigate some kind of a social transformation,

266
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,780
we need to pay more attention to how people make these choices.

267
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,500
And this perspective starts adding a number of psychological analysis, for example,

268
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:12,220
in fact, to this equation. So it's not only an economic choice in some kind of an economic

269
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,300
decision that people make when they take a car or some other amount of transport,

270
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:23,260
But there's also different social aspects, psychological aspects that impact,

271
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,540
that make an impact on this. And this means that sustainable urban transport scholars, planners,

272
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,220
activists are much more attentive than the neoclassical colleagues in terms of how people

273
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,940
engage in different lifestyles, why do they practice certain travel behaviors that is called,

274
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,500
which also leads to a lot of studies on inclusion and transport or exclusion from it on accessibility,

275
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,860
the two different transport modes or accessibility

276
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,380
through transport to different urban functions,

277
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,180
which progressively over the 1990s, 2000s,

278
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,620
and after today, questions this paradigm of seems

279
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,420
to question this paradigm of top down planning and policy.

280
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,780
So this figure of some neoclassical rational expert

281
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,980
is not necessarily what it's still there,

282
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,940
but it's not the only god-like figure

283
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,860
that made these liquor who see a life decisions

284
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,060
in terms of, here we will go the motorway,

285
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,260
and here we will build some residential neighborhood

286
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,100
et cetera et cetera.

287
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,980
Where is the city in this paradigm or in this perspective?

288
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Well, the city is an outcome of the sustainable

289
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,540
transport paradigm.

290
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,060
It's a sustainable transport in sustainable city

291
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:46,060
is an integral component of what Jacob's calls good city

292
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,820
or what David Bannister in the article he had to read,

293
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,820
identifies as urban viability, vibrancy, vitality.

294
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,340
There is a lot of words about a lot of writing about

295
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,460
the attractiveness of the city or its livability

296
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,900
or its resilience, that's a bit more recent.

297
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,900
So there's a lot of keywords which identify a city as

298
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,180
ultimate benefactor of this shift

299
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,700
towards sustainable transport.

300
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,060
So there is talk about maintaining economic performance

301
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,140
of the city since, well, we remember that

302
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,860
new classical scholars have essentially tried

303
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,700
to theorize this relationship between economic growth

304
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,180
and development of transport.

305
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,020
So it's still there.

306
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,220
We move away from the carbon.

307
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,660
So the cities still continue to develop.

308
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,620
The economy is continue to thrive.

309
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,380
which you've social cohesion so presumably everybody is on board,

310
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,220
there is no loses of this process.

311
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,340
It's all, of course, environmentally friendly.

312
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,940
We arrive at urban environments which provide better health

313
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,540
environments or not facilities, but basically more healthy

314
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,260
for the residents.

315
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,940
And all this in the spirit of participation,

316
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,980
so everybody is on board and this political process

317
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,060
does not exclude anybody.

318
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,340
Well, if you think about this, I mean,

319
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,020
I'm, no, my intention is not to be ironic here.

320
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,300
I think that, by the way, the slide,

321
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,620
I mean, the image here is from this visualization

322
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,220
of Boula Varnspak in Brussels,

323
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,180
so the central avenue that crosses the Pentagon

324
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,620
from North to South.

325
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,740
And if you remember how this street looked like

326
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,820
some years ago, this kind of vision is something

327
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,660
that we might all want to subscribe to.

328
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,100
I mean, who doesn't want to live in a city that is all these things economically performing

329
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,000
and socially cohesive environment friendly?

330
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,020
I mean, it's a perfect city to see.

331
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:47,220
The problem is, well, before we move to the problem, there are a few.

332
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,580
I'm sure that this rings a bell, and I'm sure that you know a lot of different practices

333
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,860
which are trying to policies, practices that are trying to achieve these things to make

334
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,300
the city more environmentally friendly in terms of its transport, economic performance,

335
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:06,940
inclusive, cohesive and whatnot. I am curious what examples you know. So this is maybe an

336
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,340
easy question to answer compared to the previous one. Does anybody know any practices of sustainable

337
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,260
transport, basically? Is it my question?

338
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:24,060
Could you consider the construction of bike lanes, for example?

339
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:32,220
Yes, very much so. I mean, it's promoting a different mode of transport than the cars, right?

340
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,340
One of the soft modes cycling. So we absolutely yes.

341
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,860
What else?

342
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:45,820
I see it, Antwerp. I'm leaving

343
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,500
here next to it, about 1 kilometer of the opera in Antwerp.

344
00:20:52,460 --> 00:21:01,700
And two years ago, it was for passengers.

345
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,780
Very difficult to cross the roads.

346
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,220
And now they made a tunnel.

347
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,980
And they made a huge space for COVID transport and passengers.

348
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:19,060
So you can see now, and then a big difference,

349
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,660
a clear division from what's what's unusual until the 90s.

350
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:30,420
So you mean that there was less space of well, the current

351
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,460
for starting to be a

352
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,300
is now the human life by public transport to the world.

353
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,580
Yeah.

354
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,780
The the car was still

355
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,740
like they said it was the boss.

356
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,100
Right.

357
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,100
of the car was very important.

358
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,100
We see now we shift there.

359
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,100
And the shift basically consists of creating some infrastructure for pedestrians

360
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,100
and public transport to somehow buy.

361
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,100
Now for a meeting place for the opera.

362
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Okay, okay.

363
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Okay, very often.

364
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Just to this.

365
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Can you hear him?

366
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,220
Yeah, I just just right before the lecture I read about Paris with a more

367
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,180
restrictive policy about banning

368
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:27,180
There are parking spots in cities in in order to achieve the 50 minutes city the so-called

369
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Human city air right so restricting

370
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:39,500
Restructing current infrastructure or transforming it into different type of infrastructure for either either different modes or for pedestrians

371
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,500
So creating some urban space, okay.

372
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
What else?

373
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Maybe developing bus rapid transit.

374
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
That's not all that in America.

375
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Yeah. Does everybody, or is this somebody who doesn't know what bus rapid transit is?

376
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:01,500
It's a funny question to ask to a screen, but, oh, you know,

377
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,500
we don't tell me that it's switched again.

378
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
I have to stop sharing this screen, but perhaps you want to explain what bus rapid transit is,

379
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I'm sure that there is somebody who doesn't know.

380
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,500
I can help in case your definition is not perfect.

381
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Well, what it has.

382
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Yeah, you know, what I have as an example is this lanes that they're just for bosses.

383
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,500
So they're developed a rapid lane that it will only go for bosses.

384
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,500
It's supposed to work better around the city.

385
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:53,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's essentially creating separate lanes for buses, but what's quite specific about this or quite particular is that it kind of imitates or replaces an underground system, so a metro system, which is of course very expensive to build.

386
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:03,300
So the idea is that instead of engaging in all this digging and creating this very costly and invasive infrastructure, you can just create some separate lanes for the buses and have an efficient.

387
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,260
public transport system which is metro like.

388
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,300
And that's, I want to say common, but well, a lot of cases first emerge in the global

389
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
south, right?

390
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,380
So in South America and in South Africa, but there are also cases in global, in

391
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,820
the global north and western European.

392
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:29,140
Okay, there is a lot of these different policies and a lot of different, a lot of different

393
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,420
practices and ideas.

394
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,740
It seems.

395
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,420
So let's quickly go over, let's try to put them together

396
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,100
into some kind of coherent typology of different things

397
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,100
that cities can do in order to make this transport

398
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,260
more sustainable.

399
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,660
So the first thing is to tackle the problem, right?

400
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,100
So if the problem is the car, then how do we deal with the car?

401
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,140
Well, we can either improve the technology of the car.

402
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,420
And this means reducing emissions,

403
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,860
making it contaminate the little bit less.

404
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,180
So cleaning the engine technology,

405
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,900
substituting for of petrol,

406
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,820
these are vehicles by electric vehicles or biogas,

407
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,380
or whatnot.

408
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,260
Creating the construction of cars

409
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,980
so that they cause less casualties in case of accidents.

410
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,260
So this is something that today we take for granted

411
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,100
that cars have these crash zones

412
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,420
and crashes are being done in safety tests.

413
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,740
But this was virtually non-existent in the 1970s or '80s.

414
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,660
So that's one thing.

415
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,100
So basically it's trying to make the car

416
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,460
a better vehicle for the city.

417
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,460
Well, here, the immediate problem is that I mentioned

418
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,980
that last time among the type of vehicles

419
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,180
that see the number of sales go up.

420
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,180
Most, I mean, most rapidly in the last two or three years,

421
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,580
our SUVs, the sports utility vehicles,

422
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,540
which are basically these massive Jeep-like cars

423
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,620
which are extremely dangerous for pedestrians.

424
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,940
And if you also turn to one of the most important

425
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,500
or marketised inventors of transport technology, Elon Musk.

426
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,420
I mean, it's a guy who does electric cars, but also if you paid attention to that,

427
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,300
I don't know if you noticed that in the news.

428
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,300
I think it was early this year or last year that he produced this massive truck,

429
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:21,260
like American style pickup truck, which has not been tested in terms of its impact on

430
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,300
pedestrians in case it actually clashes with one. But there is, on the one hand, the industry

431
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,020
tries to reinvent the vehicles to make them more safe and very many friendly. On the other hand,

432
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:37,020
there is still a push for creating gigantic vehicles which simply cannot achieve that with the size

433
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:43,420
and the you know it's audience or the audience not simply looking for this. Okay so that's the car.

434
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,900
And the other thing that of course can be done is to restrict the accessibility for the car

435
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:55,900
to the city as a whole or to its different area specific zones right. So we can

436
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,460
And for example, imposed these destructive pricing instruments,

437
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,580
such as congestion charging or perage,

438
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,980
which was a more stud stolen and Dutch,

439
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,940
which was very recently announced in Brussels,

440
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,700
but it existed in several other Belgian cities

441
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,140
in one form or another for quite a while now.

442
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,900
We can think of reducing physically the space for the car,

443
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,820
so basically making roads more narrow,

444
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,100
so cutting some lanes,

445
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,580
reducing the number of parking areas.

446
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,140
And then, as it was mentioned earlier,

447
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,540
replacing this infrastructure,

448
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,540
replacing this space with other uses.

449
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,620
So opening this space, too, for example,

450
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,860
pedestrians will non-motorize traffic,

451
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,980
creating these so-called pedestrian zones,

452
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,340
or shared spaces.

453
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,980
And here have one from London in this slide.

454
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,740
And also, the famous congestion charging steam in London,

455
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,340
which means that in a specific central area of London,

456
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,660
you pay 12 pounds to enter every time you do that, right?

457
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,140
Okay, what other things can be done

458
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,380
to tackle a lot of mobility?

459
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,780
Well, of course, if we want the presence of the car to go down,

460
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,460
we need to propose some alternative to the car.

461
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,180
Our obvious alternative is public transport,

462
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,220
and here's sustainable perspectives on transport basically

463
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,620
keep emphasizing the importance of increasing the quality

464
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,460
of public transport,

465
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,980
increasing the accessibility of public transport across the urban or suburban space.

466
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:30,260
And indeed, faster rapid transit is one common example of how this can be done actually

467
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:36,580
quite inexpensively. Also, the reinstallational urban trumps in many cities in the global north

468
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:42,740
that got rid of the tram to create space for the car. If you remember my slides from last

469
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:48,660
time, that's what partly happened in Brussels in the 1970s. It's a very common way. It was a very

470
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,980
common phenomenon, common phenomenon, sorry. In France where a lot of cities,

471
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,580
tramphet work was quite simply dismantled. So here, since the 1990s, 2000s,

472
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,180
we see the return of the tramp. Urban for the finicular, so gradient,

473
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,580
skable cars, plenty of other modes, basically, of public transport. And also

474
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,460
promoting the notion of multi-modality, right? So creating different options for

475
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,780
users so that they don't have to simply choose between the car and something else,

476
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,820
but there's something else is a variety of different options from which one can choose,

477
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:27,300
depending on where they go with whom, what they feel like using in a particular moment of time,

478
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:33,300
what corresponds better to the behavior to the lifestyle, right? If the lifestyle and behavior

479
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:42,100
is what we pay attention to much more than before. And then finally, what's important in this

480
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,500
and port volume of different solutions or tools,

481
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,180
if you will, is reducing the need to travel.

482
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,420
So I mentioned already that here the idea

483
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,100
is that we make cities more dense, more mixed.

484
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,860
So perhaps we don't have to travel so often and so far.

485
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,660
And in planning for geography,

486
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,620
the idea here is to progressively

487
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,420
linked urban development with transport development.

488
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,500
So the idea of transit oriented or transport

489
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,060
the development emerged within this paradigm.

490
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,900
So for example, fostering some activities

491
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,460
and development around the development

492
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,780
of new metro stations or railway stations

493
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,780
or whole transport corridors.

494
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,580
A little bit like what I showed you last time

495
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,420
with COVID-19, right?

496
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,380
The finger, the five finger plan,

497
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,780
which was one of the first ideas

498
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,700
of linking transport development

499
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,380
at urban development.

500
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,980
And many other things that, well, quite frankly,

501
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,300
I'm much more interested in sharing with you

502
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,740
the critique of all this, then this itself.

503
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,060
Because this is very easy to find this plenty

504
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,500
of different publications on this.

505
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,780
I mean, basically, if you follow any of these websites

506
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,100
which deal with, well, these are called magazine

507
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,620
these days, follow urban policy, city lab,

508
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,020
the Atlantic, Fox, or whatnot, sure that you know

509
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,900
more than I do.

510
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,060
I mean, this is what they say.

511
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,380
I mean, this is what they promote a lot, right?

512
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,060
So the car is the problem.

513
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,060
So any time a big northern, also in the global south,

514
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,580
this is picked up a little bit.

515
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,500
But any time any city,

516
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,140
an important city does something in terms of curving

517
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,260
or vulnerability,

518
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,180
this is very often picked up at this kind of media

519
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,180
and hailed as a radical intervention,

520
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,340
as a radical step to reinvent the ability

521
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,420
to give cities back to the people,

522
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,100
to make cities more sustainable green attractive,

523
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,660
et cetera, et cetera.

524
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,500
Now, I'm not saying that this is all bad

525
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,860
and that this is problematic in itself.

526
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,900
But there is a number of critical questions

527
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,460
that ask us critical geographers

528
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,580
really need to be asking about these practices,

529
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,180
because they're quite simply, well,

530
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,660
they are not really taking full stock

531
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,820
of the complexity of cities that they're being applied

532
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,260
for one.

533
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,500
So, well, the first immediate problem

534
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,700
is that the word sustainability

535
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,900
or the term sustainability has already been picked up

536
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,900
by the industry, the paradigm, that sustainability,

537
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,980
in principle, wanted to criticize

538
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,620
and to have some critical cutting edge over.

539
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,740
So for instance, the oil industry

540
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,460
and the current industry, both claim to be extremely sustainable

541
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,100
these days, in terms of how they produce soil,

542
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,740
and in terms of how they produce vehicles.

543
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,900
I mentioned already this idea of reinventing the car,

544
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,020
which is a more sustainable mode of travel in cities.

545
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,860
But the deeper problem is that, and I will show that in a moment,

546
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:44,500
that the kind of questions that sustainable urban paradigm asks about the city

547
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,100
and the solutions that it tries to bring are essentially,

548
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:53,180
I mean, they can only reveal some transport reality to a point.

549
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,380
So it's very quick, I think, that we can read some kind of a wall.

550
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,340
And this debate between, let's say, the neoclassical engineers

551
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,940
and economists and the anti-car proponents

552
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,340
of sustainable uponities is not a very productive one.

553
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,340
And very importantly for this course said, for you,

554
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,900
as I don't know, I've been geographers

555
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,660
for a certain planet of the future,

556
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,420
the relation between transport and the urban in this debate

557
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,980
is very weak.

558
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,060
So conceptually, but also empirically,

559
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,420
this kind of thinking about transport and mobility

560
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,060
simply does not tell us a lot, I think, about the city,

561
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,220
which is why we're here tonight.

562
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,660
Right, so, though let's be constructed

563
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,420
and explore some critical stuff about it basically.

564
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,340
So, I wonder whether you can already pick up

565
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,700
some critique of this from Elena Vania

566
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,940
in her colleague, T. Riebrenak.

567
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,380
I'll be stubborn with the readings today.

568
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,340
Does anybody remember something from the reading for today?

569
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,340
I do.

570
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:12,340
It's been, since I read it, but I know that she has like identified two main principles

571
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:21,860
of critique, which is first that the alternatives that are being proposed by the automobile

572
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:29,060
industry and no specific plans, they are not very like sufficient and reducing the

573
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:40,340
out to mobile impact in certain cases. You can say something wrong and then secondly,

574
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:50,900
well it's sort of a very exclusive sometimes discussion I think, but yeah,

575
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:58,100
I it's not very present anymore, but I would like to pose another question for that paper. It kind of upset me anyway.

576
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,900
Oh yeah.

577
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,300
You can do it right now.

578
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,900
Okay.

579
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,900
Well, go ahead.

580
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:16,100
Yeah, if we're at it, like I basically I liked her way of like introducing her thoughts and like structuring the paper, but I was a bit like put off just

581
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:30,500
methodologically in the way that she links empirical evidence that she produced herself to theory

582
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:44,340
that is oftentimes very theoretical and based on very personal beliefs and attitudes which I

583
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,500
like also support in a way, but sometimes I found that did make her arguments less striking,

584
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,180
and I was just wondering because we are like still in the beginning of all of our

585
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:03,300
like urban critical research careers, how that is to be done.

586
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,700
If you have an answer to that.

587
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,380
I don't know. I mean, I don't have an answer to that question.

588
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,380
Well, I would agree with you that maybe methodologically this is not the strongest paper.

589
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,340
It's an analysis of plans and it's not very clear exactly what she's made with this.

590
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,580
Maybe it's true that her convictions are a little bit stronger than her in periods. In this

591
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:33,380
particular paper, I picked it because it's summarises a few things a little bit better than others.

592
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:40,420
But I really like what she does, even though the best work that she's done in French,

593
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,420
I think which makes it not accessible to everybody here.

594
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,420
But yeah, I think your first point in terms of what's in the article,

595
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,420
it's spot on. It's also there in the title. I mean, she maybe,

596
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,420
again, she risks being maybe a little bit

597
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,420
and engaging in some kind of exaggeration, right?

598
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,420
It's not every single sustainable urban transparency

599
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,420
that leads to the processes that she describes.

600
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:15,820
But there is a tendency for these policies to create some inequalities and for deep politicizing the debate

601
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,780
so

602
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:23,060
It's not exactly clear who these policies are supposed to be for they are these

603
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,380
Obvious a little bit again in this kind of neoclassical

604
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,060
Direction rational tools of now dealing with

605
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,740
With the car is the problem, right?

606
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:39,020
So in fact, the power relations in transport or in transport policy have not really changed.

607
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:45,660
It's just that the focus has shifted significantly and now this is what the planets are doing,

608
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,220
as opposed to what they were doing in the 1970s and '80s.

609
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,060
Let's dive into this.

610
00:37:52,060 --> 00:38:00,140
Whoops. Great. So what are the, and that's my individual, how to put it.

611
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:06,780
my personal top five of the reasons why sustainable urban transport paradigm is not exactly the

612
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,460
you know doesn't give you a complete view of the relationship between transport and the city.

613
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:20,700
And also with some I think quite practical theoretical, empirical recipes for how to get out of this

614
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:29,180
roadblock pan unintended. So the first issue with a lot of the writing on sustainability is that it's

615
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,500
it's still very much focused on technology.

616
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,860
So there is a lot of attention given to technological solutions,

617
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
where social and political innovations

618
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,780
and some brought about political activity,

619
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,940
organization, engagement of people as political agents,

620
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,660
not just the consumers and customers that have to be now

621
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,660
convinced to shift from one mode to another,

622
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,300
from the car to something else.

623
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,060
This is not so present.

624
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,300
And well, this comes from the guru himself.

625
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,940
Elon Musk, who is, despite, of course,

626
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,540
some obvious critique, was his personality

627
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,420
and how he carries himself in media,

628
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,980
he still is very much the hope for many

629
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,620
in terms of transitioning from carbon heavy

630
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,780
modes of mobility to electric vehicles,

631
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,380
which according to the industry

632
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,860
are the thing of the future.

633
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,100
So according to Elon Musk, as he says,

634
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,180
I think public transport is painful, it sucks.

635
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,900
Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other

636
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,820
that doesn't leave where you want it to leave,

637
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,860
doesn't start where you want it to start,

638
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,620
doesn't end where you want it to end.

639
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,980
It's a pain in the ass.

640
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,620
And so that's why people like individualized transport

641
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,020
that goes where you want and when you want.

642
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,100
So the idea here is not to engage in

643
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,740
collectivizing transport, for example,

644
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,780
and making this a more common service

645
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,860
or a more common experience to break

646
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,980
not only the paradigm of dependency on fossil fuels

647
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:00,060
the car, but the tendency on the visual transport, making this basically a less individual

648
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:04,900
activity, which is a social political activity as well.

649
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,660
Now to the contrary, here the idea is to develop a better technology within the power

650
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,980
and a more than a visual transport.

651
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:15,100
And you don't mask, I mean, he's doing a lot of things, but one of the other things

652
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:21,700
in Tesla and the production of electric vehicles that he does is boring tunnels on the Los

653
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:27,780
Angeles to basically create some parallel motorway system if we can call it this way, that bypasses

654
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:35,220
congestion. So actually the focus here while might apparently be on making transport sustainable,

655
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:40,260
it is essentially to solve congestion, which is an extremely, as I explained last time, new

656
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:49,060
classical formulation of the problem. Another issue, and that's from an envious paper, but I think

657
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:54,980
It's not from the one that you had to read for today, but from another thing that I that I like from here is this

658
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,940
focus on

659
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,940
the individual as

660
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,260
not only well

661
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:09,420
I'm to put it not only is the source of a number of transport problems, but also as a solution to to address these problems, right?

662
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,900
So

663
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,900
the idea here is that

664
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,220
Essentially, we can convince people to change the habits,

665
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,620
to change the lifestyle related to transport and mobility.

666
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,500
And in this way, we can solve a number of issues related

667
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,900
to this field of urban planning or urban policies,

668
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:36,260
which means that within the sustainable paradigm,

669
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,700
a lot of policymakers, a lot of trans-foods, they hold us,

670
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,780
would rather than engage in the politics of transport,

671
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,220
they would engage on the pedagogy gets related to it.

672
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:50,420
So it's suddenly the challenge is to make sure

673
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,100
that people engage less in behavior

674
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,540
that is identified as bad behavior, for example,

675
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,820
driving or living in the suburbs, flying around,

676
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,020
and switching to what is considered to be good

677
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,980
type of behavior, positive behavior.

678
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,020
So, cycling around, walking,

679
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,140
living in a city center, living in these dense,

680
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,380
mixed urban areas that don't require

681
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,300
that you engage in mobility so much.

682
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,740
And while this, of course, is not a problem in itself,

683
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,420
I mean, it's good to think of why would people

684
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,820
stick to particular ways of moving?

685
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,740
What's very detrimental, I think, to the debate

686
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,900
and to ultimately solving some issues related to transport

687
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,580
is putting these different ways of moving

688
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,780
and different behaviors related to movement in a hierarchy

689
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,940
where clearly there is a moral component.

690
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,900
So this good and bad behavior, I think this is something

691
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,380
that can actually antagonize people against one another

692
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,660
rather than try to think of transfer problems

693
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,500
as common societal problems.

694
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,860
That's issue number one.

695
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,420
And issue number two is that in this discussion

696
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,220
about individual behavior, engagement with analyzing

697
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,380
and anonymity addressing structural causes

698
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,780
behind transport and mobility is not so present.

699
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,500
So if we focus on the question, why would people drive?

700
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:17,020
and why would people, for example, even in specific ethnicity or gender or class,

701
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,580
trying more than others, it is very important to also understand what is the structure

702
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:29,020
behind this, what is the general policy that allows people to obtain access to a vehicle

703
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:34,140
that allows a parallel or occurring structure which very often, and that's the case definitely in

704
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:41,420
Belgium, it's often absolutely free to use with no taxes to use motorways,

705
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:48,300
or with cheap parking, etcetera, etcetera. So this perspective is in itself not a problem

706
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,380
to look at you know why people engage in particular, the type of behavior and other,

707
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,820
but it's very important to also understand structures behind this.

708
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:04,060
What Alejandro and Nia also writes a lot about and many others as well, but as I said I'm really

709
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:13,020
quite convinced by writing is the uneven geography that is being produced by these different

710
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:22,940
sustainable solutions. Some of these asking a question in the chat, so let me read that.

711
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,020
So maybe there's something in between. For example, self-driving cars and apps like Uber

712
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:32,860
would be able to create smaller vehicles that can be shared as public transport. So in a sense,

713
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:40,540
in between but in between of in between what and between private I mean in

714
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,820
really individual transport and and collective transport you mean

715
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:50,220
Rudy do you want to explain whoever you are?

716
00:44:50,220 --> 00:45:00,780
Hello Rudy are you with us? I hope you didn't just write the comment left

717
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,220
Maybe the connection is not very good on your end.

718
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:11,100
Well, yeah, I mean, clearly in recent years, there's

719
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,020
been a rise of expectations towards this, shared mobility

720
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:15,660
laws, right?

721
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,740
So a number of practices which allow you to get access to

722
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,980
seemingly collectivize transport like Uber.

723
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,180
I mean, essentially you don't own the vehicle, but it's just

724
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,060
not even a phone call with a tap on your phone away.

725
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,780
But there is a number of issues with this.

726
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,300
So there's a question whether this actually replaces individual transport.

727
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,220
So do people have less cars because Uber is expanding in this city

728
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,260
if we're focusing on Uber industries?

729
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,020
There is also a lot of studies that show that Uber actually adds to congestion.

730
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:56,220
So there are more Uber develops in the city or it's counterparts

731
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,620
are different, are the competitive platforms left in China.

732
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,260
There was a huge company called DDE that essentially does what

733
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,660
it was with us.

734
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,460
So there are more of these companies developed in your city.

735
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:14,140
There are more, what the total number of vehicles, the car stock,

736
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,700
increases, which means, and that's a problem in a lot of Chinese cities,

737
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,140
you basically have more traffic jams.

738
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,660
So these cars are in traffic all the time.

739
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,860
They keep looking for customers.

740
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:30,700
they have a mobile, which means that you add to the problem that you try to solve, which

741
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,860
when you try to solve again adding more to these shared platforms.

742
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:40,140
And also the big issue with Uber, if we are focusing on this for a moment, is that the

743
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,580
working conditions of course are quite terrible.

744
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:48,420
So the idea there is that essentially there are exceptions to this, but in most cities where

745
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,420
Uber operates.

746
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:55,740
We workers are not really workers, they're contractors, which means that they very often

747
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,140
go in debt to actually get the vehicle that they're driving, that they have to pay back

748
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,020
to Uber, because it's offering also these services.

749
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,820
This means that they work for a long hours.

750
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:11,100
Unlike regular taxi drivers that have to actually clock in and out, this is much more

751
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,860
regulated in terms of how they work for a lot amount of time and also what knowledge

752
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,140
of the city they have. I don't know how often you've taken Uber in your life, but it's

753
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:25,980
often the case that these drivers are exploring the city along. I mean, they just learn

754
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:31,260
as they drive, which I understand they might come from a very difficult situation that

755
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:37,260
this is the only way for them to get access to a more or less decent way of making money.

756
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:43,540
But there's a question of safety, there's a question of ethics in terms of inviting such

757
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:49,300
your practice in our cities. So there are a lot of expectations for these platforms and indeed

758
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,020
there is a question, does this maybe set between public transport, collective transport and

759
00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:00,020
individual transport but I would say that these hopes are still not really fulfilled.

760
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:05,860
Okay, that was a bit of a delay question. Let's go back to an even geography of sustainable transport.

761
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:14,500
So what is the problem here? More often than not, the application of the sustainable tools,

762
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,860
different policies, infrastructural measures to deal with mobility,

763
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:27,940
especially quite exclusive. What does it mean? Well, on the one hand, it often happens that

764
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,380
a lot of these measures are applied in a specific area of the city and more often than not,

765
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:40,180
This is the central urban core, which has to be saved from the car, which the car has to limit its presence,

766
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:46,900
which in no way contradicts or prevents further maintenance at least, if not development or further

767
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:52,500
infrastructure for the cars in more peripheral areas. So you can think of cities in which in the city

768
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,260
centre you've got restrictive parking regulations, you've got a lot of pedestrian areas.

769
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,820
It's simply not easy to drive around.

770
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:05,620
I think transport is definitely a more logical thing to do and to use to get into.

771
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,620
But the farther you go to the suburbs, the more

772
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:14,740
month I lay in streets or highways you see, or actual proper highways, a lot of parking lots,

773
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:19,220
all the infrastructure that actually well belongs to the 1970s and 1980s.

774
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:25,860
And that is, I think, situation not only in Belgium or in Brussels specifically,

775
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:42,860
But in a lot of these cities that are supposedly have achieved a great level of policy in terms of dealing with with with cuts of Copenhagen, Vienna, a lot of French cities that boast these tram renewal programs.

776
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:48,820
As long as you are in the central part of the city, this old looks very coherent and very

777
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:53,140
well inverted, common, good from the sustainable transport perspective.

778
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,620
But the farther you go from the city centre, the more actually the more cars you see, the

779
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:02,220
more it actually resembles the problem that these policies try to solve.

780
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:09,860
Another inequality is of the vertical kind, meaning that it often happens that the investment

781
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:15,780
in these kind of sustainable tools comes at the cost of putting the current infrastructure underground.

782
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:22,340
So you can think of any case in which the specialization of an urban avenue or pull-over,

783
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,900
that means that the cars have to be put underground parking lots or the highways.

784
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:34,500
And this is often the problem in the so-called Car-Free Cities. The cities that are often picked up

785
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,540
by international media and praised for having addressed head-on the domination of the

786
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:49,620
cars and dealt with the problem of opportunity. A specific tool that I think we can see this

787
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:56,020
uneven geography in is a question in the chat. An example for Rudy's question from Berlin,

788
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,740
great. Let me go on with the congestion charging while you're discussing Uber in the chat.

789
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:07,220
this is perfectly allowed. So an example of this uneven geography can be found in

790
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:15,540
congestion charging, which is one of the let's say one of the most classical tools of sustainable

791
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:21,700
transport paradigm in terms of limiting the presence of the cars. The idea is simple. It came from

792
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:26,900
Singapore in the 1970s, which was developed as a very new classical tool of planning,

793
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,020
basically the problem was congestion and the idea was to convince to encourage drivers to use the

794
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:40,820
car off peak, so to minimize the traffic, the traffic jams in morning and afternoon or evening peak hours.

795
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:47,620
And progressively this tool, or perhaps with a shift of velocity behind transmit from the

796
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:55,380
neoclassical sustainable perspectives, this tool was picked up by the sustainable narrative. And now

797
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,540
It not only allows to solve congestion, but actually it allows to limit the presence of the

798
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:04,500
current city, which of course supposedly makes a positive impact on the urban environment.

799
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,900
And this tool has been put in place in the number of cities in Europe.

800
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:14,580
So you hear sea pictures from Oslo, but actually this exists in pretty much all

801
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:22,580
Norwegian cities and towns. So a system of tolling gates in London, which is probably the most

802
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:28,820
important or the most known case in Europe, in Milan, but you also have similar policies and

803
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:34,580
instruments in Stockholm and Sweden. And then recently also in Brussels announced with a lot of

804
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:41,540
pump and circumstance this idea that now it will cost the user the end-user money to enter with

805
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:50,900
a car to the Brussels capital region. So while this gets a lot of attention and this policy is

806
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:57,140
is discussed as a very efficient tool

807
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,340
in terms of limiting the presence of the current in cities.

808
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,860
There is questionable evidence.

809
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,380
I'm not saying that this policy is a bad policy,

810
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,340
but it never works.

811
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:13,220
But basically, it's supposed productive results

812
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,580
in terms of limiting the car are not exactly

813
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,180
there in the evidence.

814
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,940
So the results are quite mixed.

815
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,780
On the one hand, we see that in a number of cities,

816
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,220
traffic, of course, diminishes.

817
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,220
But since it's the delimited zone,

818
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,260
it's quite particular.

819
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:33,420
So it's not a whole agglomeration that actually

820
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,780
has the access to the car limited.

821
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:39,380
We see that the traffic often moves from, of course,

822
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,940
the zone in which the congestion challenge

823
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,300
is applied to the outer areas.

824
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,380
In London, for instance, it's quite clear

825
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,220
that there is significantly more traffic around that zone.

826
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,540
It's the same case in Madrid, which essentially

827
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,020
followed a very similar principle.

828
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,700
There is also very questionable evidence

829
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,980
about what happens with the funds that are being raised

830
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,100
through these systems.

831
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,700
So while very often, these policies

832
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,180
are put in place with this narrative of saving the city

833
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,060
from the car, of making some kind of societal transition

834
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:14,180
to post-car society, in cities like Oslo or London,

835
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,540
funds from these schemes.

836
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,780
And in all that's very clear, in London,

837
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,540
maybe a little bit less transparent.

838
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,140
But at least part of these funds goes to actually maintenance

839
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,940
and construction of current construction.

840
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,340
In all it's very common practice

841
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,620
to put these congestion charging areas

842
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,900
or booths, if you will,

843
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,260
to actually subsidize the construction of specific

844
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,420
transport infrastructure, road tunnel or bridge.

845
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,660
It's done in a very transparent way.

846
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,580
So in a sense, it's basically asking the transport

847
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,860
the car user to contribute a little bit more,

848
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,900
because of course, this contribution is already there

849
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,940
through tax system, to the construction,

850
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,460
to the financing of the construction

851
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,820
of transport infrastructure of current infrastructure.

852
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,460
And finally, the impact of these schemes

853
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,540
on overall quality of the city,

854
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,100
not just on a quality in a specific area,

855
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,060
is quite limited.

856
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:13,220
So, yeah, I said it basically.

857
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,320
So despite the narrative of these practices

858
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,140
saving urban environment,

859
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:21,020
it's not exactly clear that this is the most obvious thing

860
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,900
to do to limit the smog in a city,

861
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,100
especially when these areas are quite,

862
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,340
especially limited.

863
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,260
The problems that immediately emerge

864
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,020
from policies like congestion charging is that,

865
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,020
well, it leads to some social segregation.

866
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:44,060
And so we expect that all people react to this policy in a similar way.

867
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,540
They will reconsider whether they want to try or not, whether they want to enter,

868
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,380
into the zone by current or not.

869
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:53,340
But in fact, of course, those who do not pay from the vehicle,

870
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:57,380
and in particular in Belgium, this is a policy that is very widespread.

871
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,260
Half of new vehicles sold in Belgium are so-called company cars,

872
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,380
which are received for free by employees from the company

873
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,620
as a way of giving them tax-free salary bonus basically.

874
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,700
So for these people who do not pay for the vehicle itself

875
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,620
and often whose consumption of the vehicle will gas,

876
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,020
or any kind of fuel they put in the car insurance,

877
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,100
this is all paid by the company very often.

878
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,060
This very often basically is included in the package.

879
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,860
So the congestion charging is actually not covered

880
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,660
by the individual, it's covered by the structure

881
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,340
that provides the vehicle in the first place.

882
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:36,460
While of course those who do not have a job who might be seeking one,

883
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:44,140
those who are from lower working class background who might also be doing very difficult,

884
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:49,900
complicated irregular trips that require entering and leaving in different times of day,

885
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,940
because they need to get to a job that quite simply requires getting by current.

886
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,100
Going back here to this example of somebody working logistics,

887
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,340
public transport between Mollenberg or Savantam, for example,

888
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,860
at three o'clock in the morning being simply not there,

889
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,540
you have to have a card to reach this kind of activity

890
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:13,220
to be able to access the kind of urban function.

891
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,340
And then ultimately, what it does to mobility

892
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,660
is commodified.

893
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:22,420
So it's an essentially neoliberal service.

894
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,180
You pay as much as you use.

895
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,100
It's not a common system anymore.

896
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,720
The idea is that everybody pays not according to the means

897
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,720
but according to the ultimately the price decided by the market.

898
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:41,000
So again, not to say that this is a part of good idea

899
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,260
but to say that there is quite simply a lot of questions

900
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,760
a lot of them quite clearly related to critical geography

901
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,920
that should be asked about these policies.

902
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,840
It's already passed seven.

903
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,000
So it's just we take at least 500 break

904
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,120
before we can continue.

905
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,920
So get a little bit of a drink.

906
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,240
whatever it is that you are you sipping to make through this lecture.

907
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,080
And I'll see you back in in for five minutes, all right.

908
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:26,880

[ Silence ]

963
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:42,340
Okay, let's try to resume.

964
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:49,340
I'm going to share my screen once again.

965
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:59,340
All right.

966
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,340
Where are we?

967
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:04,700
All right

968
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:11,980
I suppose you hear me and you see me

969
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:15,780
Great perfect so

970
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:22,140
Continuing with the uneven geography of sustainable transport measures

971
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:27,180
Here you have a very simple

972
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:35,980
or even a map or a scheme that shows a little bit how this limitation plays out in space.

973
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,380
So also, I don't know if you've heard about that, but also is one of the most

974
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:44,700
-marketised cities in terms of its alleged fight against the car.

975
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:50,660
It's leading some kind of a war against the petrol fuel vehicles.

976
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:55,980
And basically there is this area in the city in which to which access is not only restricted

977
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,740
in terms of extra payment, right?

978
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,860
So there was a cube.

979
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,140
At several layers of this congestion charging,

980
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:07,220
and then the final one is this ultra inner city

981
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:12,220
in which cars propelled by gas or fuel.

982
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,460
I'm not allowed, there's only electric vehicles.

983
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,420
But then when you look at the whole

984
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,740
of the migration of the city is quite clear that,

985
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:20,420
I mean, this is a very small area.

986
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,820
So we are actually talking about quite specific zones

987
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,460
of the city, which as I mentioned,

988
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:32,820
supposedly saved from the car and as opposed to be made more pedestrian or people friendly.

989
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:44,260
Same idea or same limitation can be seen in Madrid which, until recently, had also quite a restrictive mobility area.

990
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:50,020
This has changed with a change of political majority, it does not matter, but this area still exists over the rules.

991
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,380
have changed to some extent.

992
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:58,740
The idea is that Madrid, which was called in worldwide media,

993
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,100
as an anti-car municipality, a municipality that takes

994
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,820
some radical measures to limit the presence of the car.

995
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:08,140
In fact, well, it does serve, but it does so

996
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:13,380
within quite limited designated area,

997
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,660
whereas you see that in a general map.

998
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,060
There is a whole current structure around it,

999
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:23,660
multiple motorways both around and from that central area.

1000
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,900
So there's a question with the automability

1001
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:31,460
is actually being properly challenged

1002
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:34,060
or is this more of an urban policy that focuses

1003
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:37,260
on valorization of specific areas of the city.

1004
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:41,980
And here it's you don't have to be a smart critical geography

1005
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:45,980
to ask if this is not part of some revitalization strategies

1006
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:49,900
that try to increase rent and profits

1007
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,820
to gentify quite simply a specific areas of the city,

1008
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:57,620
the limitation of car traffic being part of that policy,

1009
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:01,660
to beautify the area, to make it more attractive to tourists,

1010
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:06,660
to specific type of investors, while limiting mobility

1011
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,460
of this kind.

1012
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,940
This we've covered.

1013
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:17,460
And here we arrive to the well, to a case of such a policy,

1014
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,060
limiting presence of the car, the Pietonier in Brussels,

1015
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,900
which I'm quite sure.

1016
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:28,420
All of you have already experienced and seen.

1017
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,780
So, well, this map you've seen quite a lot before

1018
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:36,300
and show Brussels with its zone 30,

1019
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,460
so the limitation of speed there.

1020
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:46,580
the Petonier marked in red at the moment of installation, the biggest pedestrian area in Europe.

1021
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:54,100
I wonder whether you've got any impressions of this place before I show you my take on

1022
01:07:54,100 --> 01:08:00,260
or share with you my take on what happened over there. I imagine you have been to Lippetonia,

1023
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:06,500
but do you have any any interesting thoughts about this? Do you like this place? Do you think

1024
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:17,460
It's not so great. I don't know. I don't have a very deep thought about it. I don't think

1025
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:25,860
but it's definitely nicer than it was. I mean, I lived in the center for like five years ago

1026
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:31,460
or like five years ago, like long ago, but like it was really horrible. Like when you cycle

1027
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:38,740
through like downtown it was really awful because like the road was just disgusting like

1028
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:45,860
you don't you didn't really want to be there. I mean it's a bit I don't know I don't have

1029
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:54,580
the feeling it's very much it's it's very true for what it is you know like for like I don't

1030
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:59,940
know it doesn't really feel like a downtown it feels a little bit provincial but like at least

1031
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:04,940
I'm definitely happy with that it's much better than it used to be.

1032
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:11,940
It's definitely an improvement, but it feels the big city vibe a bit.

1033
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:12,940
Okay.

1034
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:17,940
But those of you who didn't see it before it was changing to a village scenario,

1035
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:24,940
I think it's the slice you see in the top image how this street could look like on a Friday afternoon,

1036
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:25,940
quite regularly.

1037
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:28,940
So full of cars for full lanes.

1038
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:33,940
And then, well, the situation, that's of course pre-covid.

1039
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:34,940
Well, I don't know.

1040
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:37,260
I probably right now, if you took that picture,

1041
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,540
would be quite similar.

1042
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,340
Anybody else who has some impressions

1043
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,900
of how this transformation looked like?

1044
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:49,900
Somebody who loves this, somebody who hates this,

1045
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:51,300
and for whatever reason?

1046
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:55,940
- I agree with you, everyone,

1047
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:58,700
because it was a place.

1048
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,260
And when I passed, when I studied in Brussels,

1049
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,540
I would have passed with my girlfriends.

1050
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,260
I don't want my girlfriend to let alone,

1051
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:09,900
or they had to place some years ago.

1052
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,620
But one frustration, I guess from,

1053
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:16,820
I followed the top process.

1054
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:21,820
And what I know was it was very difficult for transportation,

1055
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:26,740
like like M.E.B. and the steep public transport,

1056
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:30,260
to pass because the lane was cut.

1057
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,940
- Yeah.

1058
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:36,380
- So they waited for four, four, two hours to go to another place

1059
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,700
when it set to us, five minutes was two hours.

1060
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:43,180
- So you need to affect it the other modes of,

1061
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,460
of trying to not only the car,

1062
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,060
but also public transport.

1063
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,060
- Yeah.

1064
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:47,900
- Yeah.

1065
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:50,740
The victim was public transport and I guess in,

1066
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,300
in Brussels, it's very important to,

1067
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,740
when you have a prestige project like that,

1068
01:10:55,740 --> 01:11:00,740
You need to consider all of transport modes and not only pedestrians.

1069
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,100
- Praise each project.

1070
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,740
- I think also it's an important thing.

1071
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:10,060
Also like an element to add maybe is that it's terrible

1072
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,260
if you go by bike.

1073
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,060
It's really not made for bicycles.

1074
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,340
Like I tried cycling through it and I mean, right now

1075
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,820
it's not so busy and it's all right.

1076
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:22,820
But like on days when there's lots of tourists,

1077
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,420
of course lots of people use the area.

1078
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:28,380
So then it's really not nice to cycle there.

1079
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,780
- Yes, I share these impressions.

1080
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,460
I mean, these are not only impressions

1081
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,300
and the fact is that this area was redeveloped

1082
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,900
but without any bicycle policy in mind.

1083
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,220
So there is basically, I'm not,

1084
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,060
I'm the last person to say that what was there before

1085
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:45,660
was great, but you can vaguely see it

1086
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,260
on the right hand side of the top picture

1087
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,900
that there is actually a bicycle lane.

1088
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,260
Not a great one, but there was one.

1089
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:54,340
Now it's simply not there.

1090
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:57,100
somebody's writing something in the chat.

1091
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,940
Why did they take down the larger trees

1092
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,620
to be a traditionalization of Boulevardless?

1093
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:03,020
But I find the landscaping quite poor.

1094
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:06,740
Well, so there was a number of things at stake.

1095
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:09,820
I mean, let's cover that first.

1096
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,180
It was announced in January 2014,

1097
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,180
the municipal authorities of the city of Brussels.

1098
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:17,460
So we said, "Meel, Brussels 1000,

1099
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,140
"and ours that they want to expand

1100
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,460
"and existing pedestrians."

1101
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,140
So you already had some streets,

1102
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,260
especially towards the Commonwealth of London,

1103
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:26,340
were not open for the class.

1104
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,580
And the context of that-- and that's quite an important thing--

1105
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:31,260
is that there was a series of protests

1106
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,900
called Under the Slogon of Picnic the Streets,

1107
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,780
a movement of some spontaneous civil disobedience.

1108
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:40,620
Basically, people would occupy space that would normally

1109
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,540
be taken by cars.

1110
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:45,500
You see that in the top picture, normally a lot of cars.

1111
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,900
So right in front of books, there

1112
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,100
would be basically some kind of an action.

1113
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:56,300
people would just sit down and enjoy their son and manifest that they want allegedly

1114
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:01,820
this space to be for people, taken away from the cars. This space should be freed from

1115
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:05,900
the cars to make the city centre of Brussels for sustainable, more attractive and more

1116
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:10,240
livable. The project is launched in June 2015, so that's one of the

1117
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:15,340
three is closed. And there is an eight-man test phase without any infrastructural change.

1118
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:19,980
So at first, to go a little bit to the question of design, there is no design change. Basically,

1119
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:25,020
the street is closed and there is as many people call it a sea of asphalt.

1120
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,260
I mean suddenly you can walk on this on the street, which place a little bit,

1121
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:33,260
of course, on people's imaginary that suddenly you realize how, how huge this

1122
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:38,780
infrastructure given to the car is and what could happen in place of this infrastructure.

1123
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:44,780
Well, and then progressively after this eight-month phase, we see some kind of

1124
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:50,060
infrastructure development, so an actual change of the built environment.

1125
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:54,980
The problem there is, is that, well, there was a quality of design that has been put in

1126
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:55,980
the question.

1127
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:59,540
I'm not a designer or landscape, but a lot of people have criticized the way that this

1128
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:00,540
looks like.

1129
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:06,120
The immediate limitation is that, right underground, we've got a canal towards the end

1130
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,860
of the bits of the year, and we also have a metro line, of pre-metroline, which runs

1131
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,180
right under the surface of the street.

1132
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:15,100
So it's not, for example, possible apparently

1133
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,200
to put large trees over there, which already

1134
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:23,020
starts making an impact in terms of how the space is done.

1135
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:28,660
Well, there were very high aspirations

1136
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,260
when Pitunio was announced.

1137
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,620
It was not only supposed to be a transport project,

1138
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:36,380
or according to some scholars in Brussels,

1139
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:39,100
or even politicians, it was not a transport project,

1140
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,060
or a mobility project.

1141
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:47,980
was an urban renewal project which by closing this Paris like Boulevard because actually

1142
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:56,060
it is in its architecture very much an inspiration of Parisian boulevards. A closing of it to

1143
01:14:56,060 --> 01:15:01,980
motorized traffic was supposedly a step towards getting the city center or the city as such

1144
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:09,340
out of the climb to put as the mayor of a moistel mill of the particular moistel

1145
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:14,700
said that Brussels, the Belgian and European capital would finally enjoy a truly dynamic,

1146
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:20,060
pedestrian, attractive and friendly inner city, like many other international metropolists.

1147
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:25,660
The Plas de Guacare, which is located in the northern part of the Piedtagnier,

1148
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:30,620
and that's the famous square famous I'm not sure, but the characteristic one with the Coca-Cola

1149
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:38,620
and signed that lights up. It was compared to Times Square, so the idea was to make this project

1150
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:43,260
It allowed Brussels to become an international city

1151
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,220
to create this prestige project,

1152
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,420
as it was, I think, very rightly said,

1153
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,220
that would put Brussels on the international map.

1154
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:53,820
It was not just a question of getting rid of some

1155
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,860
correlated new senses.

1156
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:58,020
And of course, the moment that plan was unearthed,

1157
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,020
there were a number of critics.

1158
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,180
So there were shopkeepers that were upset,

1159
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,620
claiming that they would use customers

1160
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:05,100
because people could not drive into the shop,

1161
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,060
residents, a number of citizen organizations.

1162
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:11,300
What were the issues that they would mention,

1163
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,900
and even the problems that they would note about the project?

1164
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,420
Well, they very much relate to this

1165
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,060
and the geography that I was talking about.

1166
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:22,460
So if you look at the map of the Pizzo here,

1167
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:27,260
in red UCDs, at that time Europe's largest

1168
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,700
pedestrian zone, I think now it's been surpassed by Ghent

1169
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,140
and other cities.

1170
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,780
Brussels is certainly not the only city in Europe

1171
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:37,540
or in the world that engages in these policies.

1172
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:48,140
It is, of course, the main central axis is cut, but you see that you can actually drive around the city center.

1173
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:56,340
So you've got this area which is pedestrian friendly if we can put it this way, where cars mobility is extremely limited.

1174
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:01,340
But in fact, you can quite easily drive into the Pentagon, as we call it, and drive around.

1175
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:06,340
On top of that was also very clear is that a particularity of Brussels,

1176
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:10,340
which is a very high presence of underground or multi-story parking lots,

1177
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,340
is largely unquestioned.

1178
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:19,340
So actually this day, today, there is about 19,000 parking spots within the

1179
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,340
pendant, within the Struk City Centre of Brussels.

1180
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:26,340
The original plan of pedestrianising will advance.

1181
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:32,420
a lot included the creation of additional 1,600 parking spots.

1182
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:38,900
So the idea would be that, of course, we give this space to the pedestrian and we allow this

1183
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,100
space to be somehow reclaimed from the car.

1184
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:46,580
But in fact, the cost of this, or the price of this, I don't know how to call it, is that

1185
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:48,300
we actually add to the current infrastructure.

1186
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:55,260
So we definitely do not want to make this be less accessible as it was called by the cars.

1187
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:00,220
And then as one of you mentioned, there was an immediate conflict with a public transport

1188
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:05,420
operator, the most important one in Brussels, Stephen McAvill, who basically saw their

1189
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,460
lines pushed out of the zone.

1190
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:14,660
So suddenly the buses that would cross that area have to have to have these stops relocated,

1191
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:23,380
which means the accessibility for people who rely on public transport is somewhat reduced

1192
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:24,380
right.

1193
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:31,100
Well, that's some years later. I think that picture is from 2018, as I remember checking on Google.

1194
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:35,180
Well, those are kind of a pushback, right? So the cars that were at first,

1195
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:40,380
definitely not allowed in Petonier now in some circumstances, in some situations, can actually

1196
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:45,660
enter. So you can actually see, and that's taken directly from Google, I didn't have to go to the

1197
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:51,740
Petonier and wait for a track to enter. You actually see, of course, the delivery vehicles,

1198
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:56,380
but also public transport you see over there in the back of the picture as she does a bus

1199
01:18:56,380 --> 01:19:01,100
making a turn and entering a petrion. And whenever I'm there with friends who are not from

1200
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:06,460
Brussels, I mean they are really surprised to be on the pedestrian area with public transport

1201
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:11,820
buses and trucks and taxi drivers and other vehicles who in exceptional circumstances actually can

1202
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:17,820
enter. Which question is a little bit this, I mean is this a pedestrian area or is this a pedestrian

1203
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:21,820
area but without really getting rid of all the costs.

1204
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:30,820
The question of making this a prestige project and putting Brussels on the map,

1205
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:35,820
I mean there is an argument there to be made and some local critical

1206
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:39,820
geographers have made it myself included that this in fact indeed is not a

1207
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:42,820
transport project in the mobility project. It's clearly a project of

1208
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:49,180
of re-valorizing this particular part of the city, it's quite clear that as you go down

1209
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:54,820
southwards down Boulevard of Stau and Boulevard of Le Monier towards the South Station

1210
01:19:54,820 --> 01:20:00,220
Government of Medi, those of you who have been there, I'm sure, I'm sure noticed it,

1211
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:05,220
those of you who haven't, that's where we will go on the excursion that I hope we will

1212
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:06,220
do.

1213
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:10,740
In spring, you see that this is one of the poorest neighborhoods in Brussels, one with

1214
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:17,820
very high youth unemployment, especially when there was a very precarious, tightly knit,

1215
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,900
but very vulnerable local economy.

1216
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:27,780
And any kind of change in built environments puts this economy under huge pressure, especially

1217
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:35,380
when the narrative around Kaitanya clearly includes this idea of bringing big grants, tourism,

1218
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:42,100
to the pedestrian area making this a place of facilities, of consumption, of continuous festival.

1219
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:49,460
So for example, the ultimate for comments of the city of Brussels famously said that

1220
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:54,740
the objective here is not to change mobility. The objective is to create a commercial

1221
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:59,940
promenade, new brands which are not yet present in Brussels are coming. There is a real craze

1222
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:07,620
and you can feel it. For the current Brussels 1000 May not the one that had to step down because

1223
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:14,020
of some corruption scandal, the aim of the project is to keep or bring the middle-class

1224
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:20,820
to Brussels to increase its tax base. So suddenly the idea is not just to or not at all to actually

1225
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:26,580
get rid of the cars or allow pedestrians to enjoy in some kind of newly created area,

1226
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:29,860
It's a very urban project in a very twisted way.

1227
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:35,460
So the idea really is to create a new space and your neighborhood perhaps of consumption,

1228
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:44,980
of leisure, of 24/7 shopping, which also, of course, uses or engages with the narrative

1229
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:51,060
of sustainability and livability, and is somewhat related to mobility and transport, but to a limited

1230
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:52,980
extent. Okay.

1231
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:56,980
Can I still add something to that?

1232
01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:03,580
If you go back to that slide, you see that there is almost only white people there.

1233
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:10,180
So the people that you talked about that you see on the lower slide, like the owners

1234
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:17,820
of the PC market, owners of the 5.50, basically all people with a color, they don't

1235
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:21,300
feature in the marketing of the city about the project.

1236
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:26,060
It's a very good point, of course. That's a very common issue with these visualizations

1237
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:28,260
and imagining of future.

1238
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:33,780
Everyone's super white. But there's one black man on the right.

1239
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:40,100
But there's also no people with disabilities, very few old people.

1240
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:48,260
Yes, it's not a very diverse image. It's a good point. And also in no way does it correspond

1241
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:51,380
the actual reality of that neighborhood and the kind of services.

1242
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,140
Absolutely not.

1243
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:56,100
Well, I mean, yeah.

1244
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,340
Well, I'm really just teed it up.

1245
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:02,740
So we cover some important stuff until we finish.

1246
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:03,460
No, no, but thank you.

1247
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:04,900
It's a good comment.

1248
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,780
There is, of course, all issues related to participation

1249
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:13,320
and no actual change of power in the P

1250
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,740
is a very good example of how these sustainable ideas

1251
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:22,580
can be applied without changing at all questions of who actually decides and for whom transport

1252
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:28,660
policies are being made. So very often the sustainable discourse focuses when a

1253
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:35,460
demandance participation of users of the of the of the of the projects. It basically

1254
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:41,140
imagines that the main idea is that it will consensus to inform people of the decisions that

1255
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:46,180
are rational, that are good practices, best practices in terms of achieving sustainable

1256
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:49,420
mobility, protecting the environment and whatnot.

1257
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:54,420
So as a Flamish actually scholar once wrote it in 2000

1258
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:57,220
about the problems of sustainable transport policies.

1259
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:59,100
That's the last bullet point.

1260
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,060
These policies include a harmonious and conflict

1261
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:04,780
of only vocabulary that ignores and silences

1262
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:07,460
the deeply contested ways through which the transport system

1263
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,740
is continuously shaped and transformed,

1264
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,980
and which inevitably results in a variety of winning

1265
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,140
and losing interest groups.

1266
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,420
in the case of the Kit-Wun-Ye, but that's, I think,

1267
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:19,180
the case in many other sustainable transport projects.

1268
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:22,380
This idea of winners and losers is swept under the carpet.

1269
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:25,260
So in theory, everybody gains,

1270
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,540
but those who are clearly upset are not heard,

1271
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:30,940
are not really listened to and often are mocked.

1272
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,740
So again, we go back to this moral geography

1273
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,340
of bad behavior and good behavior,

1274
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,780
of silly shopkeepers who don't understand

1275
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,900
that this is a project that they will benefit from,

1276
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,420
bad car drivers, they want to access the city,

1277
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,940
versus good consuming middle class pedestrians

1278
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:49,980
or cyclists, not so much on the case of duplicating method.

1279
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:52,140
Cyclists are also part of the vision.

1280
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:58,580
And in all this, to make this point quite short,

1281
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,900
there is much more impact,

1282
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,100
no, not impact, much more focus,

1283
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:07,820
much more emphasis on the success of these practices,

1284
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:12,500
rather than on the interaction with complex social,

1285
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,820
spatial phenomena that are there in the city.

1286
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:18,180
So there was much more focus on the transport part

1287
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,580
of transport project rather than on the urban part

1288
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,540
of the purchase.

1289
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,580
Well, we don't have a lot of time to deal with,

1290
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:26,700
okay, what could be done with this hegemony

1291
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:30,180
of neo-Neoclassical on the one hand, that's last week,

1292
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:32,300
and sustainable on the other.

1293
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,220
That's today, perspective on transport, but let's try.

1294
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,580
So what would diverse critical approaches

1295
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:42,260
to transport and mobility be?

1296
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:45,340
On the one hand, the new mobility paradigm.

1297
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,900
So that's another reading for today,

1298
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,660
if you manage to read it, that's great.

1299
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:52,220
If not, I encourage you to have a look

1300
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,340
because that's an absolutely fundamental reading

1301
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,220
for mobility scholars these days.

1302
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,260
I mean, many shallering John Aria

1303
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:03,100
to very important figures in this field of geography

1304
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:07,260
or any kind of discipline that deals with mobility and transport.

1305
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:10,500
So here, we've got a bit of a shift of attention,

1306
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:14,820
shift of focus, and it's really putting,

1307
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:18,380
it's shifting away from transport as an infrastructural phenomenon,

1308
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:21,740
for example, to a mobility as a social and political phenomenon

1309
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:25,180
that's an respective built on diverse disciplines

1310
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,340
from sociology and political studies to a geography

1311
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:30,140
and anthropology.

1312
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,700
And it really explores a lot of issues

1313
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:36,420
cultural studies scholars for example, would deal with looking at a number of phenomena happening in

1314
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:41,380
cities. So different representations and meanings of mobility, sensations, experiencing

1315
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:46,180
experiences of mobility. Everything that happens on this might for level of what people,

1316
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:53,220
what kind of practices and norms are being observable, being practiced in mobility related spaces

1317
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:58,820
in public transport for example, in these pedestrian areas. What cultural codes and norms are related

1318
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:07,380
to optimability. The problem with this particular approach is that well it looks very much at the

1319
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:13,140
micro level and whenever it engages with structural issues around mobility it runs the risk of

1320
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:18,180
being quite descriptive. So it mentions a number of issues, race, class, inequality but there is not

1321
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:23,060
so much over methodological depth in terms of exploring these issues. And also it's a constant that

1322
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:25,660
that is quite Western in a sense that they developed

1323
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:29,180
in the global north and in rather specific areas of it.

1324
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:33,220
And it only now starts engaging with situations

1325
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:36,220
with empirical context, indigo global stuff.

1326
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:43,260
Another approach, another avenue for doing critical research

1327
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:48,260
by the trust of mobility is building on the traditions

1328
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:50,420
of urban political economy of transport, right?

1329
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:54,020
So looking at the city as a social and political construct,

1330
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:57,180
which by no means, by in no way,

1331
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:01,140
is governed by some rational laws of supply and demand,

1332
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,060
like in the new classical paradigm,

1333
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:07,740
or which does not really look at people as consumers

1334
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:11,380
that have to be convinced to drop or to disengage

1335
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:15,300
from unwelcome or bad type of behavior

1336
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,860
and standing engaging in good type of behavior.

1337
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:25,860
But rather looking at people at urban inhabitants as political agents who do not make just rational decisions in terms of how they move,

1338
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:34,860
but have a political potential to shape the urban reality, to change how transport and mobility is organized in the locality in this city.

1339
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:43,860
And when you look at critical urban geography and a lot of names that I'm sure you've already heard or maybe even read from before,

1340
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:47,060
David Harvey, Neil Smith, Edward Sarger,

1341
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:51,380
Dave all contributed to conceptualizing

1342
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:53,340
to exploring this lane between

1343
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:54,820
and for structural development

1344
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:57,700
and social spatial distribution of public services.

1345
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:02,700
So transport has been there to analyze

1346
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,020
the critical development of the city.

1347
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:09,940
But absolutely foundational readings there

1348
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:13,140
or the first step towards critically exploring

1349
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,620
the relationship between the transport and density,

1350
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:18,180
come from feminist geographers who would arrive

1351
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,380
and that's the reading that you also,

1352
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:23,060
I think was assigned for today.

1353
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:27,060
Susan Hansen's work on deconstructing this

1354
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:29,780
behind the divide between the home and work

1355
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:34,780
and attaching women with domestic situations

1356
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:41,540
and apparently imagining them as less mobile beings

1357
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:50,700
while attaching this mobility potential to predominantly male subjects and male situations.

1358
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:59,180
And also, well, a very important part of that is to understand the homework

1359
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:04,620
relationship in the homework commute, which I mentioned last week is absolutely the most

1360
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:10,780
well, it's a foundational focus of transport geographers, analyzing these mobility

1361
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:17,020
patterns related to the move from work to home. The feminist geographers already in 1980s

1362
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:24,060
demonstrated that this way of looking at transport and also this way of engaging mobility is

1363
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:29,900
fundamental for maintaining capital. This is something that is the cornerstone of the

1364
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:37,260
of the capitalist system in cities or outside of them. What emerges from this is understanding

1365
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:42,140
Transport and mobility is not just an infrastructural phenomenon or something that has some

1366
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:46,860
environmental repercussions and some social ones and here I'm thinking about sustainable approach

1367
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:56,300
to mobility, but as essentially a form of capital, mobility is a potential that is unevenly

1368
01:30:56,300 --> 01:31:03,100
distributed as any form of capital around a cross-society across its different spaces and across

1369
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:09,660
it's classes, which leads to understanding and challenging different structures, social, political,

1370
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:15,820
economic, that stand behind what makes transport unsustainable in the first place. So it's really

1371
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:21,020
asking you a question why are people moving in particular ways not because they are used to a

1372
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:25,100
particular lifestyle because they have some cultural norms but understanding a political and

1373
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:30,860
economic system that enables, for instance, the domination of the car and trying to address the

1374
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:35,620
the system as a result rather than looking at how people can be convinced and

1375
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:39,740
all how situation in terms of mobility can be changed in specific areas of the city.

1376
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:43,580
It's looking at things much more, much more broadly, much more structural always.

1377
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:52,220
Right. So, and here I attached the geography to the end of this, to this slide.

1378
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:54,980
So you can look at these different studies if you, if you're interested in

1379
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,420
transport and mobility.

1380
01:31:56,420 --> 01:32:00,340
There is a line of research that is looked at the transport

1381
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:05,660
and mobility as a way of reproducing existing social,

1382
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:09,500
political, economic interests, regulatory frameworks,

1383
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,500
power relations regulated by the market on the one hand

1384
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,540
and by the state, and very often contested by from the bottom

1385
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,660
up.

1386
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:21,020
There is a lot of research, for some reason,

1387
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:22,620
the references are not showing up.

1388
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,980
But if you're interested, I'm more than happy to send you

1389
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:27,620
that something is stranded with my slightly.

1390
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:31,900
But there isn't ongoing work already going back to the 1990s

1391
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:37,060
that shows how neoliberal policies that affect urban culture,

1392
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,460
provision of housing, urban environment,

1393
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:41,780
are also extremely present in provision of transport

1394
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:45,180
and mobility, how in a natural transport

1395
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:46,980
is increasingly commodified.

1396
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:48,860
And for example, congestion charging,

1397
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:50,460
and as I mentioned today, it's part of that.

1398
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:54,020
It's turning, and we could think public space

1399
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,320
that an urban motorway or an urban street

1400
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,700
is, it to a commodity that has an additional price

1401
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,780
that I can touch to it, which as we consume,

1402
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:05,180
we have to additionally pay for, depending,

1403
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,140
as I mentioned, not on our means, but basically

1404
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,700
on our demand.

1405
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:15,820
There is also a fundamental issue that many geographers dealt

1406
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:19,460
with, that is of transport related inequality

1407
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,940
and exclusion, so basically trying to understand,

1408
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:27,820
to what extent transport enables movement of some people

1409
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:30,780
while restricting that of others.

1410
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:33,020
This will skip.

1411
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:36,660
And of course, well, it might seem very obvious today,

1412
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:39,980
but if you look at what was being done in geography,

1413
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:42,500
now in geography or transport geography in the '80s,

1414
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,580
the '90s was definitely not the case.

1415
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:47,100
There is now a rise of research, which

1416
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:50,820
looks at the questions of class and the questions of race

1417
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:53,620
and the question of gender is absolutely fundamental

1418
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:58,420
for understanding transport systems in cities and beyond them.

1419
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:01,900
And one of them is this, well,

1420
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,620
maybe not such a foundational reading,

1421
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:06,500
but still something that is very important

1422
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,740
and really define the agenda of research

1423
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:13,300
into transport for at least this decade.

1424
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,140
Of course, there's more recent stuff

1425
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,180
that also has been written,

1426
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:18,900
but I think this is quite a nice introduction

1427
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:23,140
with the question of gender and mobility.

1428
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:27,540
And here, we see that as with the questions of race

1429
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:28,740
and the question with class, but this

1430
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,900
is something that was already quite established

1431
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:35,140
and if you'll already, there is an inseparable relationship

1432
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:37,220
between gender and mobility.

1433
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:40,340
That, on the one hand, transfer of mobility

1434
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,220
mean development or some kind of opening

1435
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,620
of accessibility to different opportunities,

1436
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:50,300
breaking this supposed paradigm of the domestic female

1437
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:53,380
and the work-related male, but actually mobility

1438
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:56,300
is something that opens this paradigm,

1439
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:59,780
that gender on the other hand affects travel reasons

1440
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:01,780
and patterns in terms of the complexity,

1441
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:04,300
in terms of the frequency and regularity,

1442
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:08,020
and in terms of why actually people engage in movement,

1443
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:10,180
why is they actually move around the city?

1444
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:13,860
And perhaps one critique that could be made

1445
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:19,860
the paper that I ask you to read for today is that the approaches women as a rather unified category

1446
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:28,020
that can be maybe not reduced but summarized in terms of particular mobility patterns that

1447
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:35,940
half of humanity engages. I think that's a little bit risky always. But what clearly I think is

1448
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:42,020
interesting in this kind of line of work, as I said, there is a definite follow-up and work that

1449
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:45,860
explore these questions in much more detail and it's much more fine to you to

1450
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:51,540
sophisticated. But we see that without considering the agenda component we

1451
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:56,660
basically missed the fact that in many urban contexts women engaged in a

1452
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:00,660
completely different way with mobility. They conduct trips which are

1453
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:05,940
much more complex, regular because they quite simply are related to

1454
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:09,940
diverse, care-related activities. They would be much more inclined or

1455
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:18,740
or perhaps forced to bring other people along to act as drivers for other passengers,

1456
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:26,260
and because they engage in quite simply more activities than male subjects.

1457
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:29,300
In this way, I'm simplifying here, of course, a whole lot,

1458
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,660
but this way of approaching transport and mobility,

1459
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:35,660
uncovers not only differences in terms of how people move,

1460
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:39,500
but differences in terms of power relations that are there behind movement

1461
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:45,580
and transport, which in my humble opinion is maybe a little bit there in sustainable

1462
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:50,220
approaches to mobility, but it's quite simply not pronounced enough or it does not really show us

1463
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:57,820
in full depth the the multi-level structure of power relations that are there behind

1464
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:07,980
behind transport and mobility. Now what's left, we are running out of time so I don't

1465
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:13,420
don't want to talk about everything, but what's also important to remember is that, well,

1466
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:19,820
besides questions of transport workers, because so far we've basically talked mostly, if not

1467
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:25,820
only about passenger transport users, people who use transport. There's a question of transport

1468
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:31,900
labour, but also very importantly, a lot of research done on transport and mobility is a vehicle

1469
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:35,980
for some contestation, discontent and struggle.

1470
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:40,100
And I started these two sessions with Greta Tundberg,

1471
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:43,100
with protests in Chile and other places.

1472
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:47,500
And year in, year out, sometimes month in month out,

1473
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:51,900
you see that transport is used as a very important subject

1474
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:55,900
for a lot of very diverse movements and social groups

1475
01:37:55,900 --> 01:38:00,140
to express the discontent with whatever it is.

1476
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:02,900
sometimes quite directly capitalist system,

1477
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,780
and that's the case with Gilles-Jon,

1478
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:08,000
who quite symbolically would occupy

1479
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,300
roundabouts across rural or suburban France,

1480
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:15,300
and sometimes symbolically,

1481
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,940
and that's an East Jerusalem,

1482
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:21,580
Palestinian activists attacking the light rail,

1483
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:22,940
and kind of traumway stations,

1484
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:26,300
as a symbol of Israeli colonization in East Jerusalem.

1485
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,660
Sometimes this would be protest against

1486
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:35,100
some kind of the surface level policy, like the increase of public transport fares or policing

1487
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:40,860
and that's the case in New York City, or the construction of one of these underground parkings

1488
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:45,980
related to the Piotonier that would add to the number of parking spots in the city while

1489
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:53,260
supposedly actually opening the city for the for the people. This we will have to skip.

1490
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:59,180
The very last point that I want to make today, I mean I still would like to give us maybe

1491
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:03,020
10 minutes for your questions and maybe some comments.

1492
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:06,060
If you still have energy to do that,

1493
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:08,700
is that, and that's perhaps related a little bit

1494
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:11,060
to this question of neoliberalization of transpose

1495
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:14,380
and mobility, is that what we see is that

1496
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:18,300
despite these different theoretical approaches

1497
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:21,060
and critical questions that people,

1498
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:23,660
critical geographers are asking,

1499
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:27,580
we see a process of standardization

1500
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:29,100
of transport policies.

1501
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,540
So if you are a transport engineer and transport economist today,

1502
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:37,300
there is really distancing towards unifying experiences

1503
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:40,340
of different cities into a portfolio of best practices,

1504
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:43,420
which are then transferable from one or currently

1505
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:44,260
to another.

1506
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:45,900
There's a huge business behind it,

1507
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:51,060
and not only in terms of think towns and big consultancy firms,

1508
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,620
but a whole flurry of events,

1509
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:56,020
which you can learn from experiences of others,

1510
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:59,060
which you can learn about what your city should be doing.

1511
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:03,060
And some scholars have engaged with that,

1512
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:05,560
studying specifically the policy mobility

1513
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:08,020
of these best practices and recipes

1514
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:10,720
in the field of urban transport.

1515
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:14,160
But what's perhaps quite important to be to be added to this

1516
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:19,160
is that, well, the story of policy transfer is quite long.

1517
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:22,300
I mean, the tradition of deploying Western worldviews,

1518
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:25,780
Eurocentric concepts and theories and methods

1519
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:27,820
in a more or less unchanged way

1520
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:32,300
in some other geographical contexts in Africa, Asia, Latin America,

1521
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:38,220
is a very long story and the story as a name and its colonisation of coloniality.

1522
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:47,420
And this is something that really is there to be done by the future generation of critical geographers,

1523
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:52,300
or the transport geographers, or urban geographers. Is that of decolonising this body of knowledge

1524
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:59,100
which pretty much everything that I have referred to in these two sessions comes very much

1525
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:05,820
from the global north that reflects my own education, that's something that I think I still have

1526
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:11,820
to do myself, is to really start looking at transport reality and start defining,

1527
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:17,740
formulating questions about this reality in terms of transit mobility, not from our global

1528
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:20,500
will know them perspective, but also that of the South.

1529
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:24,940
And just again, it's just a simple example

1530
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:27,340
of what this could mean in practice,

1531
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:32,060
is looking at the question of informality in transport,

1532
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:34,380
which traditionally, that's a slide from one

1533
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:38,100
of these classic reports commissioned,

1534
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,340
I think either by UN or the World Bank

1535
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:44,660
on informal transport, looks at informality in transport

1536
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:47,100
as something that means bad quality,

1537
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:51,380
in terms of safety of passengers, speeding, environmental impact,

1538
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:54,420
basically some alt-ricutty vehicles,

1539
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:59,260
which are a way to be transformed into modern, Western,

1540
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:03,020
formal public transport system.

1541
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:06,140
The kind of we know from northern cities, like Brussels

1542
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:11,140
or many others in Belgium, France or Germany, whatnot.

1543
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:14,740
But, and that's something that has been done quite recently

1544
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:22,580
is in process, is actually understanding our experience of transport and mobility in our formal

1545
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:27,140
environments is very much something that can be informed by these informal experiences of the

1546
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:34,420
Google South. An example, well, if you ever are at Garlic Media these days unfortunately this practice

1547
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:41,700
is on hold because of you know what, there is a flurry maybe not but at least a few informal

1548
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:48,100
transport practices that you can find in the Galdimi area, these informal taxis, vans that bring

1549
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:55,380
passengers informally somewhat illegally from the south station to Sharlowar Airport to the

1550
01:42:55,380 --> 01:43:02,260
Brussels south Sharlowar Airport and to Paris, which exhibit very strong similarity with

1551
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:08,820
many other informal practices that you can find in cities across South Asia, Africa and Latin America.

1552
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:14,500
And then finally, while these practices of course attract whenever they do, they attract very negative

1553
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:19,940
attention of the media, of the police, they have treated as something that is illegal and be unfair

1554
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:27,380
to formal regulators that pay taxes and have to operate within the legal framework of, in this case,

1555
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:34,900
the Brussels capital region, there is, and here we go back to the beginning of the first session,

1556
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:38,660
A number of practices which are proposed by the transport industry,

1557
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:42,820
transfer the mobility industry, Uber and many other app-based practices,

1558
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:49,060
which are essentially informal practices, which try to operate in the insertices of the system,

1559
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:55,780
somewhat legal, but also not to the full extent. If you think, for example, about what Uber does

1560
01:43:55,780 --> 01:44:01,860
to its workers or what is the spatial impact, if we can put this way or these

1561
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:08,260
East Kudos, which operate in public space, but very often literally occupy the space, the paving

1562
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:15,540
and whatnot, without necessarily making this system officially legal or recognised.

1563
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:24,420
Well, here we pause our little write of two sessions. I apologise for this bit of a fast

1564
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:29,540
pace ending to the second session, but I realise that we run out of time for discussing

1565
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:34,260
things a little bit more detailed way, but we still have eight minutes for some

1566
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:38,900
questions if you have them, maybe some points that you you have in your in your

1567
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:44,580
head right now something that you want to share. This is the moment.

1568
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:48,860
And maybe I'll stop sharing my slides.

1569
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:59,100
Do you have some questions, some comments?

1570
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:18,100
Well, it's perfectly fine if you don't, of course.

1571
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:21,100
I mean, it's quite late in the day I understand it.

1572
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:29,100
And it's definitely a suboptimal experience to do that through Zoom or any of these platforms.

1573
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:35,100
Oh, right.

1574
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:40,100
Vitaly is asking about transport labour.

1575
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:42,100
There's also one more technical question.

1576
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:50,100
Well, quite simply the concept of transport labour looks at labour relations and conditions in transport.

1577
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:54,860
is trying to change the emphasis a little bit.

1578
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:56,220
I mean, if you look at the literature

1579
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:59,340
on the neoclassical or sustainable side,

1580
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:04,340
and the dominant focus of, I would really say,

1581
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:07,700
99% of the studies is on the passenger

1582
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:11,140
or the driver or the consumer.

1583
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:15,780
The question of what working conditions

1584
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:18,140
are shift to sustainable transport intervals, for example,

1585
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:20,420
It's very rarely asked.

1586
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:26,860
And that I think can lead us into some dead end situations,

1587
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:30,180
in which, for example, we really give a lot of hope

1588
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:32,180
and we build a lot of expectations

1589
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:34,180
towards some ability practices like Uber,

1590
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:37,660
like the electric scooters or whatnot,

1591
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:39,980
without really understanding that,

1592
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:42,860
and that comes from transport-level literature,

1593
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:45,140
that the main innovation that Uber brings to the table

1594
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:49,380
perhaps is not connecting drivers and users,

1595
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,500
because it existed before.

1596
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:54,540
And I mean, informal transport without the app, of course.

1597
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:58,780
But it exists in most cities in the world,

1598
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:00,180
in a global, some global nodes

1599
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,740
and cities being an exception rather than rule.

1600
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:06,420
But the actual innovation is degrading

1601
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,860
transport, degrading working relations

1602
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:11,300
to end of the 19th century.

1603
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,900
Basically, a worker has very few rights.

1604
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:17,140
doesn't have to write the unionized collectively bargain.

1605
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:19,300
And it's not even recognized as a worker.

1606
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:23,660
It's basically some kind of free atom contractor

1607
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:28,660
who in spare leisure time engages in driving people

1608
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:32,660
around the city, which we all know from now

1609
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:35,500
the whole body of work on Uber is definitely not the case.

1610
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:38,340
And these people are full-time workers,

1611
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:41,340
not just hubists who try to make some spare money

1612
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:42,340
on the side.

1613
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:45,340
So yes.

1614
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:48,340
That's what's transport labor is about.

1615
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:50,340
Some technical questions.

1616
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,340
Let's address those.

1617
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:52,340
For the next discussion,

1618
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:56,340
Seminar is at the same way of working with PowerPoint and voice over.

1619
01:47:56,340 --> 01:48:01,340
Well, the way I understand you did it in other discussion

1620
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:04,340
Seminuses that you basically recorded your presentation,

1621
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:06,340
which then either you sent to me,

1622
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:09,340
I think that's probably a better solution.

1623
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:14,840
solution and we basically listen to and then we have a discussion in which you facilitate

1624
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:20,340
it, right, as those who discuss the paper. So it's not exactly a voiceover. I mean,

1625
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:25,380
so you don't present the PowerPoint's life, the ideas that you pre-record the presentation

1626
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:33,220
with your fellow students. And will the exam be online as well? Yes, the exam will be

1627
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:38,260
online and we are meeting with Basnik and David to discuss exactly how this will be

1628
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:44,380
down most likely will be in well obviously since we will not be in your rooms it

1629
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:49,020
will be an open book exam so you will have access to the slides and all that so

1630
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:53,260
but since we haven't done that before it will be a classic exam we are

1631
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:57,460
discussing how to do this so that it's challenging enough for you and also

1632
01:48:57,460 --> 01:49:05,900
not too difficult right so it's with the voice of an indeed. Has the Belgian

1633
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:09,900
Brussels government have taken any action to prevent informal transportation. Do you know how

1634
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:14,460
relaxed they are towards this? Well actually I researched these navets as they quote.

1635
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:21,660
"Nelgo from midi to the shallower airport and no, the Brussels government is definitely not happy

1636
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:30,220
about these informal tax, the situation there is that these men, all of them are are are are

1637
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:37,180
Cameo, official taxi drivers, so they have a taxi license, but what they basically do is that

1638
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:44,300
make more money, they offer individual seats in the vans and they taxi. And that's precisely what's

1639
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:50,780
illegal. So you cannot, as a taxi driver in Brussels, you cannot basically stand there on the street

1640
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:56,780
and try to approach potential passengers, offering them individual places in the car.

1641
01:49:56,780 --> 01:49:58,780
It has to be the whole car that is rented.

1642
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:05,580
Well, it's a bit ironic, but what happened a few years after this practice

1643
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:10,140
got into the focus of, I don't want to say, public debate, but basically these drivers

1644
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:13,260
started being harassed by police and there was a legal procedure against them.

1645
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:19,660
Flitco, I don't know if that name rings a bell. It's a company that runs the official bus

1646
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:25,980
from me to Shalawa Airport, started exactly that. So they're basically now

1647
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:31,420
offer well now it's standard but they started offering a van service which goes door to gate

1648
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:36,460
as it's called and it picks individual passengers and individual seats are offered. And for

1649
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:44,540
some reason this is perfectly legal whereas the taxi drivers are partly engaging in an illegal activity.

1650
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:55,820
So just as a rebound you know why Flipkuh implemented this in a non-competitive way

1651
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:59,820
why I mean is that they're actually more expensive than the Navet,

1652
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:06,460
they're like informal and a bit. Because I think they have a very different customer target.

1653
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:11,980
So people who would take a Navet, that's also from my own work, they would be very often

1654
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:16,140
of immigrant backgrounds, so there's a lot of people from Eastern Europe, from Maccribe,

1655
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:21,420
who are quite simply used to do this mode of transport for them. This is a very common thing to see

1656
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:26,300
and use in the country of origin.

1657
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:29,380
And also, the drivers of the Navet

1658
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:32,340
would basically find the customers on the spot itself.

1659
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:33,780
So you walked towards the bus.

1660
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:35,380
I don't know if you've ever had that experience.

1661
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:41,380
But whenever I had to walk to the bus of Flikko,

1662
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:45,180
they would try to approach you and convince you to write with them.

1663
01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:48,460
Whereas I think people who use the internet

1664
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:52,340
with access to a website who can know how to book a ride,

1665
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:57,340
with a credit card to book a right, that's a different target group.

1666
01:51:57,340 --> 01:52:02,580
So maybe that's why if people can offer prices

1667
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:05,580
which are not exactly competitive on the economic front.

1668
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:11,980
Well, what it means that's the last sentence about an event

1669
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:14,580
is that informality in this case,

1670
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:17,100
it's some kind of a front for, in this case,

1671
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:20,180
state institutions to define what's legal or not.

1672
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:23,300
I mean, for them to decide that the naviet,

1673
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:26,700
this informal drivers are informal and therefore legal.

1674
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,340
I mean, it's an arbitrary decision

1675
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:31,980
to decide that this is informal, whereas Uber is formal.

1676
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:35,500
Or actually in the case of Uber,

1677
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,380
and Brussels authorities,

1678
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:41,140
the regional authorities pretend that Uber does not exist.

1679
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:42,900
So they don't chase it away,

1680
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:44,060
but they also don't promote it,

1681
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:46,900
which is a perfect playground for Uber.

1682
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:49,620
They are, they, that's exactly what they want.

1683
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:55,740
They are not interested in being recognized as an official public transport service, for

1684
01:52:55,740 --> 01:53:00,540
example, because that would mean having to comply with a lot of regulations, which they

1685
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:05,020
are of course not interested in complying with.

1686
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:11,820
In your research about this, do you know if like Uber drivers partner up with the like

1687
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:18,180
informal Navet drivers to actually try convince clients to use the informal Navet rather

1688
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:20,260
than the Flipkop for example.

1689
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:22,180
No, I don't know.

1690
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:23,860
In this particular case, they definitely not.

1691
01:53:23,860 --> 01:53:27,660
I mean, the event drivers, as most taxi traffic

1692
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,940
and bus will be hate over, they really

1693
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:32,340
don't like that it exists because it basically

1694
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:34,980
eats into the market.

1695
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:39,300
I'm not saying that taxi drivers here are some angels

1696
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:47,220
and most, I don't know, fun people to work with or on,

1697
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:53,660
But they can also offer services which are overpriced

1698
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:57,260
and try to rip off tourists and all of our young people

1699
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:01,140
who come back home intoxicated by taking a very long route

1700
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:01,780
or whatever.

1701
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:03,340
With Uber, of course, the advantages

1702
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,900
that you know the price before you get into the car,

1703
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,580
more or less.

1704
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:10,380
But in this case, no, there's definitely no collaboration.

1705
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:15,140
I've said that there is some conflict even.

1706
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:17,140
You've probably heard about not already

1707
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:19,700
happened at least three times massive strikes

1708
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:23,500
of taxi drivers against some kind of effort

1709
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:26,940
towards regularizing Uber by the Russell's

1710
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:28,780
and capital region authorities.

1711
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:36,740
Any more questions, comments?

1712
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:40,780
Well, it also goes without saying that at some point

1713
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:44,980
will be picking topics for your master thesis.

1714
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:47,740
And you are very welcome to pick some related

1715
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:50,460
to transport and mobility, either supervised by me

1716
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:51,180
or by other people.

1717
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:54,860
There is some more in our team and in different departments

1718
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:55,220
as well.

1719
01:54:55,220 --> 01:55:01,340
But I don't know if I succeeded, probably to some extent,

1720
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:03,540
but not fully.

1721
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:06,580
But if there was one thing that I really wanted you

1722
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:08,620
to understand about transport and mobility

1723
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:11,860
is that at least from the critical geographical perspective,

1724
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:13,740
it's a really, really diverse field.

1725
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,740
There's plenty of things to do.

1726
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:19,100
And there's plenty of interesting things to do.

1727
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:24,100
So I really look forward to seeing your research topics

1728
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:26,980
and hope that at least some of them will be related

1729
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:28,260
to transport availability.

1730
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:32,060
If you need some little push or some encouragement,

1731
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:34,060
we are always there to help you with finding

1732
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:37,540
some interesting literature for inspiration or whatnot.

1733
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:42,340
So, I really, really hope we meet in person one day.

1734
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:45,540
I hope it's not too far in the future.

1735
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:47,980
I really hope that we can do an excursion,

1736
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:50,620
even though it's on the transport, it's interesting.

1737
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:55,620
People say, so voila, I really hope that we can do that

1738
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:58,860
in March, April, May, the latest.

1739
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:03,860
So, until then, I wish you all the best with everything

1740
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:05,780
and with the exam.

1741
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:13,940
Good luck. Don't get discouraged by this online paradigm. It will be away soon. I hope.

1742
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:20,180
So we will be in touch with you about the exam. Don't worry about it.

1743
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:23,060
Enjoy. See you later.

1744
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:32,180
