Yes, we can.

82
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:26,100
my ideas about urban transport and mobility. Well, it's a lecture, so it's very difficult to make it

83
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:33,060
highly interactive, but I will still try to ask you some questions and I think I hope it's

84
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,060
It's possible for you to try to respond to them not only through chapter basically, you know,

85
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,900
turn the audio on video and I don't think it will be a conversation but at least it will

86
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,180
be nice to hear some other voices, not only mindful two hours and then two hours again.

00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,980
read some articles and I hope you will have a discussion there so that we can make this

110
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,780
Today we're going to talk about a historical hegemony

111
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,020
to different main sets of approaches to urban geography

112
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,100
of transport.

113
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,340
And next week, we're going to try to deconstruct all that

114
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,860
to address this in a critical manner

115
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,340
and to understand how to look at urban transport

116
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,780
and mobility from a critical set of perspectives.

117
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,980
So without further ado, today we're going to start

118
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,380
with a bit of a historical overview of the relationship

119
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,700
between transport and the city,

120
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,060
how this relationship evolved in at least two directions,

121
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,980
and discuss as much as possible,

122
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,940
as much as time will allow us to.

123
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,740
This historical hegemony of two main sets of approaches

124
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,180
on urban transport and geography.

125
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,620
So the classical and sustainable perspectives

126
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,660
of urban transport.

127
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,100
But before we begin,

128
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,300
I'm really curious about what your expectations might be.

129
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,300
I imagine that a lot of you in, you know,

130
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,140
starting a course of urban studies or geography

131
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,020
didn't really expect to study transport.

132
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,060
Why would the transport be important

133
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,980
for understanding cities in the geography?

134
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,300
What do you think?

135
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,300
Would anybody like to say something

136
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,420
or type it in the chat?

137
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
That's the moment.

138
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,460
We're gonna have a few of these open questions

139
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,020
throughout these four hours together.

140
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,380
Why study transport when studying cities?

141
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,620
Why is that important or not?

142
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,140
- I did actually expect transport to be part

143
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,620
the study because to me at least it alters the way the city is structured, sometimes it's

144
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,140
structured around a specific mode of transport. There's differences between

145
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:40,700
they call like Harvard cities or cities more in the middle of land something and I think it

146
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:47,500
makes a big difference with how with a geographic air development. So to me it's actually, I think

147
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,900
I think it's a key factor.

148
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,500
- Right, so we would have some impact on the urban form

149
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,740
on, I'd say, the spatial arrangement of the city.

150
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,980
Why else, there are many reasons as you can imagine,

151
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,340
but what comes to your mind?

152
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:07,060
- I think it also like Matilda already mentioned before,

153
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,940
one main aspect is sustainability and cities

154
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,940
how to reach the climate goals.

155
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,940
So, it's linked to different transportation systems.

156
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:31,940
So, to think of, let's say, environmental impact of cities and transport being the big part of that.

157
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,940
Possibly, or being part of the problem, right?

158
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,540
So generating emissions, CO2 and other gases that contribute to the climate crisis.

159
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,820
All right. What else?

160
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,860
I think something has to do with JAPOP PUNTURITIES.

161
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,380
JAPOP PUNTURITIES.

162
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,700
For example, in Lagos in Nigeria, we see people moving for hours

163
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,740
to look for a job and go back again. So eight hours, they're spending in

164
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,860
in causal.

165
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,180
- Right, right.

166
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,820
- So transport is, well,

167
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
without transport is difficult to get around the city

168
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,900
and use its different functions

169
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,060
and use different opportunities

170
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,980
that the city might provide,

171
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,620
like employment, education, leisure,

172
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,780
many other things.

173
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,620
All right.

174
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,860
Any last points before you move on?

175
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,540
Does somebody have a great idea

176
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,340
to add this little discussion?

177
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,940
Well, okay.

178
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,940
Well, I think today, yes, it's quite,

179
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,580
actually, is this slide a little bit cut

180
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,420
or do you see it?

181
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,940
Yeah, I think this will be better now.

182
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,020
So today when you open the news,

183
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,660
I think it's difficult to not to notice

184
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,180
the transport is, well, very present, I would say,

185
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,980
in the public debate.

186
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,420
Last year, I'm just taking a few examples here.

187
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,940
last year, you probably read about, and maybe even participated in a witness, huge

188
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:13,140
protests that erupted in Chile, starting in the capital of the country, which of course

189
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:19,340
very much addressed fundamental structural issues in terms of how capitalism develops

190
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,700
in this country and how it has its urban or spatial impact.

191
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,820
But the beginning of the protests was so that the final even dropped that actually led

192
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,820
to the option of those strice and these operations

193
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,620
was the increase of public transport first,

194
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,820
and specifically the underground phase.

195
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,180
In Brussels, that's the top right corner.

196
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,740
We've, in the past years,

197
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,060
we witnessed a series of protests in public space

198
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,460
that address the increased presence of the car,

199
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,100
which supposedly these protests claim takes space

200
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,460
from the people, so it'll decrease the quality

201
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,620
of a new life.

202
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,780
negatively impact the quality of living, health conditions,

203
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,980
especially of children.

204
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,980
And then the figure on the top left,

205
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,020
I'm sure that you all know Greta, who

206
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,140
refers to transport, of course, she doesn't talk only

207
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,580
but transport, but she does.

208
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,780
And she makes this very political statement

209
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,220
of not traveling by plane and using one of the trains

210
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,540
to go to her meetings or conferences, at least before,

211
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,860
COVID she did, the idea there is to show us

212
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,260
that there is a necessity for us to engage

213
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,740
in some social and environmental transition

214
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,300
and transport is part of this transition.

215
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,900
So the way that we've moved around,

216
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,260
the way that we've lived,

217
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,140
is essentially unsustainable,

218
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,420
it's detrimental from the environmental point of view.

219
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,500
We need to change that radically, meaning

220
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,580
in a very drastic way.

221
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,740
So really, in a very profound way,

222
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,980
it also in terms of speed of that change in order to address what shared and devices

223
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,300
the main issue today and main problem today which is the climate crisis of the climate catastrophe

224
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,380
that is imminent. It's I think easy to yeah just by following the news to realize that well

225
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,500
something is profoundly wrong with with the way that we are mobile today and that has to change

226
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,620
and indeed the industry or the those whether the key actors in terms of producing transport

227
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,940
is there to, of course, respond with some solutions at least.

228
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,500
So we're being told that at least one of the solutions,

229
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,220
or one of the series of solutions that are available,

230
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,140
are those of platform-based economies of shared digitalised, smart,

231
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,820
gig economy-related mobility or mobility.

232
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,180
So for instance, in the future, living in the city,

233
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,380
we don't have to have a car.

234
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,860
It says, you know, the tremendous demand,

235
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,780
we can rent one through an app.

236
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,140
We can drive electric cars which are readily available in public space in our cities. We can use one of these

237
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,500
electric scooters and many other modes of transport that have

238
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,740
boomed in recent years in many many cities of the global north especially but also in global south.

239
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,100
And Brussels, I'm sure those of you who are from the city of

240
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,380
being there for a couple of months now. You know you can observe many of these different

241
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,020
practices of mobility, very present in the city, and some of them at least being part of a

242
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:24,260
narrative of some change, of some future, of something that is shaping the way that we live and move

243
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,940
around the city. From a more scientific perspective, one answer why to the question why is that

244
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:38,100
the transport? Is that quite simply? And I think actually the very first sentence of one of the most

245
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,660
seminal textbooks on transcription of transport geography.

246
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,780
There wouldn't be no transportation without geography,

247
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,940
and there would be no transportation,

248
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,740
no trajectory without transportation.

249
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,620
Transport of transportation in North America

250
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,180
is an essential geographical issue.

251
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,220
The idea is, and again, it's the same textbook,

252
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,860
that transport allows to reduce the distance to zero, of course.

253
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,860
That reduction never really happens, but the idea is

254
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,940
the transport allows to annihilate space and time

255
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,340
that is required to conquer, to cover that space.

256
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,620
But I think beyond that very dry definition

257
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,260
of the relationship between the two,

258
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,820
what's quite important is that, well,

259
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,460
it's very hard to imagine not only contemporary,

260
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,340
but also pre-modern ancient societies without movement

261
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,060
without transport.

262
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,060
It's something that has always been fundamental

263
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,980
for human societies for human settlements.

264
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,980
And today, and that's something that I will try

265
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,940
to show you in these two lectures

266
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,380
and in the discussion that will follow the week after.

267
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,060
Transport is absolutely fundamental for studying the city.

268
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,940
And I think it's a fascinating entry

269
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
for studying what cities are today,

270
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,980
what problems might be found in the not only

271
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,780
transport problems, but social problems,

272
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,940
spatial problems, economic problems related

273
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,860
to all different challenges that at first,

274
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,700
at least do not seem to be transport related.

275
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,660
So in fact, they are being negotiated, articulated,

276
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,620
contested, solved sometimes, but more often

277
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,260
unfortunately created through the production

278
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,780
and distribution of transport.

279
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,980
So we will try to impact this relationship

280
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,740
starting by, let's say,

281
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,500
more of a historical analysis.

282
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,460
So I'll start in mid-19th century

283
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,540
in Sootheesen, Western Europe

284
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,740
in what we can identify and pre-industrial era.

285
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,740
And we will bring that analysis to the 1960s, 1970s.

286
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,700
Let's see how much time we've got for this today too.

287
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,100
Well, let's say the beginning of a major crisis

288
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,340
that formed or framed the debate in a way

289
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,740
that it is being framed still today.

290
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,700
So some kind of a setting of a contemporary challenge

291
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,180
or series of contemporary challenges related

292
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,460
to transport and mobility.

293
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,660
So all right.

294
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,860
So the main point here--

295
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,380
I don't want to spend too much time on this historical part

296
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,420
because I don't think this is the, well,

297
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,180
it's not contemporary, so perhaps it's not as interesting

298
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,300
as as many challenges that are happening right now.

299
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,820
The main point here is that urban transport systems

300
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,260
are a very strong and strictly related

301
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,980
with urban form and with a spatial structure.

302
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,660
So the development of cities is conditioned

303
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,140
by the development of what we call transport modes

304
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,620
from walking, so just walking on foot,

305
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,820
to the bicycle, the public transport, and to the car.

306
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,340
And there is a persistently strong relationship

307
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,540
between the intra-urban transportation system

308
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,140
and the organization of the metropolis

309
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,900
as Miller, who wrote one of the most seminal,

310
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,500
again, textbooks on the history of transport geography,

311
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,340
tells us.

312
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,940
And there is a variety of different urban forms

313
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,020
and spatial structures and land use patterns

314
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,020
which are related specifically or very closely

315
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,260
to the development of different transport norms.

316
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:05,980
And as far as I understand, you've covered quite a few of the most important models of development,

317
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,180
urban development throughout history with Nick.

318
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:15,740
You can not hear if that's the case and deny the fact if you didn't.

319
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,260
But I think that this was covered at some point.

320
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,980
And the idea here is that in a lot of these models, although not explicitly mentioned,

321
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,860
transport was actually absolutely crucial.

322
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,660
So the idea was both the adjacent unknowns and movement

323
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,100
and mills mentioned that without the development

324
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,300
of different voices moving around the city,

325
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,620
the development of which of course to an extent

326
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,020
erroneously they tried to model or predict

327
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,340
would not be able to happen.

328
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:48,820
Well, the debate has been there in the

329
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,780
in transport geography until the 1970s, 1980s,

330
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,740
how to model that relationship, how to analyze it,

331
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,740
whether in fact it's more the development of a decision

332
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,460
that drives the development of transport

333
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,260
or the other around with its development

334
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,780
of different transport modes,

335
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,940
that drive the development of the city.

336
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,580
It's not a particularly interesting debate today,

337
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,980
but it's important to acknowledge that geographers

338
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,620
were very early on,

339
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,540
urban geographers interested in the development of mobility.

340
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,940
One, also rather imperfect and symbolic rather than

341
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,300
analytical way of describing this is through identifying

342
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,460
some cycles of innovation.

343
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,340
So looking at different scientific developments

344
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,540
come-- well, some scientists would say

345
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,980
in these kind of crucial moments.

346
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,220
There's a bundle of different innovations coming together.

347
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,060
So at the end of the 18th century, as you can see at the left

348
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,180
inside of the graph, the invention of water power textiles

349
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,540
iron than some 60, 70 years later,

350
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,420
the steam engine rail, production of steel,

351
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,540
et cetera, et cetera.

352
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,220
Each of these bundle of innovations

353
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,260
allowing to, of course, create a more efficient

354
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,300
that you can be faster and more energy efficient

355
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,260
way of moving, of course, not only within,

356
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,100
but also between cities, changing not only the way

357
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,100
that people move, but also the way that the city itself

358
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,020
could be organized in space.

359
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,940
And in this sense, we could,

360
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,620
although of course this is not a perfect robust typology,

361
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,180
but we could come into some kind of agreement.

362
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,260
You don't have to accept it,

363
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,820
and I'm happy if you erase some issues with it.

364
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,060
But we could divide the development of the city

365
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,540
around the development of transport

366
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,220
by identifying four different stages,

367
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,260
I wouldn't call them errors,

368
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,540
but a city that is a pre-industrial city

369
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,220
that largely was based on walking,

370
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,220
since more motorized transport was generally speaking,

371
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,020
not that it was just not there

372
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,060
and having a horse would be an extremely expensive

373
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,220
investment, which means people walked.

374
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,220
And industrial city, which developed around the birth

375
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,740
of what we could identify today as public transport,

376
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,540
first horse driven carts and then motorized ones,

377
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,300
Then the Ford is city which very much developed around the,

378
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,700
not only in the invention, but rather the

379
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,980
classification and the finalization of private vehicles

380
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,980
and private cars.

381
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,960
And then a city of today, the post-F

382
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,540
is city which very much fails on the development of

383
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,460
transport modes that use the ICT information

384
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,340
and information and communication technologies.

385
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,380
And of course aviation, so the city does,

386
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,500
is very much related also to the development of all

387
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:47,780
typology of spaces related to flying to airplanes, both passenger and cargo transport.

388
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:54,740
Are there any questions at this stage before we dive into these different four stages?

389
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,020
I don't hear anything. Yeah, yeah. How to go ahead.

390
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:08,100
The draw we see is linked to a conradive because we saw something like this.

391
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,260
with lessons of Nick?

392
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
- Yeah, I would say so.

393
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,500
I think that it's one of the ways of,

394
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,060
I wouldn't say that it's specific,

395
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,300
yeah, that it's completely matches conductance ways,

396
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,060
but the idea is the same,

397
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,300
that there is some kind of development of innovation

398
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,060
within the capitalist system,

399
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,180
which allows to gain some competitive advantage

400
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,700
which allows to create some kind of growth machine,

401
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,620
and then is competitive advantage over time

402
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,660
is lost so that we have to decline until it picks up again.

403
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,060
What I think with contract is still not clear is whether this new wave,

404
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,460
so the one that here in this graph happens after the 1990s, it's very clear.

405
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,980
So as far as I understand, although I'm not especially here,

406
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,900
there is a discussion whether this new wave is with the digitalization

407
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,860
and software engineering is actually materializing,

408
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,740
or whether we've arrived at a global system,

409
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:11,780
which there is no growth of, at least within industrial production,

410
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,820
but it's rather a financial, financialized growth.

411
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:20,500
But it's a good, let's say it's a good hand,

412
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,380
it's the idea is more or less the same, the same intuition.

413
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:29,300
Also, the problem with this clearly is that it's not, I mean,

414
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,180
this kind of way of trying to understand what happened in cities around transport in the past,

415
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,220
two centuries is extremely Western focused or very Eurocentric.

416
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:47,780
So this would not be a story of cities in most of Latin America, Africa, and South Asia,

417
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:55,140
and also post-Soviet or Soviet world. So the global south and the global east, as it's

418
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:02,020
sometimes even called today, it's not really part of this story that is told by this graph.

419
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:09,700
We will try to address this, but it's, yeah, it's, that will happen at the very end of the last

420
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,420
of the last session to try to decolonize a little bit our knowledge about transport geography

421
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,180
because it's extremely westernized and extremely for a Eurocentric.

422
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,140
Right, let's dive into that.

423
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,820
Right, so the pre-industrial city, right?

424
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:32,580
Well, I guess it's quite self explanatory. It's not very difficult to understand.

425
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,860
And indeed, the idea is that the city basically is, well,

426
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,940
since there is no motorized transport modes

427
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,540
and having, as I mentioned, having a horse or a horse car,

428
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,540
it's a cost of fortune.

429
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:50,340
It's an absolutely luxurious good, pretty much everybody

430
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,780
walks.

431
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,940
And since everybody walks, the city cannot be too big for people

432
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:01,740
to cross it on foot within more than 20, 30, maybe 40 minutes.

433
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,260
So a traditional global northern European city would have,

434
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,300
until, let's say, end of the 18th century,

435
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,500
no more than five kilometers in diameter.

436
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,300
That would mean, of course, here, for example,

437
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,500
you have the map of Brussels from that time.

438
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,380
That would mean that within the city walls,

439
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,220
which existed for military purposes, for defense,

440
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,780
there had to be a very high density

441
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,220
of different functions of different users.

442
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,820
And for other reasons that we know how to dive into today,

443
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,060
a grid street pattern was also very common

444
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,860
from middle ages onwards.

445
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,220
Also very importantly, since these, well,

446
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,500
not maybe since, but as these different functions

447
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,220
were mixed, maybe this mixity was allowed partially

448
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,580
also because of the fact that the division between work

449
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,540
at home, a division that is absolutely fundamental

450
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,620
for a lot of writing on transport geography

451
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,860
that focuses on that morning and evening commute

452
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,060
from home to work and work from home.

453
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,100
That did not exist.

454
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,260
Most people worked from home.

455
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,740
Most people did not have to move to reach.

456
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,420
We can say they implement the employment

457
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,620
that they had or to engage in some kind of productive activity

458
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,620
that would be remunerated to gain some kind of salary

459
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,460
or profit.

460
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,820
Things-- and this is all Brussels first.

461
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,820
Brussels, the map of it, and then a view of the city center where you obviously, well,

462
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:38,460
you basically see a lot of pedestrians and not much else in terms of mobility modes.

463
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,960
This began to change with a series of inventions. First, a steam engine, an electric engine,

464
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,100
both, well, the invention started at the end of 18th century and moved also to the 19th

465
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,900
century, then the bicycle, I'm moving very fast in time,

466
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,900
and the bicycle was invented in the '60s of the 19th century.

467
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,780
I think, 1867 more or less.

468
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,260
Of course, all these inventions first

469
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,740
being curiosity, again, very luxurious goods,

470
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,340
bicycle being something that was much more used first

471
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,020
as a form of pleasure before eventually becoming

472
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,100
a mode of transport for many workers.

473
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,340
although it meant is that they gradually led to mechanization

474
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,660
of land transport systems.

475
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:34,460
And we see that gradually happening here.

476
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,540
So these different inventions,

477
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,820
particularly steam engine and nature also,

478
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,900
the discovery and discovery of the machines

479
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,260
that allow to produce electricity meant that

480
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,800
towards the end of the 19th century,

481
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,140
it appears a completely different mode of transport,

482
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,740
which revolutionizes cities of the time,

483
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,740
which is that of first a host around streetcar

484
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,020
and an electric streetcar,

485
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,180
which started to be introduced in European,

486
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,420
Western European cities, around 1890s,

487
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,340
and then became extremely popular by the 1920s.

488
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,940
That led to, well, we moved to this second state,

489
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,580
let's say, to the industrial city,

490
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:23,700
Let's do a huge revolution of how cities could be conquered by its inhabitants,

491
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,940
how they could be managed, navigated by its inhabitants.

492
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:37,100
That also allowed, or led to the decision to engage in construction of a number of underground

493
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,060
tramways, as they went for a school, the land of the ground systems first,

494
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:46,540
in London in Asia, early as 1863, then Budapest in 1896,

495
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,340
and the first Northern American system in Boston in 1897.

496
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,180
And that marked the beginning of, as I said,

497
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,740
a revolutionary change in a golden era

498
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,340
of the development of railway transport systems.

499
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,180
As railway networks expanded tremendously

500
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,740
and became the dominant land transport

501
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,940
for both passengers and for freight.

502
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,620
And that was valid or is valid

503
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,580
for both interurban and intraurban transport.

504
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,620
Why was this invention revolutionary?

505
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,520
Well, of course, because increased speed

506
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,300
allowed to cover increased distance.

507
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,400
So suddenly, for instance, the idea of still living

508
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,700
within the very medieval perimeter of the city

509
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,460
was or started to be questioned.

510
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,900
It's the idea of expanding the city to the suburb

511
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,060
or connecting the villages and the suburbs

512
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,060
to the city proper began to make a lot of sense.

513
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:45,540
So that led was one at least one of the ideas

514
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,300
why in a number of cities across Europe,

515
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,220
city walls were demolished.

516
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,100
And we see that here in Brussels.

517
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,500
So first, horse, drone, cart.

518
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,140
I think it's a photograph from the 1890s.

519
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,340
So end of the 19th century and 1910,

520
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,900
I think it's a green whale in Brussels, you already see.

521
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:13,100
I think that's, is that a horse, really in trumbly.

522
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,780
I think it actually is already, it's an electric one,

523
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,900
although I don't see the cables.

524
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,100
I thought it was an electric, but I think it might still be

525
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,260
pulled by a horse, although you don't see that from,

526
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,500
well, the trander is heading in our direction,

527
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,780
does not have a horse pulling it.

528
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,820
Right.

529
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,980
So I already mentioned this in a little bit.

530
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,980
So a revolution in urban travel, a breaking mode

531
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,260
that allowed to rethink the air reform,

532
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,060
made an impact on it in a great way.

533
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,940
Breaking this idea of a compact, dense,

534
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,820
medieval city, allowing to extend what was considered

535
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,220
to be a city to up to 20 or 30 kilometers in time,

536
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,100
if you think that the previous,

537
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,260
let's say model of a city had up to five,

538
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,260
This was an expansion of four to six times.

539
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,300
But also a PS in this process.

540
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,060
Of course, it's not all related to transport,

541
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,580
but it's happening more or less the same time.

542
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,540
And it makes a big impact on what transport is

543
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,620
in the city and what it role is,

544
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,740
is that this expansion of the urban form in space

545
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,300
allows for some specialisation of different functions,

546
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,900
especially economic functions.

547
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,980
And what it also creates,

548
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,740
or contributes to the creation of,

549
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,380
is the creation of a working class,

550
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,300
the Office of a specific group,

551
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,940
a social group of course, very diverse internally,

552
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,620
but a group that sells its time for a living,

553
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,700
that of course with the industrial revolution,

554
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,500
does that not in any more at home,

555
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,380
but actually starts what we start coming,

556
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,460
commuting to its workplace,

557
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,580
where things have been produced

558
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:07,860
the profit is being made and where the salary work is exchanged for money for a salary.

559
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:15,460
That separation, as I mentioned, being absolutely fundamental for decades of analysis of transport

560
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:23,460
to come. So, focus on this commute from work to home and vice versa. Moving to the next,

561
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:30,260
something, good to see you. Moving to the next stage of urban development, you can put it

562
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:37,060
very roughly. Of course a fundamental invention of the car, not only the invention of the car

563
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:44,660
proper because the vehicle itself, I mean we can go back to the first diesel engine invented

564
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,860
in the 90s of the 19th century, pheumatic tyre, four stroke engine, and a few years later,

565
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:55,460
and that led to the construction of the first automobile, as they were called back then in the

566
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,500
in the 1890s, but it was fundamentally the

567
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,140
classification of the current invention of this particular model,

568
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,020
which I'm sure you've--

569
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,980
or a lot of you probably have heard about already--

570
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,740
the model T by Ford, which began to be produced in 1913.

571
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,300
And famously, Mr. Ford said that this model is available

572
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,060
in any color as long as it is black.

573
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,700
The idea being that with unification of--

574
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:31,780
universalization of the model, getting rid of any options of any customization of any personalization.

575
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:42,020
And also, the implementation of today is being called Taylorism. So reaching a near automated

576
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:47,220
way of producing this vehicle with very strictly measured time for every single activity that

577
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,020
that was part of the production process.

578
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,020
The final price of the production and the final price for the consumer

579
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,860
could be reduced as much as possible,

580
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,820
meaning that this product, this commodity,

581
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,300
could be available to white masses.

582
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,140
And that does begin from the 1910s already,

583
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,780
but especially from the 1930s, when indeed the price started going

584
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,060
significantly down, the era of the automobile,

585
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,580
the era of a mode which I'm sure that if you

586
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,980
know, turn on the news about Brussels or any other Western European North American city,

587
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:29,140
but that debate also is very, very present in Minneapolis, Latin America and South Asian

588
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,740
cities. It's a mode that is very much on the agenda whenever you talk about, whenever

589
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:41,740
you hear about transport. And we're going to talk about that, I guess, tonight, if not,

590
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:47,240
in a week is a very well, is a very present mode of transport in our cities and also very

591
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:53,120
problematic mode of transport in the tracks, a lot of constipation, a lot of anger, and

592
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:59,280
a lot of creative and critical thinking in terms of what's the alternative to the automobile.

593
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,620
So it's been almost a century now that our cities, if we think about it from the global

594
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:10,860
north, are, I don't know, benefiting or suffering from that, from that long, you tell me.

595
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:17,320
from 1913 to 1927 Ford managed to build 15 million units, 15 million

596
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,340
vehicles, making it the second most produced current history right after

597
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,580
Volkswagen Beetle, which was also, they began the production a little bit later,

598
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:33,860
but also ended period between the first and second world war. So why, well,

599
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:38,860
this we've covered already mostly, but well, the most important thing here is

600
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,380
in the last bullet points.

601
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,820
I mean, why is the car such a revolutionary

602
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,500
and such an important mode of transport

603
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,540
to be mentioned here,

604
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,580
is that for the very first time mobility,

605
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,100
motorized mobility is an individual exercise.

606
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,900
It's no longer only a motorized or a horse-drawn street

607
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,020
car that allows you to cover long distances

608
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,500
of taking a train, a suburban train

609
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,020
that takes you to the factory and back.

610
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,500
But it is an individual vehicle,

611
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:14,620
an individual product that allows you to reach unprecedented levels of individual mobility.

612
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:23,900
And of course, that immediately had a very important impact on the way that the cities are planned and imagined.

613
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:36,780
Well, without running the risk of maybe a little bit of drawing some kind of caricature,

614
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:44,580
This impact starting from especially the Second World War when it was a very strong narrative

615
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:50,460
of the need of modernizing cities, especially in North America and Western Europe.

616
00:39:50,460 --> 00:40:00,980
A lot of cities became basically a perfect space for driving around a space in which huge

617
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,540
amounts of infrastructure for this individual car base mobility was built.

618
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:11,460
This process started a little bit early in the US and the 1940s and 50s already and after

619
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,900
the Second World War, that narrative was started to be very present in Western European

620
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,900
specifics.

621
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,540
Both of these images, by the way, come from a really wonderful film by Jacques T. I believe

622
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,140
is called Playtime from the 1967, which I really recommend.

623
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:32,740
He watches a great critique of this idea, this framing of modernity, which also very much

624
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,740
changes on the idea of having a car of driving around.

625
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:43,100
And well, moving to more serious stuff,

626
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,900
I mean, accommodating the car in a city meant

627
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,180
that serious infrastructure had to be built.

628
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,500
A serious self had to happen in cities at the time

629
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,540
for the car to receive this kind of space.

630
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,540
Some of the most important projects happen in the US,

631
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,540
As I mentioned on the left hand side,

632
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,420
you've got the Franklin Delano-Rousville Drive

633
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,820
and open in 1966 in New York.

634
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,100
On the right hand side,

635
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,980
the infamous Pont de Morandean,

636
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,580
and you know, in Italy 1967,

637
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,100
which unfortunately collapsed,

638
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,180
I believe, two years ago,

639
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,460
which also symbolized, of course,

640
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,420
it's a terrible event,

641
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,180
but for many,

642
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,220
it was a very powerful symbol

643
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,780
of this infrastructure crumbling

644
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,780
and an important question of what to do

645
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,780
with these relics of modernity or past modernity,

646
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,340
whether they should be, in this case, rebuilt or maintained

647
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,260
or invested in, whether this is something

648
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,740
that we want to graduate dismantle

649
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,380
and stop subsidize his maintenance of these infrastructures

650
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,380
is undoubtedly very costly.

651
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,940
And the next slide, does anybody have a clue

652
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,700
where this city is?

653
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,140
- Chalua. - Very good.

654
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,820
Well done, yes, this is the...

655
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,180
I don't remember the name of the road, but...

656
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,060
Yeah, yeah, it's in the next slide, so I'm so silly.

657
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,020
I mean, Bez is our nine built in 90,

658
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,620
or opened in 1976.

659
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,620
I don't know if you ever had the experience of driving this,

660
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,980
but it's really a time-canny.

661
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,660
It makes me personally feel as if I was in some Chinese

662
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,660
or other Asian city where you were here.

663
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,300
on this elevated platform, almost gliding through the city.

664
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,860
So it's really one of the, I think,

665
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,740
most extreme or more extreme cases,

666
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,500
at least in this part of Europe,

667
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,180
of really plowing through a city

668
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,340
to build this motorway ring route.

669
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,060
But Charlie, wow, it was not the only one.

670
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,660
I mean, we are, after all,

671
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,460
or I don't know where you are right now,

672
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,340
but most of us are in Brussels right now.

673
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,860
And Brussels was definitely also a playground

674
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,620
for many of these ideas.

675
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,780
And the idea of bringing the car and opening the city

676
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,460
to the car, like in American cities,

677
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,940
at least that was the comparison use in Belgium,

678
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,660
became particularly strong

679
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,500
and particularly potent among the political class

680
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,420
that decision makers around 1958.

681
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,860
What happened in 1958?

682
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,740
I guess you've heard that date before.

683
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,780
Any non-belgence?

684
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,540
1958, why is that important for Brussels?

685
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,180
The X-word, the X-word.

686
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,180
- That tell me.

687
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,100
- The Atomium.

688
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,260
And why would the Atomium be, well, okay,

689
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,260
the World X-flow, symbolized by the Atomium,

690
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,260
and why would that be related to the car?

691
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:47,300
You really don't have any ideas?

692
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,780
I mean, if you're opening a World X-flow

693
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,460
for the very first time in Belgium and inviting,

694
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,460
I don't remember how many people actually visited

695
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,300
the X-plain at the end,

696
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:00,500
millions of people visited the city. Why would Car be important?

697
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,340
Would the Car be important in that regard?

698
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:08,180
For putting Buzzum on the map?

699
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,900
It's worth it, Buzzum on the map.

700
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,420
The connection to go into it.

701
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,780
It's also the message.

702
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:21,620
It's to serve the idea of, I mean, not the idea, the problem of congestion is to bring

703
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,420
these masses to the Expo and back is to allow for a better communication but also to put

704
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:32,420
Belgium on the map to show that Belgium is a modern country. To show that it's on you know cutting

705
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:38,100
edge and being cutting edge in 1958 in Belgium meant opening the city for the car and building

706
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:44,020
huge infrastructure or started least to build huge infrastructure that would accommodate this new

707
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:51,620
modern US-like American way of mobility or moving around the city.

708
00:44:51,620 --> 00:45:00,900
So yeah, some things that are quite unthinkable today, we're going on at that time.

709
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:08,900
So this is Gaborne Plus, I think it's in the 1960s. So of course, Expo was a symbolic event.

710
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,900
And it didn't really, it was not just tipping points.

711
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,380
There were a lot of dynamics happening in the time

712
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,700
and the export was maybe more of a symbolic moment.

713
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,980
But it is around the time that the level of authorization

714
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,940
at the level of ownership of cars in Belgian households

715
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,140
and similar processes are mentioning Belgium here,

716
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,780
but similar things were going on in France

717
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,620
in Germany in the UK.

718
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,940
It went through the roof.

719
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,620
So it was very, very common back then

720
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,740
to invest in the car as a symbol of advancing

721
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,740
as a household as a symbol of social mobility,

722
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,300
not only a physical geograph,

723
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,860
but that of course meant that more and more space

724
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,940
had to be given to the car

725
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,740
and as the car became more present,

726
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,740
more people pulled the car.

727
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,700
So the circle was closed and there was a vicious one.

728
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,580
In Brussels specifically,

729
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,540
well, one of the most important interest structures

730
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,940
built the time is the Petit Santu,

731
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,820
so the ring road that surrounds the Pentagon of the city.

732
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,020
I'm sure that you've all been there.

733
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,980
So essentially,

734
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:17,100
the framing of it,

735
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,700
right, the actual shape of the Pentagon comes

736
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,020
from the city walls,

737
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,660
the second walls of Brussels coming from the 14th century,

738
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,660
completely destroyed,

739
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,460
which defined it as the re-center of the city still.

740
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,700
And until the 1950s,

741
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,420
it was very much an urban bulldog

742
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,780
which one could stroll and walk very much like in the drawings rather than photographs that I

743
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:42,820
showed you at the beginning from the city of walking city that was very much defined by the

744
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:52,020
pedestrian mode of moving around. In relation to the 1958s, I had to be gradually transformed.

745
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:59,220
So a series of first tunnels were built and the surface was raised to open to the car.

746
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,700
It took 20 years of work, which is not a very unusual thing in Brussels to do.

747
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,540
So two decades of extremely heavy work and very destructive work,

748
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,980
whole neighborhoods had to be relocated, destroyed, rebuilt.

749
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,820
So opened in 1976 with 15 tunnels surrounding the city.

750
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,380
Also quite importantly, and that's maybe a bit of an extreme story that

751
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,500
not necessarily happened also in France or in Germany or another,

752
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,860
Western European cities.

753
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,460
But what was very crucial in rehearsals is that the engineering team,

754
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,900
so the engineering officers, consultancy officers,

755
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,340
we call them today, would receive personal bonus on top of the salary

756
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,860
for every kilometer of an underground tunnel built.

757
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:48,500
So that led to creation of a huge push to build underground infrastructure for mobility,

758
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,020
both for cars, but also for railroad and metro.

759
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,700
And that led to a creation of very important expertise

760
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,740
in building these underground tunnels,

761
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,100
which of course, once you have that expertise,

762
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,380
you of course want to keep building more

763
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,380
because that's what you are very good at doing.

764
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,260
And that problem in Brussels,

765
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,180
well, problem situation exists until today

766
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,340
where we have huge teams of engineering,

767
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,260
specialists who specialize in building underground,

768
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,820
in steep and about the transport company in Brussels.

769
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,820
Half of the company is responsible

770
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,780
for metro for its maintenance and construction.

771
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,860
So you can imagine that what you want to do,

772
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,500
of course, is to keep building a metro,

773
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,660
which is what they are currently doing in Brussels.

774
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:35,380
Moving a little bit or zooming out a little bit from cities,

775
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,900
the large scale diffusion of the car

776
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,940
or the automobile as a mass consumption project,

777
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,780
of course, was strongly also influenced

778
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,140
or maybe also led to a dynamic,

779
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,780
to the emergence of first nationwide highway systems.

780
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:57,100
The first one created was of course the one in the US.

781
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,900
The American interstate highway system,

782
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,300
which began to be not many completely built from scratch,

783
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,540
but the first framing of it and continuous gradual addition

784
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,900
to the network in 1956.

785
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,820
Which was, of course, back then that symbol of modernity,

786
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,980
that in many other places, Belgium being one of them

787
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,020
influenced the definition of the idea

788
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,420
of what was modern or was cutting edge wars,

789
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,780
technologically advanced.

790
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,860
Today, of course, it's not the US anymore

791
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,700
that it's leading country or the leading power

792
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,900
in terms of the development of transport, technology,

793
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,220
and highways in particular.

794
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,420
That system that American system has been

795
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,540
by now surpassed definitely by the one in China.

796
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,860
The national trunk highway system here,

797
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,340
I have a little bit of an old graph,

798
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,660
but by 2011, as far as I can read it, well,

799
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,180
but already 2009, the total amount of kilometers

800
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,620
of motorways in both countries,

801
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,140
US and China was equal.

802
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,260
And the one in China, of course,

803
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,740
was rising still very steep.

804
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,420
But you can see that this, I don't like the term,

805
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,740
let's say the catching up on this idea of following a little bit in the

806
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,660
footsteps of what the Americans did in the 1950s. In China happened in an

807
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:24,260
extremely short time which not only because of the construction of the

808
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,540
motorways but this was a very important part of the construction boom meant

809
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:36,580
that from 2006 to 2007 onwards now the situation is a little bit different

810
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,540
because of the ongoing crisis and also other problems that Chinese

811
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:46,340
economy suffered from, but the consumption or the demand for concrete in China was bigger than

812
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:51,700
in all other countries around the world combined. So this was really a boom of an unprecedented

813
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:59,940
scale and we will see a few other graphs down the lecture which show us that while in many

814
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,500
cities and many countries don't know what we might be thinking that we are moving away from the

815
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,420
the current right now, but that's the idea that the other parts of the world that did

816
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:15,340
not experience this development at the same time as local North are now definitely contributing

817
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:21,500
to not even I would say persistence or vulnerability, but actually it's continuous rise

818
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:28,540
in the global scale. What was very important going back to the Belgium context of the

819
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,540
in the 1950s and 1960s.

820
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:34,540
It's also difficult to say what was first the car

821
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,340
or the suburbs or the suburbs in the car,

822
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,740
but the two were extremely strongly linked

823
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,420
with one another.

824
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,060
Having the car, and as I mentioned,

825
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,620
as I explained, the car became a very common popular

826
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,340
and cheap commodity.

827
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,380
Not only did you find how you moved to work

828
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,220
and you move around the city,

829
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,540
but actually it's again,

830
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,300
redefine what the city is.

831
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,860
So suddenly areas which would be normally considered rule

832
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,420
become accessible and become interesting for people

833
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,100
to settle in.

834
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,940
The idea also being that you have more space,

835
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,940
more freedom,

836
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:14,060
you are close to your close to nature, et cetera, et cetera.

837
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,100
These days it might feel like it's something of the past,

838
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:23,100
something that is not interesting to many urbanites

839
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,140
of today, but back then it was absolutely

840
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:33,500
way to the way to go, the way to live, the way to think that one should invest as a household

841
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:45,980
in a home market, in property market. The special results of that, the double dynamic of

842
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:53,180
motorization of one hand, suborganization of the other, was that if a pre industrial city had a

843
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:58,860
more or less 10% of its space devoted to transport and mobility. An industrial

844
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:07,340
modern city has between 15 and 30% and that's rough estimates from Western Europe to up to 60%

845
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:14,380
in some American cities of space will be given to mobility infrastructure which is principally

846
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:22,220
highways and parking lots, which of course is a huge spatial cost.

847
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:30,220
And, well, another development, of course, is that the commuting area that we start to call it,

848
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:38,220
so the actual definition of what a city is, regardless of administrative limits and different boundaries,

849
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:45,220
of course, this would be often divided into some municipalities and all, it goes up to 100 kilometres in diameter.

850
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,220
So suddenly what is a city becomes,

851
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:53,220
it stands becoming a little bit vague in the sense that the old urban course,

852
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:59,220
of course, do not hold all the functions anymore and we start seeing cities,

853
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,220
expanding at least in economic terms.

854
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:14,220
Well, without running into the risk of simplifying things a little bit too much,

855
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:26,220
But what happened in a lot of cities, both in North America and in Western Europe, is that as the car became more and more popular and as moving by car became absolutely common.

856
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:34,220
And if you basically had a middle-class job, that's what you did. You lived in the suburbs and you created through the office job by car.

857
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,900
Trans-and companies, or mass transit companies,

858
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,960
probably transport companies,

859
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,740
started to run into serious financial difficulties.

860
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:47,180
So traditionally, when they were actually set up

861
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:51,220
in the 19th century, 1910s, 1920s,

862
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,860
they would be private companies very often,

863
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,900
private railroads bringing workers

864
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,180
to the suburbs in Darchle, bringing the bourgeois

865
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,860
and people who wanted to enjoy leisure

866
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,220
outside of the city and then back.

867
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:07,220
As they started to run into trouble in some countries,

868
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,100
and that's usually the case in Western Europe,

869
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,100
they would be nationalized.

870
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,700
They would be taken over by the state

871
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,900
as an important part of military infrastructure,

872
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,620
but also an important part of mobility infrastructure

873
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,580
and kept, but they enrolled the societal role

874
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,700
with definitely declined,

875
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,940
so they would become something not necessarily

876
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,860
for the middle class, but rather for the working class.

877
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:32,580
Belgium here is some sort of an exception

878
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,060
because a lot of commuting here,

879
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:38,020
due to the fact that the railway system was traditionally

880
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:42,460
been very dense, happened and still is happening

881
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,980
very much through public transport.

882
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,380
But that's definitely not the case in the UK, for example,

883
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,540
or definitely not in North America.

884
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,220
But, and sticking to North America,

885
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:55,260
in a number of cities over there,

886
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,220
the process that happened was inverse.

887
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,940
So the decline of public transit did not

888
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,500
lead to any investment by the state.

889
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,140
either on federal or on the state-state level,

890
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,860
but rather eventually dismantling

891
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,860
of public transport systems happened.

892
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,260
And a very particular story is that of the general

893
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,420
modus company.

894
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,980
So one of the main producers of these masks

895
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,700
come on with these with the cars.

896
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,580
Who threw out the 1940s basically bought

897
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,460
a number of public transport companies,

898
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,580
massive companies as they are called over there.

899
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,580
and purposely led to the decline.

900
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:33,420
Why?

901
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,220
Well, the idea was quite simple.

902
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,220
It was basically the derivative of the competition

903
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:41,100
that public transport could have posed

904
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,020
to the individual ability to the car.

905
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:48,060
So the idea was to push public transport out of the market.

906
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:52,860
And again, I just saw the comment from somebody.

907
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:57,100
And again, yes, the idea of course

908
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,380
was that this was also framed by the discourse

909
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,900
of modernity and advancing as a society.

910
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,940
I forgot to mention that we will be taking a break

911
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,980
in both today and in the week.

912
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,980
I don't think that sticking to the stream

913
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,740
to ours is a helpful thing to do.

914
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,700
So we will take a break actually in three minutes

915
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,580
probably for about five minutes.

916
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,380
And just in case you're getting a little bit tight.

917
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:26,260
But this total decline or some would even say it is up

918
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,980
I would even say a disaster in terms of what happened to mass transport, mass transit,

919
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,380
sorry, public transport was not always the case.

920
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:38,500
So as I already mentioned, in some countries, public transport networks actually were

921
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,060
taken over by the state and even invested in.

922
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:47,220
And one important thing that happened, or a symbolic project that happened is that of Copenhagen's

923
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,860
fingerplant from 1947.

924
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:55,100
So basically there, the decision was made to create an alternative, or maybe not a substitute,

925
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,980
an alternative parallel to car commuting.

926
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:03,240
Basically suburban rail, which follows the shape of fine figures.

927
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,700
Corridors that would not only be transport corridors,

928
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,620
but also along which a number of different functions,

929
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,620
especially residential, but also economic work,

930
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:17,420
related functions would be placed as well.

931
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,420
And that was, as far as I know, one of the first plans

932
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:23,360
that try to achieve what we call

933
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,680
transport-oriented development, or development

934
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,240
urban development that happens around, or in this particular case,

935
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:33,800
along transport corridors to allow for different mobility

936
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,400
options back then, maybe, environmental issues

937
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,120
were not so much on the agenda, but the idea

938
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,120
was that people would be able to get more efficiently

939
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:46,120
to work, not only by car, but also by suburban rail.

940
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:51,800
In our lovely Brussels, well, things were not so easy,

941
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,840
Well, things were a little bit in between.

942
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,760
So on the one hand, the car was definitely the king.

943
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,760
And actually it's one of the slogans in Brussels

944
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,000
sent it academia and public debate.

945
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,640
Car it became the king around the 1950s

946
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,320
with the expo of the 1958.

947
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,400
And still very much is a very present

948
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,960
and very privileged lot of transport.

949
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,320
But public transport, of course, did not

950
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,560
disappear on one of the particularities of Brussels

951
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,240
is that unlike in Sharawa, for example,

952
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,560
or many cities in Germany or in France,

953
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,120
especially Trang was, for example,

954
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,920
were never completely dismantled.

955
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,640
And you would see, and I can't think of any specific names

956
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,200
right now in France, but there are cities in which

957
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,280
Trang, way network existed, you know, 1940s, '50s and '60s,

958
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,360
and then was completely dismantled to open a surface space

959
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,600
to the car.

960
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,360
So what happened in Brussels is that the Trang was basically

961
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,480
put on the ground, so you see on top left,

962
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,840
Rinalalwa, which is that magnificent open waterway these days.

963
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,680
And you see a tram trying to plow its way

964
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,120
through the city, standing in a traffic jam.

965
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,000
The idea, well, of course, the city has packed

966
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,480
the spaces limited with the rise of mobility

967
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,560
and the individual mobility.

968
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,600
And the rise of an hour of course, traffic jams happen.

969
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,120
The decision there was made not to make more space

970
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:19,560
the tram would make to make more space for the car. So a strategic decision was to put the tram

971
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:26,200
first underground, creating a very particular mode of transport made in Brussels called pre-metro

972
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:33,960
kamitho, which then eventually as it was actually planned was converted into a full scale,

973
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,680
as we call it in Brussels, heavy metro metrolu. You can actually see a pre-metrol still,

974
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:43,800
and that's line three and four in Brussels at Tramline that goes from north to south of the Pentagon,

975
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:49,720
which as you probably have heard is now well will soon be converted into a proper

976
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,240
metro of once and a new metro line from the gallery knob and northwards is constructed.

977
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:01,080
So you get for example C, I don't know if you ever had a chance of you know noting that the

978
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,760
platforms and although this is a trans stock the platforms are actually much much wider than

979
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,960
and usually would be in the case of a tram

980
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,720
and they are much longer.

981
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,440
Basically they were built,

982
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,280
I think already back in the 70s,

983
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,800
anticipating a proper metro, we are now in 2020.

984
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,040
So if I need a metro, it's happening,

985
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,000
although well, it's a controversial project to sit at least.

986
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,200
Let's take a little break here,

987
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,600
not longer than five, six minutes.

988
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,320
So grab another tea, you're a coffee,

989
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,000
and I'll see you back in four, five minutes, all right?

990
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,760
Great, I'm going to see you in a moment.

Welcome back all of you. I hope you grabbed another drink or whatever it is that you are

having. Grab another notebook to keep helping things, although of course you've got the

1055
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:55,460
recording of all this. And I can see that some people are asking questions. I might also

1056
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:01,140
ask you with up to now, up to now everything has been clear or you've got any questions

1057
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:06,420
about what I've been talking about. If yes, please raise your hand, just speak up. But I think

1058
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:13,780
it's an interesting question that Mika asked here in the chat, whether in need what's happening

1059
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:20,100
right now is that we have an increased desire for what we could say is a pre-industrial city,

1060
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:28,420
a city of walking of short distances, density of uses, mixes. Does anybody have an opinion on this?

1061
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,900
Would you agree? Would you not agree?

1062
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:40,180
Or maybe Mika, whether he or she is, has an opinion?

1063
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:50,020
It's me. Yeah, I wasn't sure if it's really linked to the pre-industrial city, but when you explained

1064
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:56,420
how it was looking, how it looked like.

1065
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:00,660
I thought about actually it's exactly what today's planning is about.

1066
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:12,580
Like this mixed use, this like, and narrow streets where you workability and short distances.

1067
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:17,300
And I mean, maybe it's also really a European perspective.

1068
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:26,020
I'm not sure about that. I thought maybe it could be like a new role model of today's planning.

1069
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:30,740
Does anybody have an opinion on this? Would anybody like to react?

1070
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:46,740
I can compare it for example in Antroop. I live in the center of the city.

1071
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:54,500
but we see that the place for private cars is reducing.

1072
01:08:54,500 --> 01:09:02,420
For example, they put parking lots under undergrounds for making some leisure activities or parks

1073
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:09,860
or something else. So we see a movement, I guess, when we focus on that. And definitely in Brussels,

1074
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:13,700
depending on the policy now, it's more ecological

1075
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:20,180
minus and we see more opportunities to reduce

1076
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:26,420
parking lots and more movements like for example in Anspaklam.

1077
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:31,220
In the Kitton years it's called the pedestrian area of Brussels.

1078
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,020
Yeah yeah.

1079
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:36,260
We couldn't imagine I guess 20 years ago so we see different movements.

1080
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,180
Yeah, there is definitely some kind of shift happening.

1081
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:46,020
I mean, we are not in the 1960s or 70s, not where what is right now on this slide.

1082
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:50,420
Things have moved on. The presence of the car is definitely put on the question.

1083
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:53,700
But is this about going to a three-industrial city?

1084
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:54,980
What would be the problem with that?

1085
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:59,940
Or would be the risk of just to revert into walking, let's say,

1086
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,420
if that's what the pre-industrial city was about.

1087
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:10,020
as anybody have, you know, an opinion on this. There was no wrong answers here.

1088
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:16,260
We tell you saying that new mobility plans are aiming in the best of use of all technologies

1089
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:23,460
we have now with maximum inclusivity. Yeah, I guess so. Proof is in the, you know,

1090
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:29,780
well, it depends on how they, of course, implemented and it's the idea, of course, is that

1091
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,780
that everybody is included and we use all the technologies we have.

1092
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:36,280
In practice, we will see that it's a little bit complicated.

1093
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:46,780
Maybe it's also the light when we were looking at the metro system that it's more about underground transportation.

1094
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:49,280
So like separation.

1095
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,380
Okay.

1096
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,880
Transportation systems.

1097
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,480
Somebody else started talking. Who was that?

1098
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:28,380
Yeah, that was me. And also what I wanted to bring up was this idea of Brussels is a productive city where industries or small businesses are still located and where people can have, you know, can find jobs almost in their neighborhood that it, you know, especially maybe jobs that don't necessarily pay so well that wouldn't be interesting for other people to to commute into the city to. And I think these kind of businesses are a bit under pressure from.

1099
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:34,380
the reduction in space that they have on, you know, to organize these productive activities.

1100
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:42,380
So I think, yeah, space in front of their, in front of the street, to actually do their deliveries.

1101
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:48,860
And I think as a tension there in the kind of city, you want, and the way you want the service,

1102
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:56,860
different neighborhoods and different areas. So one of the cases was like these smaller construction,

1103
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:01,860
and supplies kind of stores, maybe in the area of LAC and,

1104
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,300
like not far from the canal,

1105
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:08,940
serving a kind of secondary places where,

1106
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,420
you just wouldn't go to Brico

1107
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:14,380
for those kind of materials, you would go to your neighborhood

1108
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:18,780
and that's becoming harder to maintain

1109
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:22,220
in an urban environment that gives more space to walking

1110
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:29,660
to buy claims and so on. So that's on the one side. It doesn't mean that I agree, but it's,

1111
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:37,580
I think one of the pressures that is being felt by that group.

1112
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:41,980
I guess what's important what you said, and to relate it also to what I was talking about

1113
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:45,980
before and what Vitali there is, the right thing is that there is some with each of these

1114
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:51,900
technological shifts. Of course, they are very, I mean, it's a very broad sketch. These things

1115
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,620
when all happening in sudden turns, it's a process.

1116
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:59,380
But space is valorised in different ways.

1117
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:04,380
And for example, if we see here in this slide, as I mentioned,

1118
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,260
clearly space became very limited with the rise of the cars.

1119
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,820
And the decision was made of the space is extremely valuable.

1120
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,860
And it should be given to the modes that

1121
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,980
is the most efficient in terms of speed,

1122
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:18,620
as the most rational mode also, not only economically

1123
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:20,740
or temporally efficient.

1124
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:24,740
So other modes like public transport, I haven't even mentioned cycling there,

1125
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:28,340
had to disappear or be moved elsewhere.

1126
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:30,860
And I think what's happening right now is some kind of

1127
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,540
revolarization of space.

1128
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,900
But space is always limited.

1129
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:40,260
So if you take it, I mean, if you give it to one or some set of users,

1130
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:44,420
which I think also, perhaps we will have time to talk about it next week,

1131
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,980
has a clear class component.

1132
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:53,820
So there is a clear middle class idea behind opening central airman spaces to walking, cycling,

1133
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:56,940
and public transport and taking it away from the car.

1134
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,500
So if you give it to these kind of users, you have to take it away from others, in this

1135
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,380
case, the car.

1136
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:07,020
And I think an important question is to ask, well, if we want the car to disappear from

1137
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,740
the city life, from Russell's, who is using the car, right?

1138
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:17,740
me who is dependent on it. For example, these businesses, small shops that, I don't know,

1139
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:23,100
either, well, I mean, the productive activity requires accessibility by cow. But also, I think,

1140
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:29,500
probably you've heard right now in this pandemic crazy times, people are talking about 15 minute

1141
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:35,580
neighbourhood and the idea of how the pandemic has shown us that we can, well, since we

1142
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:40,460
essentially, and many of us stop a lot of activities. We start walking around and cycling and all that.

1143
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:46,380
So the idea that maybe we could use this to reorganize the cities around 15 minute

1144
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:51,180
perimeters walking perimeters within which we can all find all the users and functions that we need.

1145
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:57,340
But I think an important question there is who actually lives so close to a good school,

1146
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:04,140
a good job and all that. And in Perasos, many other cities, there will be a lot of people who need to

1147
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,660
to find employment quite far from where they live.

1148
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:10,260
And a lot of them would have to go by car

1149
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,860
to get to that job.

1150
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,740
So what, you know, what then,

1151
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:19,140
I will continue with the lecture,

1152
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:23,020
but I hope there will be space for more questions.

1153
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,940
There was one point that I want to make

1154
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:27,540
that is, you know, I don't want to say

1155
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:30,220
a main conclusion of this historical trajectory,

1156
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,180
but I think an important point

1157
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,780
to keep in mind, you know, this is that

1158
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:41,460
it's not just a descriptive, you know,

1159
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,900
to the force of what different modes of transport

1160
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,820
were there and how it impacted the urban form.

1161
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,820
I think this is something that is maybe

1162
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,260
a little bit interesting, but essentially,

1163
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,420
I don't think it's very critical

1164
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,740
and doesn't really allow us to understand

1165
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,860
too much about how the city functions are functioned

1166
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:57,860
in the past.

1167
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,540
I think what's very important though

1168
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,100
is that with each of these shifts,

1169
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:04,860
with each of these turning points and dynamics

1170
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:08,900
that led to shift in terms of how people move.

1171
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:12,380
We're getting closer and closer to the situation

1172
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:14,340
that we have today, which is that transport

1173
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:17,180
is absolutely crucial not only for the development

1174
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:22,020
of cities, but for the development of the socioeconomic system

1175
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,700
in which we live today on the global scale,

1176
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:27,740
which is of global capitalism.

1177
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:31,860
So it would be impossible for the current socioeconomic relations

1178
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,740
to develop to the point that they have developed

1179
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:36,460
without transport and without the development of transport

1180
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:37,260
and vice versa.

1181
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,580
So outside of the capitalist system,

1182
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:42,300
they probably would not have been such a push

1183
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,580
for development of individual mobility, for example,

1184
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,940
and the visual mobility by car that is propelled

1185
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:51,300
by fossil fuels with all the geopolitical

1186
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:55,740
and environmental atrocities and impacts that this produces.

1187
01:16:55,740 --> 01:17:19,740
Essentially transport or transport geography is a discipline required space not only to be conquered physically in terms of distance basically moving from A to B would become as fast as short of a time as possible, but also some kind of imaginary and cartographical colonisation of concrete of space.

1188
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:25,820
If we go back to end of the 18th century, for example, in Europe, well, the majority of

1189
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:30,380
people who inhabited, well, maybe eight of the 17th century to be a little bit less controversial,

1190
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:34,380
but the majority of people who lived on our continent and definitely the majority of people

1191
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:39,820
who lived on our planet did not live under jurisdiction of any state or any state administration.

1192
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:45,180
They essentially lived outside the state structures. Of course, states and administration existed,

1193
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:51,740
But most people lived in villages in areas where once in a while, a tax collector would

1194
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:56,460
maybe show up or be quite easy to avoid the encounter with that kind of gentleman,

1195
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:00,460
rather not gentle moment, I'm afraid.

1196
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:05,260
So it's at this point, and I think transport is absolutely crucial for understanding of

1197
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:09,580
why this happened and how this happened, that there happened or the beginning to happen

1198
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:13,580
in a strategic expansion of state infrastructure and state administration.

1199
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:18,540
predominantly related security reasons and search for different forms of capital,

1200
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:25,980
for instance, slavery, so trying to reach different places where bodies could be snatched,

1201
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,620
taken into captivity and then sold or propelled into productivity.

1202
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:36,620
But for the state to be able to organize this process, it had to develop its

1203
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:42,620
cartography, it has to develop its dominance, its knowledge, its control over space.

1204
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:49,180
And here we see a map of France in the 1632, which is essentially, well, we've seen some roads,

1205
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:56,540
we see some cities and connections between those. But this radically changes with the

1206
01:18:56,540 --> 01:19:01,180
development of state's interest in terms of the resources, as I mentioned, bodies, people,

1207
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:08,300
but also of course other natural resources would anything that you can mine and I don't know

1208
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:13,420
it's not especially here in terms of who you can be interested in as a state but what essentially

1209
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:19,660
happened is that from a natural space, a space that was inhabited, a space that was lived,

1210
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:28,460
we started moving into a fire name of abstracted of of absolute space that is very much related

1211
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:35,020
to the consolidation of states infrastructure as a way of organizing social and material order

1212
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:40,220
that is on the ground to bureaucratically govern it to rule it from the distance, from a very top

1213
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:45,660
down perspective. The example of France is very interesting because literally over there the decision

1214
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:52,700
was made of course not immediately in one meeting but progressively it was a state bureaucracy

1215
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:58,940
a rather decision to divide the state in more or less equally shaped areas, the departments

1216
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:04,620
based on a regular grid. On the left hand side you see there's some kind of conceptualization of

1217
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:10,300
this. On the right hand side we see a result which is the actual, the eventual division. I think one

1218
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:16,300
of the first ones in the French territory. I think today of course it's not exactly the same that

1219
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:19,460
has developed for different historical reasons.

1220
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,460
But the idea was very important.

1221
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:25,820
The Ministry of Reform of the 1790

1222
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:30,020
would replace an old feudal tribal, even division

1223
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:33,300
of territories into--

1224
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:36,100
it would be your place with abstract bureaucratic logic

1225
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,340
that would be applied in a more or less the same way

1226
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:46,180
in each of these territories, each of these departments.

1227
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,180
this week in skip.

1228
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:51,300
What was very important in this development

1229
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:58,300
is that the state needed very much universal,

1230
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,620
I don't know how to put it, a reliable system

1231
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:05,100
of measuring space and other related phenomena,

1232
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,260
such as, for example, time and quantity.

1233
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:10,700
It might be very difficult for us to imagine this,

1234
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:14,380
but the unification of measuring systems

1235
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:19,100
of time and space and quantity was something that took a very long time and it was definitely not

1236
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:26,060
in place until end of the even 17 or 18 centuries. So it took a very long time to actually make sure

1237
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:32,380
- sorry - make sure that all inhabitants of a given nation state of a given territory would actually

1238
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:37,660
subjugate themselves to the usage of a unified - that's the word I was looking for - unified

1239
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:43,500
metric or measurement system. So for example the unification of the metric systems in Germany took

1240
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:50,460
place in as late as 1868 in Austria in 1871 and Hungary three years later in Russia in 1919

1241
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:56,940
and in China only in 1959. What does it mean? It means that there exist of course ways of measuring

1242
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:01,500
but there will be culturally dependent or there will be spatially dependent. So a particular

1243
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:08,700
unit of measurement, a foot, an elbow would mean different things and different villages.

1244
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,060
It would mean different things at a different times of the day or year. It would mean different

1245
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:18,540
things whether it would be the activity of selling or buying. For example, you would sell

1246
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:26,380
a small bag of rice and buy a big one. There was a difference between that's in many pre-colonial,

1247
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:32,540
African communities, kingdoms. There will be a division between strong measures for selling

1248
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:39,100
goods and weak measures for buying goods. So there was a huge diversity of different ways of

1249
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:43,180
measuring space, measuring time, and measuring quantity.

1250
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:47,260
All that in all the, and also because of, and again,

1251
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:50,380
this is a two-way dynamic, the development of the transport

1252
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:53,420
system and the development of state as an institution

1253
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:56,140
or a set of institutions that had to control space,

1254
01:22:56,140 --> 01:23:01,860
quantity, and time gave way to a unified system,

1255
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:04,580
of which transport is absolutely central in here.

1256
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:08,340
I mean, the symbolic one meter, which is, of course,

1257
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:14,420
huge upstream agreement that we are in, that this is what one meter is, and the same could be said

1258
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:20,900
about the kilogram of the second and many others. Moving a little bit more, going a little bit

1259
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:27,300
more into transport here, I mentioned time and for example as late as in the late 18th century,

1260
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:31,860
distance between particular cities and as a result travel times between particular cities,

1261
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:37,380
such as in Germany, we're not fixed or set.

1262
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:41,380
So in 1881, German railways or different kinds of German

1263
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:43,300
railways because there was no one national system

1264
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,900
followed to five different times us, which

1265
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:49,380
were different not by one hour but by a different amount of minutes,

1266
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:52,660
which meant that basically one area, I guess,

1267
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:57,140
the archaea color coded, would be five or seven minutes ahead of the other one,

1268
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,780
which meant that the passengers had to do the calculation themselves.

1269
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:06,340
it was all an oral agreement and an ongoing discussion between the passengers and the staff

1270
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:12,180
to understand what time things would happen, what time the train would depart, leave, etc.

1271
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:23,780
And as I mentioned, this integration of measurement system, integration of different modes of

1272
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:28,020
of transport networks allowed the state to control,

1273
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:33,620
to consolidate the territory, and to basically be able

1274
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:37,060
to develop socioeconomic relations that we take today

1275
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:40,780
very much for granted.

1276
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,620
This was absolutely crucial.

1277
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,780
I mean, the reason why I'm making this a bit of a digression

1278
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:47,820
and the departure from historic trajectories

1279
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:51,300
that this was absolutely crucial, this colonisation of space

1280
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,420
and colonization of what we consider to be

1281
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,940
a very much of a social or good consideration,

1282
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:59,140
social activity, movement and transport is,

1283
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,540
was absolutely crucial for the development of,

1284
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:03,340
again, what we take very much for granted,

1285
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:07,220
the global networks of YS, cables, railroads,

1286
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:08,420
highways in this particular case,

1287
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:12,300
I already showed you that map,

1288
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:17,300
allowing transport to lubricate the capitalist global system.

1289
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:22,060
And today, this colonization of space,

1290
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:25,140
if we can call it this way, it's no longer a national matter,

1291
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:27,340
it's no longer nation-states that are propelling this process.

1292
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:30,660
It's something that has happened very much on the global scale.

1293
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:36,860
What was very important in this very long trajectory

1294
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,860
started very quickly at the end of the 17th century.

1295
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:41,780
Now we are in 1950s.

1296
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:45,140
What was very important is that the whole science developed

1297
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:49,780
around this colonization of different measuring systems

1298
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:54,260
of different ways of living and interacting with space.

1299
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:58,060
And this size, on this scientific field,

1300
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,420
I think we can call it a set of neoclassical perspectives

1301
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:05,940
on not only transport, also on economics, on social life,

1302
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:09,420
which in transport itself is very much present,

1303
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,620
is very much dominated by, on the 100 transport engineers,

1304
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,820
on the other and the transcoli economists.

1305
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:20,420
What I'm talking about here is basically the main, say,

1306
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,460
and I will not talk a lot about this,

1307
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:27,060
but basically if you went to a master degree,

1308
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,340
which I'm very happy you did it,

1309
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:31,380
but if you went to a master degree in transport management

1310
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:34,220
or logistics at any technical university,

1311
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:36,020
this is very much what you would be learning today,

1312
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:38,620
which I guess at this time of the day or night,

1313
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,940
which we are a bit more boring, I hope,

1314
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:45,060
and what I have to offer, but hope there is no regrets here

1315
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,900
in the room today.

1316
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,780
But if you want to be an engineer,

1317
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:49,500
and if you want to be an economist to go rose,

1318
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,260
this is basically what you learn.

1319
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,540
Why is it called Neoplastico Transport?

1320
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:57,140
Well, very much it relates to Neoplastico Economics,

1321
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:01,380
which deals with a cold, blooded analysis,

1322
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,660
a study of distribution, production of goods,

1323
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:07,340
outputs, and income through.

1324
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:10,180
And that's absolutely crucial supply and demand.

1325
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:15,980
So a system which has to be an equivalent equilibrium,

1326
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:23,180
which essentially looks at transport as a part or a separate market in which transport

1327
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:33,700
is a good commodity which is offered in the market, passengers being its consumers.

1328
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:34,700
What is important here?

1329
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:39,700
There are two main principles, which very much today, again,

1330
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:42,540
in academia, but also very much in the world of practitioners.

1331
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:45,020
So the world of those who plan roads, who build roads,

1332
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:47,020
who claim that we need a new metro line,

1333
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:50,260
we need a more to way, or that this or that particular mode

1334
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,020
of transport is absolutely essential

1335
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:55,140
for contemporary cities to thrive.

1336
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:57,580
So these two dogmas say that on the one hand,

1337
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:01,180
transport is an essentially rational discipline.

1338
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:07,180
It's a discipline that is rational because it has to be developed by experts.

1339
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:12,580
It's a top-down discipline that requires it to top-down cartographic vision of space,

1340
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:17,180
which can reduce to its absolute universal measures.

1341
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:24,180
That also means that there is a science behind it, which means that it's not an issue that can be fully open to a public debate.

1342
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:37,180
It's a part of urban life that has to be developed by experts and only experts can have the final word in terms of decision-making, in terms of how transpose develops, why, and using what modes.

1343
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:43,180
There is a very strong prediction there in this field of knowledge,

1344
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:48,460
transport geography or transport economics and engineering are essentially objective sciences.

1345
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:53,180
They are much more on the side of science and sciences and humanities for example.

1346
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:56,180
They purpose being pursuing objectivity and truth.

1347
01:28:56,180 --> 01:29:01,500
It's a quote from another very important textbook on transport geography.

1348
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:06,820
The idea being that we can arrive some kind of absolute truth in terms of what is good transport

1349
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:13,140
and what is bad, which essentially are translatable, transferable from one locality to

1350
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:22,280
went out. So if we go back to the 1950s, if the US cities develop motorways and develop

1351
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:26,380
car infrastructure, which is efficient at rational, this is a solution that can also work

1352
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:32,100
in dense medieval European cities such as the ones in Belgium to just Brussels, for

1353
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,060
example.

1354
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:40,380
Crucially, this line of thinking and that maybe didn't develop in the end of the 17th

1355
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:46,120
in the 19th century, but was definitely a result of this process that I called the colonization

1356
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:53,700
of space. This field of thinking and producing transport is consolidated itself around the

1357
01:29:53,700 --> 01:30:01,460
1930s and 40s and that propelled measurements and engineering studies that allowed to construct

1358
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:08,420
these interurban and intraurban motorway systems. And this very much continues today following

1359
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:12,420
a rule of predicting demand for mobility,

1360
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:16,340
predicting passenger flows or traffic flows

1361
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:20,100
and providing necessary infrastructure for it.

1362
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,900
So basically most of transport,

1363
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:27,540
most of what transport models do is predict

1364
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:30,980
where would these flows go and provide

1365
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:35,140
essential infrastructure and extension of a road lane,

1366
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:36,740
a construction of a new motorway,

1367
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:41,140
construction of the new metro line, you name it.

1368
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:45,100
So that's one part of the rationality of transport.

1369
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:48,380
The other part is that the assumption is that the user itself

1370
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:54,780
and it's, yeah, the user itself is also a rational being.

1371
01:30:54,780 --> 01:31:01,020
It's a homo, economic, it's an economically minded being

1372
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:05,580
that almost on a regular basis, on a daily basis,

1373
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:11,300
conduct some kind of economic analysis in terms of what is an efficient way of reaching

1374
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:19,100
an destination B from point A in terms of time, in terms of cost, being, making pragmatic

1375
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:25,340
free and very much utility-based choices in terms of how to move and where to move.

1376
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:32,180
So in other words, a market, a market that is being governed by the laws of economics,

1377
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:38,340
very much in this line of thought are being compared to the loss of physics. A lot of these models

1378
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:44,660
would have, for example, illusions to gravity, so gravity, models that in a natural light way

1379
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:50,100
pulls, flows of passengers to some destinations rather than others because for example, economic

1380
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:58,100
and connectivity is present in an area. So that's principle of dogma number one. Number two is that

1381
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:06,340
But there is this very strong conviction and funny enough, still not fully proven, but the

1382
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:11,980
conviction is very much there, that investment in transport infrastructure, of course,

1383
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:13,860
that part is not controversial.

1384
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:19,140
Least of high speeds, leads to low and travel times, leads to lower transaction costs

1385
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:24,140
if you want to move from A to B or sell for some goods, it's basically cheaper, leads

1386
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,700
to economic development.

1387
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:30,080
So the better infrastructure we have, the higher or the better

1388
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,420
the growth of a locality.

1389
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:36,620
So if you want the city to be economically prosperous,

1390
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:42,580
wealthy, you need quality transport infrastructure.

1391
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:50,660
So that very much is underpinned by this quarter

1392
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:51,940
that I already mentioned earlier today,

1393
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:54,060
that the unique purpose of transport is, in fact,

1394
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:57,580
to limit, to reduce space and time that is needed

1395
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,900
to cover the space to zero,

1396
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:04,020
so that that is the unique purpose of movement in the city,

1397
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,580
which also means that the travel time itself

1398
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,660
is an unproductive activity,

1399
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,220
because from the monetary perspective,

1400
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,220
if you want to go from A to B,

1401
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:14,220
well, you want to get there as quickly as possible.

1402
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,700
The time of getting there itself

1403
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:18,100
is not a valuable activity.

1404
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:20,700
Now, there are, I mean, there was a flurry of problems here,

1405
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:23,140
starting from the fact that if you actually ask people

1406
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,940
through studies, what they do when they take the metro

1407
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:29,020
or where they cycle, which is such a complicated

1408
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,900
and multi-faceted activity.

1409
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:34,180
They often say that this is actually a very important part

1410
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:37,100
of the day, that commuting on public transport, for example,

1411
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,660
allows them to catch up with friends, to read,

1412
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:43,220
to relax, to meditate, cycling being,

1413
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:45,340
as I mentioned, multi-faceted activity

1414
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:48,100
that allows people to get relaxed, work out,

1415
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:52,380
get an endorphin kick and all that.

1416
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:57,380
And that's so much more than just moving from one place to another.

1417
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:04,500
But again, without trying to draw some kind of caricature,

1418
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:09,180
I think it's important to understand that this way of thinking about transport

1419
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:13,020
leads us to a formulation of an absolutely fundamental problem

1420
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:17,180
in inverted commons that a lot of engineers, transport engineers,

1421
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:18,780
and transport economists recognize.

1422
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:20,620
And that problem is congestion.

1423
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:25,620
if you focus on fluid flow of passengers, cars,

1424
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:28,820
whatever the transport mode is,

1425
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,380
any obstruction to that flow,

1426
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:34,540
any obstruction to that model is a problem that has to be solved.

1427
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:36,260
And that problem has to be solved

1428
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,540
because otherwise the system is irrational.

1429
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:40,060
So that's number one.

1430
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:43,220
And the second reason is that,

1431
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:46,660
unless you do that, you can

1432
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:53,700
the economic growth, economic development of the locality that you are in in in charge of.

1433
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:59,780
As I mentioned this this beneficial, supposed to be beneficial relationship between

1434
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:04,580
transport development and economic development. So better roads, I mean better transport,

1435
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:09,860
better exchange of goods and services. That of course works to some extent. I mean you can

1436
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:16,420
you can see that having theoretically at least from scratch in in many cities in many countries

1437
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:21,220
from the global south. But then this relation has never really been theorized, it's never

1438
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:27,300
really been proven. And it will be extremely difficult to make that claim in cities that

1439
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:31,860
are postmodern, such as Brussels or many other cities in the global north, but actually increasing

1440
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:37,060
the global south. So addition of infrastructure, especially road infrastructure, current

1441
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:43,700
infrastructure, and it's anticipated impact in terms of economic growth, economic development,

1442
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:49,160
It's a very controversial issue that, well, it's not really, we don't have any tangible

1443
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:55,400
proof or the tangible enough to say with certainty that this is the case.

1444
01:35:55,400 --> 01:36:01,380
But it's an argument that you can hear a lot, including in Brussels and Belgium.

1445
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,380
Is this clear?

1446
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:04,500
Do you have any questions?

1447
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:08,780
This is usually where people are scratching the hands a little bit, so I want to make

1448
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:11,820
sure that you are okay.

1449
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:19,260
nobody is running anything in a chat, no angry comments, I keep advancing here then.

1450
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:24,460
So what happens when you believe that what you do is rational and it's very important

1451
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:27,180
for society, for economy?

1452
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:34,660
Well, you essentially engage in developing more and more and more elaborate and complicated

1453
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:37,780
mathematical models that try to predict.

1454
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:39,820
not only to describe what's happening

1455
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:43,740
but actually trying to predict what is going to happen.

1456
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:46,060
What is now happening very much in the business

1457
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:48,300
of transport economics and transport engineering

1458
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,020
is modeling human behavior.

1459
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:53,540
So trying to predict where people will be interested

1460
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:55,140
in going and not anymore,

1461
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:57,420
where they are actually are heading

1462
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,380
and where these flows are being distributed

1463
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,540
in an urban environment.

1464
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:04,260
What's crucial here is that this field is extremely,

1465
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:06,140
not only extremely technical and quantitative,

1466
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:08,100
whether it's very descriptive,

1467
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:11,180
so this logic of transport supply and transport demands

1468
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:16,180
is devoid of any social, cultural, political relations.

1469
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:20,420
When I say that a transport user

1470
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,500
is homo-economic, is considered to be

1471
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:26,700
a this rational utility-based person or figure

1472
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:28,500
that makes these rational choices

1473
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,700
in terms of whether or how any issue of gender,

1474
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:36,700
an issue of class, of ethnicity, of age is at best mentioned,

1475
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:40,380
but given a very little weight,

1476
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:41,820
if we are talking about modeling,

1477
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,780
so these different aspects can be given

1478
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:46,540
different weights, given different importance,

1479
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:49,260
importance, different levels of importance.

1480
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:52,500
And these issues are quite simply not there.

1481
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,860
And of course, we will be discussing this a little bit.

1482
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:57,260
I mean, these different critical approaches,

1483
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:02,260
such as some anti-capitalist Marxist, feminist,

1484
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:06,780
and eranical theory, social theory,

1485
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:10,100
the exposure to those in engineering programs

1486
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:13,620
is close to none, which basically means

1487
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,180
that without trying to be too critical

1488
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:18,780
about their genius who are trying to do their job,

1489
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,700
basically they are really not aware

1490
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:23,340
of the complexity of social relations

1491
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,020
and spatial relations that are happening in cities.

1492
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:31,820
So everything that you've learned with David Barson Nick by now, this is simply not there.

1493
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:38,960
A city, according to this vision, is essentially a model that can be constructed,

1494
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:46,060
calculated and put in place, and you can predict what will happen tomorrow, the day after

1495
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:50,060
based on that, in any city in the world.

1496
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:58,460
Now that thinking has a very, yeah, very, very strange way of imagining the city.

1497
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:05,000
Essentially if a city is or any urban space is more of a field of application, then actually

1498
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:10,460
a site of any dynamics or conflicts or contradictions, different interests in terms of what

1499
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:13,300
should be happening in that space and that society.

1500
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,300
And I'm sure that you've all come across

1501
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:19,760
many even these drawings over similar ones

1502
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,740
from from the Go was here and his friends and allies,

1503
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:26,100
who basically imagined that this is exactly what should happen

1504
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,380
in a modern city, that these models,

1505
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:31,140
not only related to transport in this case

1506
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:33,780
also to housing or generally economic development

1507
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:36,580
should be literally applied in a city.

1508
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:39,100
So the idea there wouldn't be that

1509
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:42,220
in order to for that model to be as efficient as possible,

1510
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:45,340
everything in the city, especially its medieval,

1511
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:48,900
pre-industrial remnants would have to be raised.

1512
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,660
The city would have to become a black empty slate

1513
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:55,020
on which this model could be applied.

1514
01:39:55,020 --> 01:40:02,620
So even though this maybe wasn't its most extreme

1515
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:06,860
in the 1950s and the 1960s,

1516
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:09,700
when these urban motorways were being constructed

1517
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:13,460
when, as I showed you, urban trunks and Brussels were being put

1518
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:17,180
underground and a lot of heavy construction offers,

1519
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:19,380
destruction had to be done.

1520
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,260
This thinking is still very much applies.

1521
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:25,420
This, if you tune into engineers from construction offices

1522
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:29,980
in Brussels or elsewhere in Belgium or Northern Europe,

1523
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:35,940
the idea is that planning still has to follow some rational rules

1524
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:37,940
of solving congestion.

1525
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:40,500
in Brussels, for example, we have a Belgium-a-log stand

1526
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,000
and debate about what to do with the Ringo

1527
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,860
Brussels, the Ringo, who has to be expanded or not.

1528
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:46,820
Every single time there is an engineer talking

1529
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:50,100
on the radio and the news, what their solution would be

1530
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:51,540
is to answer to the infrastructure,

1531
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,540
because basically if you have traffic jams

1532
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:56,940
that generates lost time, that's the tremendous economy.

1533
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:58,340
You have to expand an infrastructure

1534
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:01,740
in order for the flows to be more fluid and unobstructed.

1535
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:07,260
This modern new classical thinking also,

1536
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:11,100
Well, you're thinking about fluidity of flows

1537
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:14,180
and removing barriers to these led

1538
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:16,220
to a separation of different modes of transport.

1539
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:21,220
So this is why we would have overpasses,

1540
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:23,740
food bridges that would allow

1541
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:27,180
or well separate pedestrians from cars, for example.

1542
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:32,180
So allow the cars to have a smooth space infrastructure

1543
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:35,340
for movement while pedestrians would have to

1544
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:39,200
across it over an ordinary.

1545
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:44,380
And that of course also that line of thought

1546
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,580
would be very much related or very much inspired

1547
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:49,500
also by the development of individual mobility

1548
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,980
via the car, right?

1549
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:54,780
So the car being not only this extremely free mode

1550
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,980
of transport also very rational and very fast

1551
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:58,100
while you're moving around.

1552
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:03,580
Now, we arrived to the 1970s, let's say,

1553
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:06,460
and something very important happened around that time

1554
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:09,180
Would anybody have an idea of being in the pictures?

1555
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:12,380
What, what I have in mind?

1556
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:16,260
Not change the way that we look at the car,

1557
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:19,460
the change the way we look at the transport.

1558
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:20,460
- Your prices?

1559
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:23,100
- The oil prices, I guess somebody already mentioned

1560
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,820
that in one of the classes.

1561
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:27,820
So the oil trucks in the 1970s,

1562
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,860
when first in the 1973,

1563
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:34,100
the organization of our petroleum exporting countries.

1564
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:38,000
So essentially the Persian Gulf countries in the United

1565
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,260
in Nolimbago and the 1979 Iranian revolution took place.

1566
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:45,180
That's not something that you can easily model.

1567
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,540
That's geopolitics for you.

1568
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,020
And what basically happened is that the global oil prices

1569
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:53,340
went through the roof, not maybe for a moment, for a longer time.

1570
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:56,860
And then they went down a little bit to a level

1571
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:59,500
that allowed, of course, for car-based mobility

1572
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:05,020
to continue, but what basically happened was that on a global

1573
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:09,980
scale decision makers, people who were in charge of designing

1574
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:13,740
transport infrastructure, realized that this limitless mobility

1575
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:18,980
by car has its economic cost, so all that fossil fuels might

1576
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:22,460
not be as available as they used to be.

1577
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:26,460
But also around that time began to begin some kind of,

1578
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:30,820
as moved to this slide already,

1579
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:35,660
reflection on different externalities

1580
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:38,220
are different also social and environmental costs

1581
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:41,500
that are related to carvests mobility.

1582
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:44,020
This environmental cost being, for example,

1583
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:48,140
predominantly noise, of course, accidents,

1584
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:51,940
health related issues, mostly related to pollution

1585
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:55,140
that is created by an individual cast.

1586
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:59,900
And at a run at that time,

1587
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,780
I mean, maybe it's also difficult for us to imagine,

1588
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:06,780
but until the 1970s, the idea that a car has to be efficient

1589
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,540
in terms of its fuel consumption,

1590
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:12,220
not has to be safe in terms of making sure that if it hits,

1591
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:14,860
other vehicles or if it hits pedestrians or cyclists

1592
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:17,820
it has to be more or less safe

1593
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:20,780
and there are these different areas of the car

1594
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:24,140
that absorb the energy of the impact.

1595
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:27,540
That was all essentially not the day

1596
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:29,260
with some exceptions.

1597
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:32,660
A car was the cars were not efficient

1598
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,980
from the economic perspective,

1599
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:36,860
from the environment of the perspective either.

1600
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:42,300
What changed is that, well,

1601
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:44,220
I'm again moving very fast

1602
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:46,900
in these developments.

1603
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:50,340
What changed is that there was first a reflection

1604
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:53,060
on the environmental impact of the car itself.

1605
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:56,340
And the general reflection on the questions

1606
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:58,100
to sustainable development of development

1607
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:02,460
that allows future generations to benefit

1608
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:04,620
from the same resources from the same opportunities

1609
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:07,660
that we are benefiting from today.

1610
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:10,940
So some kind of beginning of a reflection

1611
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:14,260
in terms of the planetary limits of the growth

1612
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:16,060
that our societies are,

1613
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,260
of the societies at the time where we're engaging in.

1614
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:25,140
And also an idea that cities are absolutely crucial

1615
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:28,980
for that in that process that in order

1616
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:32,340
to arrive with sustainability of the development

1617
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:36,620
of the planetary level, cities have to also be

1618
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:40,100
transformed in order to become more sustainable.

1619
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:47,140
Why is that important that we arrive to today

1620
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:49,100
to contemporary situation?

1621
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:54,100
Well, it's important, and this is, as also the title says,

1622
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:59,660
this is the, let's say, another set of also very dominant

1623
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:01,860
and very, very important,

1624
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:04,620
and I was hegemonic perspectives on transport,

1625
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:06,340
sustainable transport.

1626
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:08,860
This is because transport is recognized today.

1627
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:12,060
It's one of the most important sources of contributions

1628
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:12,900
to pollution here.

1629
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:17,620
We see that it's at least 14% of CO2 emissions

1630
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:21,260
on the global scale as the direct emissions.

1631
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:25,340
And also, while the graph, I would say that it's a little bit

1632
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:28,700
controversial because you also could add much more in terms of the

1633
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:32,620
different other related cost of construction and the way

1634
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:36,420
that housing is constructed as a function of availability of

1635
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:39,980
transport. But let's say we stick to the 40% of global emissions

1636
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:43,580
being related directly to transport, which makes transport one of

1637
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:46,820
Well, here I'm a little bit wrong.

1638
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:48,780
That is the largest single source of global transport

1639
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:52,620
emissions because you immediately see that industry is at 21%.

1640
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:55,260
We also boiled to different sectors and all that.

1641
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:57,060
But what's very important with transport

1642
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,460
is that this definitely one of the fastest,

1643
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:03,580
it's not the fastest rising contributor to emissions.

1644
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:05,820
So every year increases the highest among all

1645
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:07,460
the economic sectors globally.

1646
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:10,660
So global climate problems are essentially

1647
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:12,900
increasingly transport problems.

1648
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:16,580
This is, let's say, we may not point of departure,

1649
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:18,980
but one of the main reflections of this perspective

1650
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:20,020
on the issue.

1651
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:23,500
What also is very important is that,

1652
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,060
as you see on the left hand side,

1653
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:29,260
the global proportion of people living in urban communities

1654
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:30,180
is rising.

1655
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:35,180
So if in 2010, we were already after this magic

1656
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:39,020
threshold of 50% or more of people living in cities

1657
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:40,900
as opposed to the countryside.

1658
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:48,900
In 2030, the projection is that it will be 60% of people living in cities and that will go up to at least 67 in 2050.

1659
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:54,900
Of course, this is a mantra that I'm sure that at least those of you who follow the master in urban studies have already heard before.

1660
01:47:54,900 --> 01:48:03,900
We are living in urban society that's, you know, our planet is essentially an urban, an urban planet, planetary urbanization.

1661
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:07,900
There's a lot of concepts flying around.

1662
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:14,540
But it's important and it is a fact that increasingly the global population becoming more

1663
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:19,140
and more urban, it's in the cities that a lot of these problems will have to be addressed.

1664
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:23,340
So the urban mobility is not only that transport is crucial for solving the climate

1665
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:28,540
crisis, but it's the urban transport that constitutes definitely a very important challenge

1666
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:30,540
that has to be addressed.

1667
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:36,940
So we see that as the right-hand side-craft, that urban mobility, the Manfob, and mobility

1668
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:42,540
is rising almost exponentially. And that's expressed in trillions of kilometres per year here,

1669
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:54,860
it rose from 2010 to 2030 by 68%. Now we might think that with all the reflection on externalities

1670
01:48:54,860 --> 01:49:01,180
that cars have, and produce the environmental and social aspects that are very detrimental to

1671
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:09,580
to our lives, that we are moving away from the car. This is a perspective that we already had a short

1672
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:14,300
charge on that. There is a shift. We start to look at urban spaces a little bit differently. We

1673
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:20,540
want less cars to be present in it. But in fact on a global scale, if you look at the on the left

1674
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:28,380
hand side as a cumulative figure, so the global number of all registered cars, the rise is ongoing

1675
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:36,620
and it's huge. And that's also seen in the graph on the right hand side where we see

1676
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:43,660
non-commulative yearly amount of cars being sold on a global scale. So we see that every year

1677
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:49,500
the amount of cars being sold is rising 2019 being some sort of an exception. We have a little

1678
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:56,060
bit of a drop. But what the graph doesn't not show is the amount of SUV, so the sports utility

1679
01:49:56,060 --> 01:50:01,260
vehicles they are called, which went through the roof in 2018 and 2019.

1680
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:05,900
Their contribution environment is speaking much higher, a few times higher than regular

1681
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:07,060
vehicles.

1682
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:12,860
What also you can see over there is that in orange, if you see that the contribution, which

1683
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:17,820
can call it this way of the European Union countries in terms of the number of cars sold,

1684
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,060
is more or less stable.

1685
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:22,500
So here we don't see an important price.

1686
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:30,180
If you look at India in grey and in China in blue, here the difference between 2005 and

1687
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:32,780
2019 is significant.

1688
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:38,340
So there is a lot of economies, some call them developing economies, I'm not really a fan

1689
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:44,620
of the word, but a lot of nation states, a lot of societies where the levels of motorizations

1690
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:51,380
were relatively low and this commodity is definitely becoming more and more available.

1691
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:56,420
It's not exactly the same process that was happening in Northern Europe or North America,

1692
01:50:56,420 --> 01:51:02,940
or Western Europe or North America in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, but it's definitely a

1693
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:08,100
steep rise of modernization, of mobility levels, which raises a lot of environmental

1694
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:15,060
questions, but also ethical issues in terms of whether this is something that we now

1695
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:20,460
with our Western Northern ISA, looking at very critically, in fact, it's something that

1696
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:23,500
these people, these societies have the right to engage in it.

1697
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,300
As we did, it was our parents,

1698
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:28,780
our grandparents did some decades ago.

1699
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:31,180
But what is very important here,

1700
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:32,540
I'm going to skip this one slide,

1701
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:37,740
is that this debate, if we can put it this way, shifts its attention.

1702
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:41,180
So we're moving away from the problem of congestion,

1703
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:45,340
the problem of unobstructed flows,

1704
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:49,100
the problem of rationality, the problem of economic development.

1705
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:55,340
We see that this economic development has its environmental

1706
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:57,500
price, if we can put it this way.

1707
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:02,100
And a very important and very pertinent symbol of that mobility

1708
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,580
and transport is the car.

1709
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:09,980
As the important contributor to that cake, in terms

1710
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:16,100
of pollution, in terms of externalities of transport.

1711
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:21,300
And next time, so we still have a bit time for questions, maybe discussion,

1712
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:27,300
we're going to talk about specific examples of how transport develops along this line of thought.

1713
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:33,860
But, and I think it will be, well, it's definitely not the only thing we're going to do,

1714
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:40,820
because as I will also explain in a week, that perspective also is extremely limited in its lack of

1715
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:44,660
and social and also spatial understanding of the city.

1716
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:47,820
So a simple critique of the car as the problem

1717
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:51,380
is also leading us into a number of traps,

1718
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:56,380
which mean that our understanding of how people enjoy

1719
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:59,900
or do not enjoy mobility because of the class,

1720
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:02,700
the gender, the ethnicity, and many other factors

1721
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:04,780
is extremely limited.

1722
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:08,580
So I put a little bit of a car here.

1723
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:11,860
I wonder if you have any questions,

1724
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:14,340
any points of discussion.

1725
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:15,980
We still have 12 minutes,

1726
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,780
so we might as well use them.

1727
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:29,100
- I might try to initiate a little discussion here

1728
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:33,540
about popularity of cars and

1729
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:38,140
endless mess that we are now seeing

1730
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:43,140
of a lifestyle on high speed and etc.

1731
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:51,380
I observed a curious thing that on TV in Belgium,

1732
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:53,340
at least, I don't usually watch TV,

1733
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:58,340
but I happened to watch 41 night with my friend

1734
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:04,580
like a generic Belgium program.

1735
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:09,820
during the advertisement period, all the odds,

1736
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:14,300
a vast majority of them were about cars.

1737
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:19,300
And in all ways, they were trying to sell either lifestyle,

1738
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:26,500
a ecological idea that new cars can be in the green,

1739
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:33,020
et cetera, but I was wondering if we might ever arrive

1740
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:41,260
to this thinking that we should not be advertising this anymore,

1741
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:50,380
as we don't advertise cigarettes or alcohol on TV and media,

1742
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:54,780
in whether that makes sense or doesn't.

1743
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:57,940
It's an interesting thought.

1744
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,980
We will actually come back to it next time,

1745
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:02,780
but they wonder if somebody has already, you know,

1746
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:07,180
an opinion on this, should advertising cars

1747
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:09,860
or sale cars should be banned because it's

1748
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:11,300
but for society.

1749
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:22,860
And we're going to give an ad to this

1750
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:27,300
that I've been watching Belgian TV for a long time

1751
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:28,660
as I'm saying, Belgian.

1752
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:33,940
And there always used to be park commercials,

1753
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:38,100
but in the last two years, actually most of them

1754
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:45,580
have been for SUV cars, or like there's been a bit shift

1755
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:49,780
to making commercials for SUV cars, which I

1756
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:51,620
have found really strange.

1757
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:59,940
- Well, yeah, I think it's happening.

1758
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:01,380
I was considering to put another graph

1759
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:03,820
that shows the increase of SUV sales in the really,

1760
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:06,380
maybe before 2015, it was,

1761
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:07,940
this market hardly existed.

1762
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:11,820
It really became a thing in the last two years,

1763
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:14,260
at least in Western Europe.

1764
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:15,820
I think it was a little bit different

1765
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:18,660
in Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine,

1766
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:24,420
some cultural reasons also really bad roads

1767
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:26,180
and a lot of rich people.

1768
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:32,420
But, okay, but that seems that if you tune in

1769
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:34,700
to the mainstream culture, if you show TV

1770
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:37,340
and advertising in between programs,

1771
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:38,940
the cars are still very much there.

1772
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:42,340
Well, maybe not regular cars, but more SUVs, as you say.

1773
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:47,820
I think it's an interesting observation.

1774
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:51,340
Anybody else has some thoughts on this or another things?

1775
01:56:51,340 --> 01:57:06,140
I think it would be quite hard to prohibit the advertisements if there's no real alternative

1776
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:13,380
for the car, for example, in flanders, yeah, there's an extreme suburbanization and its

1777
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:24,100
mobility is not that good to get to different places such as work or leisure. So yeah, I think first

1778
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:30,340
a better alternative for the car needs to be installed. And what is that alternative?

1779
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:42,340
Yeah, maybe better public transport, safer also in cities, but also in just down safer bicycle

1780
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:44,820
lanes or, yeah.

1781
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:51,260
And yes, like car sharing more,

1782
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:53,700
if not really an alternative for cars,

1783
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:58,460
it may be less having each household having two cars

1784
01:57:58,460 --> 01:57:59,460
or three.

1785
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:02,540
And in Belgium, there's also the big problem

1786
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:07,540
of the companies having giving cars to their employees,

1787
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:12,780
which has sparked the bait.

1788
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:16,180
- Yes, in Belgium in fact,

1789
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:18,500
most of new cars being sold,

1790
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:20,140
a so-called company cars, which are

1791
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:22,660
paid for by the,

1792
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:23,900
I mean, for those who do not know

1793
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:25,140
who are not from Belgium,

1794
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:28,580
it's a system that allows you to get a free car

1795
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:29,900
from your employer,

1796
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:33,020
and it's basically a way of giving somebody a salary bump

1797
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:37,420
because a tax free bonus,

1798
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:39,180
if you increase somebody's salary,

1799
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:46,860
would have to pay tax on this. You don't pay tax on the company car. But then why do you think

1800
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:53,980
people, well, because it seems that I described some kind of a shift of thinking and some

1801
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:58,300
reflection on these environmental problems that the corporate uses and all the new

1802
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:03,260
senses that it causes, but it seems that people still drive. Why do you think they still do it?

1803
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:07,660
Why is it still so popular?

1804
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:14,220
Maybe I can refer to this. I think there's like

1805
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:19,260
exactly what you were talking about before like certain

1806
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:23,260
yeah certain

1807
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:27,420
factors which which cannot be

1808
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:38,060
somehow persist before like like our planners cannot um sorry um like you

1809
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:42,300
certain things you cannot plan and like it's an individual approach that

1810
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:47,340
the symbol of the car is still like deep in the mind of a lot of people that they

1811
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:55,740
it's like a day routine that you get into your car and drive to the to your

1812
01:59:55,740 --> 02:00:03,180
working place. And I think that's exactly the problem that it's certain changes in the transportation

1813
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:10,940
system cannot be made by planners or transport transportation planners, but have to be made in

1814
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:19,660
in the society or in the symbolism of a car. So it's a mindset, it's some cultural

1815
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:28,540
How do we choose sociologists would say that's a way of imagining how we interact with the world or how we move through it?

1816
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:35,540
But I think the example of the company power also shows it something else. It's not exclusive. That is also a policy.

1817
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:39,540
That there are a number of political instruments that make it.

1818
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:48,540
I mean, if we go with that simplified logic of making a rational economic choice,

1819
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:51,180
How do I go and what do I go?

1820
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:55,100
It simply makes this decision more simple, more rational.

1821
02:00:55,100 --> 02:01:01,180
It makes sense to have a car from an economic perspective as well, in many cities still.

1822
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:12,460
If I could maybe add to that also that's structurally, there is a lot of government as well,

1823
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:18,300
policy support not just like the company cars, but as we saw these days with the crisis,

1824
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:24,940
I think to try to boost, not to allow our automobile manufacturing, automobile companies,

1825
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:29,660
crumble because of the employment opportunities that they provide. So,

1826
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:35,580
strangely enough, actually some of the financial loss or some of the new

1827
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:42,540
funds for the stimulate the economy have been directly towards individual car owners

1828
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:49,100
purchase of different people. So I think when you when you see that it's

1829
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:55,100
being imperative a big push if you can have access to that as well.

1830
02:01:55,100 --> 02:02:00,460
Yeah. I think singles with aviation, I don't know if you follow the London news, but

1831
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:05,500
one of the first, maybe not first, but one of the only discussions in terms of some economic

1832
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:11,660
package for stimulating the economy in Belgium was towards the aviation companies.

1833
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:17,020
The argument being is that these industries create jobs and these jobs are valuable.

1834
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:21,740
Well, I'm not saying whether this is right or wrong,

1835
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:27,900
but the argument is there that these modes of mobility also produce employment.

1836
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:33,100
I think that relates a little bit to this aspect of economic development, this anticipation,

1837
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:39,980
that this way of moving around our cities or societies in general is very important for the economy

1838
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:43,020
to keep growing, to keep persisting.

1839
02:02:43,020 --> 02:02:49,260
Are there any other comments? We're from some people who haven't spoken yet.

1840
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:51,580
Do you have some thoughts?

1841
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:53,500
Some comments?

1842
02:02:53,500 --> 02:03:00,300
I was also thinking about security. The use of the car is still

1843
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:08,460
Like, yeah, done by many because maybe it's the most secure way of moving around in some cities.

1844
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:14,380
And also, like, as I'm thinking, like, as a woman, as a girl, like, moving around the city at night,

1845
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:19,500
usually like, I mean, not here in Brussels because I don't have a car here in Brussels, like, back home.

1846
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:28,700
I would go by car at night. Just because like, yeah, it's not very secure to move around with,

1847
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:34,300
like probably transport or even by bike. So I would say like yeah it's a matter of security as well.

1848
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:43,260
And it's more like a structure problem to change so I guess more steps have to be taken in that sense.

1849
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:51,660
Yeah it's a very good point. It's existed before the pandemic and now it's become even more

1850
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:59,020
more of an issue. So any data shows us that, especially the upper middle class or upper class

1851
02:03:59,020 --> 02:04:06,060
people have bought themselves a new car to separate themselves from the danger of interacting with

1852
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:11,820
others. And this danger would be related to maybe criminality or general lack of safety, especially

1853
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:17,820
at night, especially for women perhaps. But now this sense of danger and the car is this kind of

1854
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:24,540
bubble that allows you to separate yourself from whatever danger society holds, it's even stronger.

1855
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:34,060
I think what's important also, we will talk about this a lot next time, is that this goes

1856
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:40,140
very differently for different people. I mean it sounds very obvious, but whether you look at

1857
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:44,140
the situation from a class perspective or from a gender perspective or from a racial perspective,

1858
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:49,660
I think all these three also ages very important. All these four then

1859
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:55,580
the blind person is very much. The way that people arrive through a decision in terms of

1860
02:04:55,580 --> 02:05:00,940
why they go where they go and how they go, it's very different from cluster class from

1861
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:08,460
gendered gender etc etc. So this homo-economic paradigm is extremely problematic there.

1862
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:17,100
But so is, I hope I will convince you of that, this direct critique of the car,

1863
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:23,340
because different people use the car for different reasons. And not always, it's an individual choice,

1864
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:30,540
but also there are some structural issues that play, also indeed, some cultural inertia,

1865
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:38,780
some ways of being that were installed and promoted for decades, which now we are of some of us.

1866
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:46,140
living in city centres, critical of things are quite different if you're from a

1867
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:51,460
different class and living in different areas of the city. I don't mind taking one

1868
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:55,500
more or two more questions but it's age already so we are very free to leave

1869
02:05:55,500 --> 02:06:00,180
if you want to. I don't want to take too much of your time.

1870
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:05,540
Well, great.

1871
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:09,540
I'm glad this is working from the technical perspective at least.

1872
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:13,540
Yeah, I will see you next week.

1873
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:16,540
Can I add a last question?

1874
02:06:16,540 --> 02:06:17,540
Yeah, yeah.

1875
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:21,540
The last question about the excursion that we have program.

1876
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:25,540
I know that in COVID times, well, it's not happening.

1877
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:28,540
No, no, I was told that, yeah,

1878
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:33,180
was trying to do it, but it's not possible, unfortunately.

1879
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:34,740
I wish we could do it.

1880
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:37,620
The idea is for those of you who are in Brussels next semester,

1881
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:39,380
but all of you will be, right?

1882
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:49,620
Well, I mean, let's say, well, we don't know, of course,

1883
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:50,460
what happens in a few months.

1884
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:54,300
But the idea is that if in spring, we are more or less

1885
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:57,060
to more into face-to-face meetings,

1886
02:06:57,060 --> 02:07:02,340
we do the excursion then. We imagined with David Bas another is what would happen if we meet with

1887
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:07,620
40 people and tried to keep distance. I think this would you know we would hit YouTube very quickly

1888
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:14,660
I think trying to walk through the city in this arrangement. So no and also in December I mean it

1889
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:20,180
would be very strange. From ice greens in the end we would definitely try to keep together

1890
02:07:20,180 --> 02:07:26,820
just to keep warm. It's cold right? So we will do that in spring I hope. It's a nice excursion.

1891
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:33,060
from what I've heard. People usually enjoy it. Even though it's only about transport.

1892
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:41,300
But yeah, I'm sorry about that. I wish we could do it. Yeah, this is the reality we're living in.

1893
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:49,380
I hope you've got a great rest of the week. I'll see you all next week. The links are there,

1894
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:53,220
So it seems that everything is clear and working. So that's brilliant.

1895
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:58,260
Enjoy and have a good, have a good week.

1896
02:07:58,260 --> 02:08:00,740
Thank you for the lecture.

1897
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:04,100
Thank you very much. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.

1898
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:06,620
