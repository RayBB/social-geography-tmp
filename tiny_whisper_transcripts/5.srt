1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have done my best now to restart the stream.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Maybe you can ask whether it is working.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It is difficult for me to check.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I thought I had been doing what I have been doing last week.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It seemed to work then.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But I am also for those who use the streams to study.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,440
I think it makes more sense to use last year's stream,

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,760
also for today's lecture,

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,320
for those who are following now,

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,920
because I prefer to teach for the ones here,

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,120
meaning that I will be from my screen.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,880
She'll also put that on again.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,600
Or in the classroom, and that will not be recorded.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,800
And last year, I've just been streaming from my office

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,440
because we were not supposed to have lectures anymore.

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,760
So I feel that it's better to draw in lost the SZ and also for the ones who come and be

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:13,040
here today. But also in case you want to study the slides are 99% safe. So I think it makes

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,520
most sense to use lost years of live streets also for last weeks.

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Do you have any information about this tree now?

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
I think it's working.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Okay, I'll do my best to move it in that direction.

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
Okay, so let's suppose that the tree is working.

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,560
If not, everyone can rely on last year's theme.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Okay, I think quite many of you are here.

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,320
I don't know how many students I'm expected to have.

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,760
I think 70 or 80% is here.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,120
Good, the ideal of social mix.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,000
And so I thought you already,

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,040
I told you already that in many cities across the world,

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,520
there has been a concern with segregation.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
And then we're supposed,

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,360
that segregation has negative effects on poor people.

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,160
So, add that you're worse off when you're poor,

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,360
when you're living in a neighborhood where

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,760
with a concentration of poverty, rather than in a mixed neighborhood,

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,360
where you have both working class people and a good class.

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,560
Already in the 19th century,

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,720
the heydays of the industrial revolution. You have very different groups

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,480
the capitalistic bourgeoisie and the Ethiopian socialists and so both the bourgeoisie

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:03,360
and the socialists who are afraid or who are thinking that concentrations of laborers

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,200
in particular neighborhoods of the city, for example here in Brussels in Bolognese at that time,

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,160
and for it and to work in an unfair report and put it out,

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,080
that this would have negative effects.

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,040
And the bourgeoisie was afraid that concentrations

45
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,920
of laborers might lead to revolutions,

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,880
that socialist thinking would become dominant

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,000
in these neighborhoods, and that you would never

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,200
recall that people would get upstream.

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,040
And the utopian socialists, they were scared

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,280
that these concentrations of lasers would make it more

51
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,320
difficult to strive for an egalitarian society.

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,200
And so on both ends of the political spectrum,

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,000
you had people who were thinking that it

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,440
places such as Manchester or Gental Brussels,

55
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,440
where you had these new working laws, neighborhoods,

56
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,000
that this was something that to be contracted.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,920
This ideal is still very dominant nowadays.

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,840
Here you see a quote from

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,520
the Russell Scapfoe region,

60
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,720
by the old one working,

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,160
current policy of the country,

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,880
which I'm similar quotes,

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,120
stating that contrary to the American city,

64
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,000
the ideal type for the European city

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,600
is based on the mix of functions and,

66
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,280
and I think it's important to make a distinction

67
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,560
between these two things on the one hand they refer to a functional mix, meaning that

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,120
they would like to strive for neighborhoods where you have a mix of the residential function

69
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,280
of artisans and houses.

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:01,360
And for example, offices or shops, saying that well, it's not good to have neighborhoods

71
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,120
they only have a residential fridge.

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,040
And other neighborhoods where your only have offices.

73
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,240
And so we strive for a Brussels with neighborhoods

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,120
where you have a functional mix.

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,520
And the other thing, this is what we are interested in.

76
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,440
A is saying, well, we also want Brussels

77
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,080
by other European citizens who have neighborhoods

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,560
with a mix of people, poor people and rich people.

79
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,960
And in Brussels, there have been many different moments

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,800
where this topic of social mixed

81
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,600
has been on the political agenda.

82
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,920
I think there is a few,

83
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,040
but not surprised to Brussels only a month ago.

84
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,320
I might have heard of these discussions around

85
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,340
paper, was social housing estate,

86
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Unmanlyed.

87
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,600
Sorry, the periphery of the Brussels capital region.

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,080
And therefore, you have quite some media reports about crime.

89
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,800
And then the issue of, well, you have all these

90
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,320
to be accommodated on the social housing estate

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,680
in Brussels and in Belgium,

92
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,360
more generally you need to fall below certain income

93
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,520
And meaning that it's mainly the poorest of the poor that do concentrate on the social housing

94
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
instance.

95
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,440
And so then you have discussions, well, is that the good thing?

96
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:44,920
Is this not leading to this culture where crime or con- and conservative politicians would

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,760
erase these kinds of those sorts?

98
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,700
Progressive politicians would wonder, well, is that then a neighborhood where they're

99
00:06:52,700 --> 00:07:00,060
it is easy for people to climb the social building. Wouldn't it be easier to be socially mobile

100
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,620
when you are not only surrounded by other poor people, but when you are living between

101
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:15,580
and poor and rich people are like it. So beta-bles, a neighborhood in on the left,

102
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:24,460
And obviously also in the way of these terrorist attacks in 2015, there were a lot of concerns

103
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:31,900
also in the international youth, about knowledge and their reports about knowledge,

104
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,500
as they were doing as a get-up. I've been looking at the statistics. I think

105
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,860
of all the makers of the most people of Moroccan origin,

106
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,380
the most followers of Islam, but it's still less than half.

107
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,780
So in the international media, it was often

108
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,340
reported as if Mollum May was immunistic, but with only

109
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:06,060
Moroccan people and people of Moroccan origins.

110
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,660
And then you look at this example, it's not the case.

111
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,260
Nonetheless, there were some concerns,

112
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,180
hopefully, that also could be a penalty.

113
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,940
About Mollumbe being a safe haven,

114
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,100
for there is a breeding ground for their central tech

115
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,100
that you have this concentration of people

116
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:36,780
of the same origin was then the reason to be, to be concerned.

117
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,180
So both when it comes to social mobility

118
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:46,180
and when it comes to cultural integration, new commerce,

119
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,580
there are concerns, ethnicity, such as Brussels,

120
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,660
about the concentration of either two people

121
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,380
or people of foreign origin.

122
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,980
These are two different issues, social mobility

123
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,300
and social control in the future.

124
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
As I said, was there a question?

125
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,300
- So, the structure of five people?

126
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,300
- No, I am trying to explain you.

127
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,300
I'm not saying that there is a desire to plan

128
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
or supply in the social mix,

129
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
but I'm trying to explain you that in many cities

130
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,300
across the world, I will start from a couple of intelligent examples.

131
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,300
This idea of social mix is high on the whole of the knowledge.

132
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,300
memory, very to this data, most issue, and more on the

133
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,300
app to the errors, the text as to moments, where social mix

134
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,300
was highly debated. Local media in case of this

135
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,300
terrorist, the text also is informational.

136
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Um, Brussels, we move to Gint,

137
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
an informer colleague of mine,

138
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,300
that's written a nice book about gentrification

139
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,860
in the nation, in this name is a spot called Tukkau,

140
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,180
so for those who know the church and for our interests

141
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,180
that they find some interest in the literature.

142
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,100
And see a quote from an elder man of the city of Kent

143
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,380
talking about a production of Kent neighborhoods

144
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,540
such as wish support,

145
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,820
neighborhoods that have a similar history

146
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:30,220
a small make in Brussels or in Al-Terepa North in Antwerp.

147
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,240
Neighborhoods that have developed in this 19th century

148
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,860
industrial industrialization.

149
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,860
And so neighborhoods with a higher than average

150
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,580
percentage of unemployment, higher than average percentage

151
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,220
of people, also a higher than average percentage

152
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,940
of people or for an average, etc.

153
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,900
What was this elder man saying?

154
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,420
Well, when I attract young families,

155
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,300
preferably with a job, preferably double income families

156
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,580
that will improve my social tissue, my sex base,

157
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,180
and my neighborhood life.

158
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,540
I think these are different health

159
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,540
serves the dead space, something important, I'm sorry.

160
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,020
In Belgium, about 40 to 50% of the municipal budget

161
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,420
comes from local taxes.

162
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,300
Most of it is a percentage on the local income tax

163
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,220
and percentage on the income tax,

164
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,420
meaning that if you have more rich people

165
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,140
in your municipality, that you will have

166
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,500
a higher municipal budget.

167
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Yeah. The other part comes from Lent and I'll study you.

168
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,700
So why did this other amount of Ghent finally

169
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,900
for the trends? Young families prefer to leave a joke.

170
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,900
They look lost from the white families.

171
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,900
They still improve these local text things.

172
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,100
So you have more budgets for the city of Ghent.

173
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,700
But on top of that,

174
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:19,340
It's also important to improve my social tissue, and I will go further intuitive, but often

175
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:26,820
there the underlying thought is that, for example, when you have rich and poor people,

176
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,060
when you have families, really good job and families without the job that you will get

177
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:38,420
diverse social networks, for example, and that in these networks, jobs can be found for

178
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,780
people can be held with homework, etc.

179
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:48,020
So this ID for the importance to attract young families,

180
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,580
we call it refurbishment.

181
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,140
It's not only for to improve text-based obesity,

182
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,480
but also to improve the social tissue and the labor

183
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,460
of life.

184
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:07,060
In very much a similar way, we move to the city of Annenberg,

185
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,700
And we have been visiting this unperturbed port,

186
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,580
the neighborhood, the neighborhood,

187
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,680
where I think 25% of the new covers in Enter

188
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,460
passed through before moving to other parts of the city

189
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,140
and neighborhood that is quite similar to this transition.

190
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,580
So the burgers was describing in my own sanctuary style.

191
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,100
And I've been talking there about a lot of regulations

192
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,460
that affected shopkeepers in the neighborhood,

193
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:43,460
but also regulations that concern the subdivision of houses.

194
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:49,460
And you see there that in the previous government agreement in

195
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,460
Enter, it was stated that the city wants a larger share of single-family

196
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:02,460
developments in this particular neighborhood in the housing supply in order to attract families.

197
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,460
I always find it interesting to see this kind of word.

198
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,460
Often the youngster means young people of foreign backgrounds.

199
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,460
What you see here is that families excuse me,

200
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,460
what is land is funnel-in-mail families,

201
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
all of them are white countries.

202
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,460
So that is why the transformation of single-family

203
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,460
develops into smaller housing entities is not desired.

204
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
And for those who joined the mentor,

205
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,900
We have been discussing how could you support the arrival function in this neighborhood?

206
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,660
Well, then people are looking for a very cheap place to live and they will rent a room

207
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
for even just a mattress.

208
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,660
And that's what they would for the cheapest roof above their heads.

209
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,860
What you see here is that the city of Hanford is not so poor, the arrival of the church.

210
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:01,300
defines it in importance to bring another kind of people to this neighborhood, namely richer

211
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:12,180
levels. So again, you see efforts here to turn this out to an open north into the social

212
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:22,180
the mixed neighborhood where you have newcomers next to white families who can afford to buy

213
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:32,260
such a big house just for the use of one family. In the art in the art, people by

214
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,260
I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

215
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,260
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

216
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,260
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

217
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,260
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

218
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,260
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

219
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,260
and I've been here a lot of times, and I've been here a lot of times,

220
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:06,260
of foreign origin, you had demolition projects and you had the creation of new dwellings

221
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:14,260
that try to cater for different audiences. And again, you see the, this is a course

222
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:22,780
from the Army Department of State, you see that the idea was that in these neighborhoods

223
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:29,020
that can be transformed, that these big inhabitants,

224
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,180
the people who used to live there,

225
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,540
were seriously disadvantaged by a rare name.

226
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,560
And the idea was that living in such a neighborhood

227
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,940
being poor in such a neighborhood,

228
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,500
accessor-based poverty makes it worse,

229
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,660
not basically living in such a neighborhood

230
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,780
is worse than living in another name.

231
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:58,820
that is only more difficult to find out a poverty in such a neighborhood of the parts of this.

232
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:07,380
So for this reason, it was a big, big and project to basically the knowledge match of the house

233
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,380
in these neighborhoods and to build new houses that cater for different audiences.

234
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,900
Slater also refers to this whole sixth program in the UK and the US sorry.

235
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:31,620
For example, Capri Nichri, a neighborhood of miles to the north of Peru in Chicago.

236
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,420
Lastly, there have been quite a bit of a Chicago.

237
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:42,420
A neighborhood with a very bad reputation for drug use and any crime and any other things.

238
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:51,780
And again what has been done there is that many of these apartment blocks that have been torn down have been demolished.

239
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:58,980
And that you houses have been built again trying to cater for other kind of hope.

240
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,700
It's trying to bring the millic loss to a neighborhood that was previously painted in evident fire.

241
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,820
And then in the situation of the SU-minded hurdle, this far geosystem,

242
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,060
where many of the original residents of the neighborhood such as that,

243
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:24,660
other voucher, and basically to give them discount on their rent price,

244
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,780
in other parts of the city trying to encourage them to move and to better off

245
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,540
neighborhoods in other parts of the ocean garden.

246
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:44,420
So again you see attempts to mix neighborhoods in the conviction that the concentration of poverty

247
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:51,620
is bad that it leads to crime and it leads to drug use and that it is bad for these

248
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,380
inhabitants.

249
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,220
South Africa? Yeah? I want to know what's going on, how come about it?

250
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:09,380
It's the... Well, I think the outcome, there are many, many papers about this and many scholars

251
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:17,780
looking at different sides of this medal, but I think in the article by Stom Slater, page

252
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:26,420
369 I see here. It is stated that no effects have been reported for a number of outcomes

253
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:34,100
and that at first effects on the delinquency and physical health of

254
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:42,020
Adorsant males in particular have been reported but positive effects on adult mental health and

255
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:48,740
education and health of young women. So it depends very much what you're looking at, but in any

256
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,980
case studies who try it and to find out like what happened to the people who moved to middle

257
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:02,740
class neighborhoods, found very at first effects and in any case one good question whether such

258
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:15,700
Well, because the project was the best one to try and improve the situation of computer and Chicago.

259
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:22,900
I will discuss the effects of such programs in more detail. But before doing that, I wanted to

260
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,180
highlight that in many countries across the world, US, UK, many built-insities,

261
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,460
and basically all over the Europe in South Africa.

262
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,420
And then step in,

263
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,940
to create socially mixed neighborhoods

264
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,700
in the conviction that segregation

265
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,780
and the concentration of poverty is bad

266
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,780
for people living in just the situation.

267
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,100
- One question, okay, yeah.

268
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,940
Why is there this idea that I can't speak?

269
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,660
Like, you know, there's a target.

270
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:07,660
[ Inaudible ]

271
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
>> I don't know what to say.

272
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,660
I don't know how to make the definition of inclusion.

273
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:18,660
In any case, I think it's another coincidence that all of these projects that you see here

274
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:26,660
are about bringing the middle class to neighborhoods which used to be predominant for

275
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,260
And the future.

276
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,020
This fire-shark program that I was just talking about

277
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,220
is also doing the other way,

278
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,900
doing it the other way around because it's

279
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:40,180
nice to bring four people to a milliposs neighbor.

280
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,940
And so this is also a project where milli-class neighborhoods

281
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,780
are also becoming more or mixed.

282
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,860
Because by giving these rents subsidies

283
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,060
through this fire-shark system, it allows people

284
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,300
and the religious people to move to a better off parts

285
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,460
of the city as well.

286
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,540
But I will come back to that.

287
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,860
For now,

288
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,140
we, it's good that you already start to wondering

289
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,900
about effects of these programs.

290
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,820
But as I said for now, it's important that you see

291
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,820
that in many parts, in many corners of the world,

292
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,260
this ideal of socially mixed,

293
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:31,260
socially mixed neighborhoods seems to be a very stable kind of idea.

294
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:38,260
And it's very predominant among policy makers, both on the left and on the right.

295
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:45,260
So on both ends of the political spectrum, you find this pretty four neighborhoods

296
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:53,260
that house people with different origins or people of different social economic backgrounds.

297
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Two questions we need to ask about this is it possible then to create social index mixed neighborhoods and then a third visit or second the second question.

298
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,260
Is it desirable to do it?

299
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,240
And the article by a little stator gives, or those stators

300
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,800
gives an historical, apparently clear answer referring

301
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,280
to this whole six program in the United States

302
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,760
and housing markets review rule in the UK

303
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,520
is stating that whatever they don't,

304
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,960
they have basically just shifted over the elsewhere.

305
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,720
This has not been a remedy to overty.

306
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,000
This has just made full people elsewhere in the city.

307
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,600
The mode of production that shapes urban environment,

308
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,160
extreme net,

309
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,440
it's referring to the capitalistic system

310
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,440
there, the system of production of capitalism,

311
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,300
produce concentrations of poverty

312
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,480
that many policymakers, as we have seen,

313
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,720
rejoice in bringing up.

314
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,120
yet, at same mode of production,

315
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,120
churning in tech produces further concentrations

316
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,640
just down the street.

317
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,240
I still remember one of my former professors

318
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,720
saying that, well, many of these attempts

319
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,320
to create socially mixed neighborhoods

320
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,000
by attracting middle class people

321
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,480
to, for example, who neighbors?

322
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,880
in Brussels has just shifted this over the elsewhere. And for that reason, the

323
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:49,560
he made this comparison with moving chairs on the deck of the Titanic. People remain poor,

324
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:56,600
which you just make them move somewhere else. But this does not improve their socio-economic

325
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,840
position. This does not help them to climb the social ladder. In the day's fight, I can't

326
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,840
all you have also seen is reference to water bed.

327
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:16,840
So when you look at that, it seems to be very hard to create a social mix.

328
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,840
The same goes for Brussels.

329
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,840
I have been referring to this article by Martin,

330
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,840
like Knee King, already in Shadow 1.

331
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:35,480
And basically what material has been doing is to study people moving out of

332
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,200
gender-ifying neighborhoods in Brussels. What happens to people who move out of

333
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,400
neighborhoods in Brussels that are gender-ifying? And basically he made a distinction

334
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,420
between different clusters of people and if I'm correct, then cluster one

335
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,300
consistent mainly of highly educated German coefficients.

336
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,300
Where do they move as neighborhoods in versus gentry5?

337
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:10,420
They move to and to work and gensh and also some of the municipalities of Plava,

338
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,420
one of them.

339
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,920
And these are municipalities.

340
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,980
These people find a joke in another city, in another part of Belgium.

341
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,980
They move out of these gentry5 neighborhoods and they move to a place closer to the place

342
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,980
and that's where it is.

343
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,980
But the tool consisted of more working-wise people,

344
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,980
people with a lower-than-average income,

345
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,980
where you then move first of all to,

346
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:45,980
well, make difficulties along the canal,

347
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,980
and such as Holland and U of Warden,

348
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,600
the home of our familiar all of you are

349
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,340
to the geography of Belgium already,

350
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,940
but these are also usability small towns

351
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,660
that have gone through a process of industrialization

352
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,860
and where humans find small houses

353
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,140
that will be cheaper than the houses you would find

354
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,060
in these gentry-fly neighborhoods in Brussels.

355
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,220
And so what you see here is that gentry-ification

356
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,420
comes with displacement, for example,

357
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,220
to a municipality such as Phil Moore.

358
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:26,300
So as you see these clusters you can find rather far from Brussels,

359
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:36,940
Cenvois, Laudien, Mols, many town cities in this 19th century

360
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,580
built for industrialization in the Indian culture.

361
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,780
So these are municipalities very much find housing for a rather

362
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:53,660
cheap price. So if you follow material by thinking this argument, then you would see,

363
00:27:53,660 --> 00:28:02,620
well, what happens here is that by trying to improve the lives of poor people in Brussels,

364
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:11,100
through creating the social mix, attracting the middle class to these neighborhoods. What you see

365
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:18,100
is that these people moved, are displaced to other municipalities,

366
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:23,100
where you also have concentrations of poor people.

367
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:29,100
But they are located in much worse situations, locations,

368
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,100
where it comes to finding a drug for it.

369
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:38,100
And so what is happening here is a shifting the chairs on the deck of the Titanic

370
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,980
over these still exists, but by attracting the middle of the loss to some

371
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:49,220
neighborhoods from Brussels, you move forward the elsewhere. To places where

372
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,860
people can afford to live, and these are neighborhoods that we have been

373
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:01,420
visiting in Isha, the Walker, and Salk. We're here buying a house or renting an

374
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,380
apartment will be much cheaper than this in San

375
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,380
actually, for some of the other genshifying parts of process.

376
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,820
This map shows something very similar for Antwerp,

377
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,940
those who joined to Antwerp by a recognized

378
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,860
its first reading, the medieval Antwerp,

379
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,860
the second reading, 19th century industrial Antwerp,

380
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,620
and what is not...

381
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,220
visualizes is a synthesis index of this advantage.

382
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,700
And you see that in some neighborhoods,

383
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,100
there are no big changes in the last years

384
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,940
in this index.

385
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,700
They are yellow, for example,

386
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,620
blue fall social housing estates

387
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,460
that we have visited the remains yellow situation.

388
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,740
There does not really change.

389
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,460
You also see other parts of the city, for example,

390
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,460
A luncheon, the area around the museum that we are doing.

391
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,940
You see that this is blue.

392
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,020
And many of the inner city neighborhoods

393
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,060
in Alberta, the North, for example, are also blue.

394
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:24,060
At the same time, you see that other parts of the city,

395
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,540
for example, medicine and dirt on the outside

396
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,600
of this 19th century, well by a sea of worsening

397
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,400
of this synthesis.

398
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,000
That's also here.

399
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Through this map, you could see that, well,

400
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,400
some neighborhoods are attracting

401
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,040
four million plus people,

402
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,800
but poverty is shifted elsewhere in the city

403
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,240
is moving to other parts of the urban region.

404
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,520
This map is just giving you the situation

405
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,000
for the municipality or the city of Antwerp,

406
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,480
that if you would include the global programs

407
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,040
of the vendor, you might see that, for example,

408
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,760
all for people to know the future.

409
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,320
Or they're high in the people region.

410
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,200
They're yet to be split effectors,

411
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,040
to be protected to the boss,

412
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,720
that you would see a worsening of the issue.

413
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,320
So we can try to attract villain loss people.

414
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,960
That's when the city of the service,

415
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,960
You can try to attract the middle of the law, so it's back to the city.

416
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:35,500
But this place is people from these neighborhoods who cannot order their

417
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,960
anymore. So this is whose poverty elsewhere?

418
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Yeah.

419
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Question?

420
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,960
[inaudible]

421
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,960
Well, I must admit that I don't go all the imitators in this specific index, but I guess

422
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,960
it will be about average income, unemployment, I may be some other indicators that say

423
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,960
something about this name.

424
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,960
But I should have put this.

425
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,840
So much of what we see here confirms this ID of Slater

426
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,840
when clicking in that well, trying to create a social mix

427
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,760
in some parts of the city.

428
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:28,560
Will shift poverty will make a poverty move elsewhere.

429
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,840
I will create, that's what Slater said,

430
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,320
will create over concentrations of poverty.

431
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,120
This is just down the street in shallow go up

432
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,960
are the case of these gentry flying neighborhoods of Brussels, in bone for the gentry flying.

433
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,760
So that's where in medicine, in Berlin, in other parts of these urban regions.

434
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:02,560
There are examples in the world where mixed neighborhoods are being created.

435
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:10,640
But then it's only possible when city councils or governments can have a serious

436
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:19,240
impact upon who is living in specific neighborhoods.

437
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:28,600
In some parts of the world, scholars write about conclusion that we housing or inclusion

438
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:35,800
every zoning forcing for example real estate developers who devour a high tower

439
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:44,380
full of apartments to dedicate a certain percentage of these residents

440
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:51,160
residential units to people who fall below a certain income threshold and so

441
00:33:51,160 --> 00:34:01,880
you can create a social-emixed neighborhood. If you force real estate developers to

442
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:13,080
well in a newly built project, you have a certain percentage of apartments,

443
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,360
of four people, of the certain, in people, are fully low-surfing in countries.

444
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:26,120
In Enter, I've been talking about this Catholic's neighborhood. This was the land of the port in

445
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:36,120
public hands. And so, this is the council could also sell this land to developers with a lot of

446
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:46,440
conditions. And so, developers could buy this land under the condition that they built 25% of the

447
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,440
There is digital units for social housing, 15% rent, 10% to buy.

448
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,440
And then they reserved 50% of the units at affordable prices.

449
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,440
And that was not very affordable, but at least you could not ask whatever you wanted.

450
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
This prices could not skyrocket.

451
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,440
You could not ask whatever you wanted for these residential units.

452
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:19,040
And so you could argue, a socially mixed neighborhood has been developed here almost from

453
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,520
scratch because only it's white.

454
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,480
The looks that you see here are new and only the brown ones exist.

455
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,680
But that was possible because the land was public owned and could be sold to developers

456
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,560
under the condition that the reserve is kind of.

457
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:47,120
it's for certain degrees of people. And I make a look who is able to rent or buy these units

458
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:56,640
without in case you can follow a certain income threshold in order to be able to be eligible

459
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:07,280
for the social housing. Yes. The same goes for this affordability criteria. I don't know how

460
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,040
what was the price exactly. But I see here that you could earn up to 58,000 euro of

461
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:21,900
family, almost 4,000 euro added for each additional person. So we are buying quite high

462
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,880
incomes already. But the bottom line is that these developers could not just build whatever

463
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:34,440
they want. That they need to meet certain criteria and that they also need to serve

464
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:41,640
Why the British number of units for people belong to different income units.

465
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,920
At the lowest income, the degrees, social housing, and then the points of house to work.

466
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:56,200
So, a socially mixed neighborhood when it comes to income, when it comes to poverty and wealth,

467
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,640
could be created. But that was only possible because there was a serious intervention

468
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,440
of the Sydney Council in this.

469
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,240
In Belgium, the government or public authorities

470
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,440
are not really able to intervene that much in housing.

471
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Because it's only days of blasters, 6% of the units,

472
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,680
which are social housing.

473
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,160
In Brussels are 10% and all the risks,

474
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,320
the development sessions, minor exceptions,

475
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,400
all the rest is the market.

476
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,200
It's either people who are home, house,

477
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,280
or people who rent the house from another market.

478
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,840
But there are cities across the world

479
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,560
where you have 50% social house in that workshop

480
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,440
or under the dump is another small,

481
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,800
a high percentage of social house.

482
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,920
That also means that as a council,

483
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,600
you can be to be quite a bit in who it is where.

484
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:07,080
in the dodging days where 90% of the people need to find a house or accommodation on the market,

485
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:13,400
you will see that attempts to create a social mix quickly lead to displacement and quickly

486
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,400
lead to concentrations of poverty elsewhere.

487
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:25,640
And this is very much the dependent on how this particular house mix looks like and how much

488
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,640
because the councils can interfere in the housing.

489
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
(mumbling)

490
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:44,640
- So it's a place?

491
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,640
- There has been a time when the social housing association

492
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,640
sold out of the white, some units, that they know it is.

493
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,640
In any case, there's no research.

494
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:04,640
And these type of files are a project for the developer.

495
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,640
This question will be, I will be in the chat.

496
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,640
As long as they can still make profits, this is possible.

497
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,640
The same goes for this inclusion of housing.

498
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,640
as long as the developer is able to take profits, then this is also.

499
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:33,640
In this case, I know that the developers have to pay a lot of money to sit and get this piece of debt.

500
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:43,640
And because they were also asked to cater for these public sectors, they had to develop the parts and the streets.

501
00:39:43,640 --> 00:40:01,640
And they have to say that in the local social house, to the city quit it very much more money by selling this piece of land for the highest price to develop and to build a sparkles for the obvious people who chose to do things different.

502
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:08,640
And there are many parts of the world where we have this kind of skis.

503
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Yeah.

00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Okay.

508
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Is social mixed feasible?

509
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
The answer is yes.

510
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,640
In this feasible, it is possible to create socially mixed neighborhoods,

511
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,640
but it is very hard to do that in a situation where the market rates,

512
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,640
and because then trying to attract middle-class families

513
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,640
who are poor neighborhoods will lead to displacement of poor families

514
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
to other parts of the country.

515
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,640
In this case, that will not happen, because you reserve

516
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:10,640
25% of the neighborhood to people who fall below a certain interest zone.

517
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:17,960
And as long as these units are social housing, these 35% will remain there for this

518
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
population.

519
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:31,200
So you allow people to live in a neighborhood where 50% belongs to

520
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,780
a village loss from the upper middle of the class and 25% of these units goes to a

521
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:44,120
baby, which people can afford to spend one million here or one.

522
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Another question?

523
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,120
Yeah, I have a question.

524
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,120
For instance, it would be like,

525
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,120
social takes early in this one,

526
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,120
for instance, areas, areas of the city.

527
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,120
But then when in this view, I'm asking for an example, actually,

528
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,120
can't wear a capitol of the city.

529
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,120
For example, for keeping, I mean,

530
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,120
just from experience,

531
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
to work out, I don't know,

532
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,120
for example, usually if you are,

533
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:19,120
like very up-to-date luxury, the lane there are so affordable and so powerful.

534
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:27,120
However, this has been changed if it's given up to a track.

535
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,120
So it might be different people of different things from the system.

536
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:41,120
But then the general effect was actually that it's upper class and the capitalist developed.

537
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:48,520
It's not like actually the people who are living there beforehand and maybe I could reserve a

538
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:55,920
It's a good question. I think in this case

539
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:03,720
People who lived there were just a fish that were ready that was not so much the case yet because you only had a couple of hundreds of people

540
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,120
You develop a neighborhood for thousands of people

541
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,120
It was a neighborhood that was more true than it was.

542
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
That was not so much worse.

543
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,620
Just, I guess it was, of course, like,

544
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,120
when there's a, when there's an example of

545
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,120
gensification, people all around it,

546
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,120
and not really attempting to solve.

547
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,120
They're trying to

548
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:40,480
[INAUDIBLE]

549
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,320
Well, I guess it depends how you will argue the 100th.

550
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,520
Also, you would say that your vacation goes with displacement

551
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,960
and displacement with the essential part of the change of education.

552
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,240
In this case, there might be a displacement

553
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,480
of the people who lived in these brown houses.

554
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,600
And who lived there already before the rest of the neighborhoods,

555
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,960
before the white parts of the neighborhoods,

556
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,480
were being concerned.

557
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:16,480
But there will not be a place in these 25% units,

558
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,360
which are either rented out or sold as social house.

559
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,140
Because you will need to fall below a certain income

560
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:30,220
order to buy or rent these goods. And no matter what happens in the rest of the day's

561
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:38,940
request, the students will still remain like reserves for people following those income

562
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,860
threshold. So this is a way to make sure that these places will not happen. Even if you

563
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:53,020
buy these kind of, you will not be able to sell them, and if you rent them out, then this is

564
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,220
There's also another condition that's followed below.

565
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,940
So it's just the average.

566
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:03,140
But it's only applied to the red part here.

567
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,140
Yeah, indeed.

568
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,780
That's the current moment.

569
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,420
Everything else at this whole area has been

570
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,860
identified that has been over-renewaled in this whole area.

571
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,340
So it's only in that very small part,

572
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,780
where they were able to create a solution.

573
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,580
So this is the my area of it though.

574
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,620
Is it really achieving a solution?

575
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,620
Yeah, one important thing is to scale the scale of which we discuss things.

576
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:33,620
Now we are talking about a very small scale neighborhood of a couple of thousand people.

577
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,620
But indeed, if you discuss it at the scale of Enter,

578
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:45,620
then you will see that this whole area around this red square that we've just been talking about has been going through

579
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:51,420
and improvement of this, this advantage in mix and has been going through

580
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:58,780
at, at very strong gender education. Sorry, that's, they're completely just a

581
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,820
fairly fair film. I don't need violence. I'm sorry. But then I'm just curious

582
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:09,060
how it works here. Like, um, due to the private health, we can get tax based

583
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,780
or like, and it's from the government or the YH.

584
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,300
It's from the government because I was a member.

585
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,180
Well, I don't know about these these

586
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:20,260
thanks for your base, but for sure the length price

587
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:23,500
for which they were able to acquire this.

588
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,300
Well, the price for which they were able to buy this piece

589
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,700
of length from the city council was much lower

590
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:36,180
than it would have been just a market with a firm.

591
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,140
OK.

592
00:46:38,140 --> 00:47:08,100
Okay, is it yeah more questions? Okay now we move to the next question. This

593
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,100
is it good or bad?

594
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,980
Is it desirable to create such a name?

595
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,180
Now, I'm going to say in the globe,

596
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,100
the kind of shops that you find really good with that.

597
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:24,260
The most big caters for the needs and the desires

598
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:28,700
of this 75% of residents and a lot of tourists

599
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,860
and visitors who like to visit the market.

600
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,380
And so that could be a reason to say, well,

601
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,740
it's not desirable to do this.

602
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,540
because these people will not find cheap food in the area

603
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:46,300
for the kind of problems they would like to buy.

604
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,180
But that shows that we are moving to the next question,

605
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,500
the social mix desire.

606
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,580
I guess it would be time for a break.

607
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,340
I'm running a bit behind some into.

608
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:05,340
I'm wondering there is a three hours or a decade

609
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,960
to over-joker.

610
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,620
Boston has been limiting by Boston powers.

611
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,200
We've been big for all, we have a goal of its power

612
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,700
just two hours and one for us.

613
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:23,740
Okay, I'll just go to the slides.

614
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,140
We'll see, we'll see what time, what time,

615
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,620
but I think it's better to have a great job

616
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,540
before moving to this next question.

617
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:39,540

697
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:06,680
I think I need to skim the question number four or part number four.

698
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:14,680
But in any case, I'm really excited to go into the arguments here.

699
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:24,680
And the overarching assumption amongst policy-makers and also in the dominance of high-pumpies

700
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:44,680
Amongst researchers seems to be that very good lift affects your life chances. Whether you lift an end to work in this line clock, this social housing estate, live power.

the difference and the ways in which this question has been answered.

00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:39,520
Observation number one is that researchers working in different subdisciplines

I've been showing you this diagram last week already.

00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,480

734
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,040

people live

737
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,240
and this is that meaning for

738
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,120
in the eradication of poverty for example

739
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,440
so you see that different

740
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:09,240
have been asking different research questions when it comes to these effects of

741
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:13,400
segregation. They have also been using different research mental

742
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:21,280
colleges. We use large surveys. They have a survey of 1,000 people in order to

743
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,240
answer these questions or do you have called it negative research where you

744
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,300
the Interfuge Thirds Fellows,

745
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,740
and we're 13 people living in a thing,

746
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,060
or this place from a thing.

747
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,640
So different research,

748
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,540
mental politics,

749
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,240
and then you've also been reading

750
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,700
in the article by Adam Slather,

751
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,100
that that might also be different ideology

752
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,460
under things,

753
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,500
underlying the work of these different.

754
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,860
So I think it is important for you

755
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,140
to understand that just like I,

756
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,500
I could last week for the courses of segregation

757
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,180
and the different arguments that have been given

758
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:06,620
for why people live in segregated neighborhoods.

759
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:10,500
And also when it comes to these effects of segregation

760
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,100
as a role that's been showed around that

761
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,460
that people are working in different conditions

762
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:19,780
and different sub-disaboots of human geography

763
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,020
have been giving different answers

764
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:26,500
to these questions.

765
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,660
Another remark that I want to give before going

766
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:36,180
to the answer to that question is that it is important

767
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:41,260
to see that studies on neighborhood effects

768
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,620
bear birthmarks.

769
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,980
What do I need with that?

770
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,660
Is it matters to bear a study of the eclipse?

771
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,860
And then often, for example, the literature

772
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,900
of the effects of segregation.

773
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,820
Conducting studies conducted in the United States,

774
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:02,700
the conclusions of these studies have been used, for example,

775
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,780
to influence policy in Western Europe.

776
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:11,480
And a while it is quite important to see the differences

777
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,620
between these different contexts.

778
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,940
Last week, I have been highlighting, for example,

779
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:19,340
that when it comes to desegregation,

780
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:27,340
in the United States, the United States is much stronger or prevalent than it is

781
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,340
in Europe.

782
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:34,100
So there's an important difference when you take the conclusions from one country to

783
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,100
the other.

784
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:42,060
The welfare states in Western Europe has been much more developed than in the United States.

785
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:47,300
So when it comes to poverty and the eradication of poverty, this is a completely different

786
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,880
issue in a Western European context.

787
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,900
And this is an American.

788
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:59,840
So it's important that you contextualize studies

789
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,300
on segregation in the United States, for example.

790
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,780
And then just to not transfer these conclusions

791
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:11,060
to Europe.

792
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:17,820
Many of the studies on neighborhood effects

793
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:22,740
and the effects of segregation have been conducted in the Netherlands.

794
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:27,820
And also this Dutch context is a very peculiar one.

795
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:31,940
Where, for example, concerns about the value,

796
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,980
and also to see there, or particularly neighborhoods

797
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:39,260
in Amsterdam have been quite important in stimulating

798
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:47,260
research field. And being for dying, I don't know whether you're interested in going.

799
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:55,260
But this far-right whole addition to the Netherlands have always been proper for two decades already, have been kept forward.

800
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:03,260
And that's also important to understand why this research field has been sort of developed in the Netherlands.

801
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:10,780
So important to provincialized students and to understand that a study in Vienna or in

802
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:16,620
Antwerp or in Brussels or in the United States that it's important to contextualize,

803
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:21,180
to understand the specificities of this particular context.

804
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:26,700
I have seven answers to this question.

805
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,700
Have you remember the question?

806
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,820
Can impoverished neighborhoods make the residents

807
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,700
worse off or when I'm interested in

808
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:38,220
ethnic cultural segregation and neighborhoods

809
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:43,020
with the concentration of people for origin

810
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,180
make integration more difficult?

811
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:52,220
Um, seven different arguments.

812
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:55,180
The first one, the social network

813
01:02:55,180 --> 01:03:03,180
I think many of you might have heard of Robert Pootman, focusing on social capital,

814
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:08,300
but the social capital, the connections among the visuals, the social networks, the

815
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,300
norms of reciprocity.

816
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:15,860
There's the rules of desiring and trustworthiness that arise from, making a distinction

817
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:20,020
between holding capital, what is falling capital.

818
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:27,020
These are social methods, connections, loans, or reciprocity that means socially homogeneous

819
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,180
people.

820
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:34,820
For example, people of the same ethnicity are people of the same social and economic group.

821
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:39,780
Distinction between only and bridging them of the preaching of the capital, being connections,

822
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:46,060
that works, loans, and reciprocity, and transporatiness, being socially heterogeneous.

823
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:53,940
For example, people of different ethnic countries are people of different social economies.

824
01:03:53,940 --> 01:04:00,420
And the argument is often that rich in capital is important for social mobility.

825
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:09,260
And for example, if you're poor from your middle class neighbor, you will meet here about

826
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,260
jobs.

827
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,260
And it is a version who's working.

828
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,680
And there is a job opportunity that

829
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,680
office workers, persons, persons in my chair is

830
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,460
knowledge, but she might share it with his

831
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,460
worker name.

832
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:26,720
Work and ready to do not speak Dutch, it might

833
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,920
be good to have this wide middle class

834
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,520
family, this university council.

835
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,500
So interested in living next to you, because

836
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,200
you maybe they can help yourself or go

837
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,720
with homework as they speak.

838
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,120
So these are the ideas behind this argument,

839
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,760
saying, well, it's good to have mixed neighborhoods,

840
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,880
because this mixed neighborhoods with leads to heterogeneous networks

841
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,520
that will lead to bridging capital,

842
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,160
and that will make importance.

843
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:05,520
That will be to the benefit of poor people living in such an effort.

844
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,520
And so one reason why you would want to create a social

845
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,320
expert is because you want to create heterogeneous social

846
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,440
networks.

847
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,720
Because you assume that rich in capital will help poor people

848
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,920
to be socially mobile and to join with it.

849
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,920
And for example, through education or through jobs.

850
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,280
And so this is one of the seven arguments

851
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,440
that underpins this ideal of social works.

852
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:41,320
But I'm going to study how people live.

853
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:46,320
It turns out that people are rather mobile in a city

854
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:51,160
to not limit their lives to a particular neighborhood.

855
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,200
And that many of the social networks

856
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,800
that people in a neighborhood spend

857
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,840
different neighborhood borders.

858
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,200
And this is a study from Guangzhou in China.

859
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,720
looking at the social networks of people living in four different types of

860
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,960
neighborhoods and in each of these neighborhoods the conclusion is that most

861
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:23,760
people get to know people through work and spend time with colleagues also after

862
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:31,600
after working hours. Many people also get to know people through kinship from a

863
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,600
childhood to schools of

864
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
graduate children.

865
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,600
And then are actually quite

866
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,600
a small amount of

867
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,600
social mentors in each of these

868
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,600
neighborhoods, less than that

869
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,600
percent.

870
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,600
And, well, you look at the

871
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
social connections of these people.

872
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,600
There's quite a small amount that

873
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,600
helps in these neighborhoods.

874
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,600
And no matter the reach of the four

875
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,600
types of neighborhoods that

876
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,600
People seem to develop mostly boats,

877
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:11,600
connections in that works with people from outside this language.

878
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,600
And so this idea that by bringing the middle of the last work,

879
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,600
the middle of the last two of the middle of the neighborhood,

880
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,600
that this would be a way to create these social networks.

881
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:27,600
And when you look at this, then the social networks also develop outside.

882
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,600
So why do you focus so much on that neighborhood that people live?

883
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:38,600
I'm just very

884
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:43,600
[inaudible]

885
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,600
In other countries you mean

886
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,600
the situation would be different.

887
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:56,600
I told you it's important to understand the complex

888
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,940
and the context of this study.

889
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,760
But in any case, also for which

890
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,620
that European cities, if you're

891
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:06,120
a study, this process is over time.

892
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,800
I think you would find out that

893
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,360
connections are less neighborhood-based

894
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,560
than they used to.

895
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,120
I can imagine that this neighborhood

896
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,080
is more than being an organ.

897
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,640
People still get to know a lot

898
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:23,240
of other families, for example,

899
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,240
through their children, through the school,

900
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,520
in many countries of the world.

901
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,040
You have a school kitchen system

902
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,840
where living in a neighborhood

903
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,880
and sending your kids to the same school.

904
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,400
And so for sure there are many reasons

905
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,520
why this would be different in other countries.

906
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,240
Have an overall, I think this argument is still true

907
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,400
that there are also many social networks

908
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,440
that have outside the neighborhood.

909
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,400
Of course, I also studies that focus on

910
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,480
foreign neighborhoods and say,

911
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,440
well, these people are less mobile and rich people.

912
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,440
So it's exactly for the school people that this neighborhood is an important

913
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:06,440
ground of network for each. Much more than this one, which you know.

914
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:17,440
If you do not have a joke, if you do not have the money to buy a best-in-game club, that is neighborhood context will be a form of form for social networks to develop.

915
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,440
So also for different countries, people this might be.

916
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:27,240
But still I think it's important to see that that merge is another one we've felt inside

917
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,240
the paper.

918
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:36,980
That there are also networks in other parts of the city, or with people living in other parts

919
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,680
of the city.

920
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:45,860
German, drawing, white, double-inkled,

921
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:51,840
families to a neighborhood such as molar make.

922
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,240
And here is possible, well, then

923
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:59,480
make these networks, a study by Sabina Rick

924
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:04,360
and like a un-person in German cities.

925
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:09,040
I think it was not explored in the food area.

926
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:13,380
And they have been interviewing the white,

927
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:17,620
middle class people in this example to women

928
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,180
about their social net.

929
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,880
And there's quite a lot on this diet,

930
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,980
everybody might need to explain it.

931
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:25,460
So you see they're women in the middle.

932
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:30,260
And then you have different scales in the neighborhoods.

933
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,580
You have the city.

934
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:35,140
You have Germany, and you have outside of Germany.

935
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:40,140
So people who are the important people in your life,

936
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:44,440
ask that, and if you put them on this diagram saying,

937
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,800
well, there are people inside the neighborhood,

938
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,280
people living in the same city,

939
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,400
but you also know people in the same country

940
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,640
and people also being grown.

941
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,520
And for different people, you would get to different diagrams.

942
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:01,520
Then what they also did is to map contact frequency.

943
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:08,400
So if you have frequent buildings, this arrow will be born both then it is for people through

944
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,200
you to have rare contacts.

945
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:19,880
And then they also have met a level of education and indicators for class in the Indian

946
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
countries.

947
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:28,320
So you will learn these people that you frequent are they people with the same educational

948
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,320
background.

949
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,960
They would cost people high education,

950
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,160
high-educated, or artists people who do not have

951
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,080
any personal qualifications for this one.

952
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,240
Now, the other thing that you see here

953
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,720
is the type of relation to a frequent

954
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,320
these people or really provide you with emotional support

955
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:51,640
or instrumental materials or a good talk,

956
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,760
or example, how to be used in poverty.

957
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,680
So it's quite a complex map.

958
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:02,920
So what you see is that first of all, just like in the Chinese example, many people have

959
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:09,200
social networks, there are Bartovus social networks with people living outside the neighborhoods.

960
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:15,400
And what you also see there is that most of the connections that these middle-class women

961
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:22,000
in these under-religious neighborhoods develop are with other people with the same

962
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
education qualification.

963
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,200
So the idea that bringing the middle of class people

964
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,400
to an underprivileged neighborhood

965
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,720
will create that an routine is social networks

966
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,520
in which you're finding more enriched people.

967
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,720
There's no single whole truth here.

968
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,320
There's a middle class people that's

969
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,360
you're attracted to these neighborhoods.

970
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,560
The eight mostly social bonds with people like them

971
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,760
with other middle and false people.

972
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,440
And so this bridging capital,

973
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,120
That was the reason why you wanted to exist,

974
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,280
neighborhood.

975
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,680
That's not really the problem.

976
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:04,080
Another argument is that creating a mixed neighborhood

977
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:09,080
might disrupt the strong dice that exist there over it.

978
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,240
The bolding capital that exists

979
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,600
and the strong forms of social economic,

980
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,280
emotional support that people are the same,

981
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,600
that Mississippi, for example, provides you

982
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,180
when they live in a neighborhood,

983
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,600
part of the city.

984
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,440
So residents living in distant parts of cities,

985
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,400
slaves are argued, fall back on what they know,

986
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,480
and what they have each other,

987
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:40,840
this building can also be crucial in the life's home

988
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,240
for people, in the lives of newcomers,

989
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,760
where just arrived to the city,

990
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,240
they were looked for all that excursed,

991
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:54,960
And if you create a mixed neighborhood in these parts of common, for example, by attracting

992
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,800
the middle class, there will display some people and that will disrupt these bone-in-capped

993
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,840
open-assists.

994
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:10,440
And so what I'm trying to do is to say, well, there is an argument there, why you would

995
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:14,440
to create mixed neighborhoods, which are also left

996
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,680
a couple of cancer arguments.

997
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,680
That's the why this argument is

998
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,560
by not to work or to hold a reason

999
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,760
and applying the argument to my not to work.

1000
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,200
Social networks, social capital,

1001
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,600
owning and bridging capital.

1002
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,720
I guess you have a few kinds of points there.

1003
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:38,560
The second argument is called under-place arguments.

1004
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,700
And this is an argument that has developed in the United States

1005
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,620
in the 1980s.

1006
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:50,100
And then finding that there was a big discussion

1007
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:55,100
between structuralists who looked at the causes of poverty

1008
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:57,820
in the declining economic base.

1009
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,060
And for example, Marxist, Trevor first saying, well, there

1010
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:06,380
is a shift from a forest to a post-fortress capitalism.

1011
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:10,180
And this makes it harder for this people to fight with chocolate.

1012
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:15,180
or the arguments that you've heard in the classes by the past of our polarization,

1013
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:19,180
is there a declining job market for this.

1014
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,180
So you look for structure of a goal of a scope forward.

1015
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:25,180
And on the other hand, you have culture groups,

1016
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:30,180
except poverty is dead because you have a culture of poverty.

1017
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:34,180
That poor people have certain attitudes,

1018
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:38,180
have a certain behavior, and this keeps them in poverty.

1019
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:43,020
there was an important discussion between these two.

1020
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:47,060
And this under-class argument is part of this cultural

1021
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,420
history of looking at forward.

1022
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:53,820
And whom is this under-class?

1023
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,660
They're not talking about all four people

1024
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,860
in the case of the United States.

1025
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:02,900
In the 1980s, 33 million people were not.

1026
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:06,580
Who was this under-class that was a minority

1027
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:09,660
in this minority, 5 million people.

1028
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:13,860
And people who follow below the income threshold

1029
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:17,260
for which they are like considered to work.

1030
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:20,780
This proportionally black and spelling minority

1031
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:23,580
in this poor minority, but what defines

1032
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,780
that's not so much over the ordinary base,

1033
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,180
but they're behavior.

1034
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:31,940
They're throwing lawlessness,

1035
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:37,480
to reduce out of record words, lack of a warm and welfare dependency

1036
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,320
for school faith.

1037
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,440
That is sort of this culture, this lane to the poor,

1038
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,380
to be poor because of their own behavior and very

1039
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:49,520
able to do this.

1040
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,680
And so this is this under-class argument.

1041
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:58,160
So what is the argument exactly that in kettles or in neighborhoods

1042
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:04,160
So you find the concentration of two people that you find is more than an employment, more

1043
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:11,680
welfare dependency, more early school living, more truancy, more criminality, more drug

1044
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:18,600
abuse, more alcohol abuse, more out of rent with birth, more teenage pregnancy, more

1045
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:26,700
dysfunctional values, whatever, that in June to socialization effects within

1046
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:35,320
these things, if you grow up in a neighborhood like that, then your peers, people of

1047
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:44,420
your age, the people that you're free and grow at a higher chance to be criminals or

1048
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:49,100
or gamblers or drug users or alcohol abuse, etc.

1049
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:54,420
And that is why in such a route you find more on this.

1050
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,340
You also find a leg of role models really

1051
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,940
junk without a drug without an alcohol

1052
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:05,300
prediction and who are not the age followers, etc.

1053
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,860
So there's a leg of those are the role models.

1054
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:12,580
And you also have this peer group effect.

1055
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:17,260
And so why are you worse off living as a poor person

1056
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:20,460
in a poor neighborhood, the argument of this culture,

1057
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:24,980
this was, that is because you have these norms,

1058
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,820
you have a lack of these role models

1059
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:30,380
and you have this peer group that makes it made that,

1060
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:34,980
well, that's why it's your worst off living in them.

1061
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,460
And I also referred to physical structure,

1062
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:41,660
the solution of that works, the argument was, no.

1063
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,980
This has been quite an important argument.

1064
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:49,060
Many policymakers have been facing or helping

1065
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:53,500
argue in first-person countries because of this.

1066
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:59,020
Because they were convinced that living in an appornable

1067
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:02,060
group increased the chances that you

1068
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:05,100
found the job-less important thing.

1069
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:09,940
These schools early and because of your friends doing the same,

1070
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:14,100
you up to school because your friends met you so as well that you would

1071
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:18,180
turn into a criminal because this is the example that you have seen most

1072
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:21,460
they have already put that set up.

1073
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:28,180
Okay now even when there would be a link between what is on the left and

1074
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:32,180
the spoon neighborhoods then it can still be wondered whether that what is

1075
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:37,300
the causal relationship between these two. Here on the map you have

1076
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:41,900
She's got her again since we are getting quite familiar with.

1077
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,420
You see the poverty level in this neighborhood.

1078
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:50,340
The darker the reds, the poorer the neighborhoods are.

1079
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:59,020
And you see people arrested for drug use or the

1080
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:04,020
or the conversation of authors.

1081
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:10,260
How you see there is that there is a correlation

1082
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:16,620
between over D and the concentration of over D

1083
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:20,580
is neighborhood and use of one of your while there, right?

1084
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,020
Go getting the scratch scanner, which more is patterned.

1085
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:32,020
But you also see that in the other neighborhoods where you have a concentration of poverty

1086
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,020
that this much less begins.

1087
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:46,240
And I can also wonder to what extent this graph is the result of real drug use or the

1088
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,240
policing of these standards.

1089
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:54,380
If you have a police force that is much more on the outlook for drug use instead of the

1090
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:55,500
the name of the Goodswell bank.

1091
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:59,500
It's logical that this will show up in any step distance.

1092
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,940
So there are many reasons why one could raise

1093
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,700
concerns about the goals of a relationship.

1094
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,940
In this case, we could introduce, on the one hand,

1095
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,380
and the concentration of over-theon public

1096
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:14,420
on Goods, as Dr. Kritis says, like, how

1097
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,060
these statistics came about.

1098
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:18,780
One can also see that for certain drugs,

1099
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:22,180
there seems to be a correlation from other certain health.

1100
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:28,580
So I can also see that you have concentrated poverty that corresponds with a lot of errors

1101
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:33,380
for drug use, but that you also have neighborhood with concentration concentrated poverty

1102
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,380
or less, which means.

1103
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:40,020
So there are many reasons why we would start a question whether there is a real causal

1104
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:45,980
relationship, a relationship, a concentration of poverty on the one hand, and all these

1105
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:51,540
other indicators here on the slide on the other hand.

1106
01:21:51,540 --> 01:22:01,220
And another argument against this under-class argument would be, well, again, socialization

1107
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:05,500
be these peers to not only live in these neighborhoods.

1108
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:10,760
These role models do not only live in the neighborhood, but where I go back, but also

1109
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:18,260
in the neighborhood, that we can get this role almost 23 or the music that we're going to

1110
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:22,900
So why is focused on the neighborhood again?

1111
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:27,900
Third argument, the social cohesion argument.

1112
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:36,820
Here you see the basic line of thought of this argument,

1113
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:41,380
when ethnic minorities live isolated from native touch,

1114
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:44,260
they have less contact with native touch.

1115
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,860
Consequently, they do not acquire

1116
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:51,500
an adequate command of the Dutch language are not likely to adopt

1117
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:56,620
Dutch laws, values, and will not succeed in social recognitions.

1118
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:04,540
So, you can see a mixing of arguments about ethnic segregation and social

1119
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:10,300
economic mobility, saying that well, if you're lived in a neighborhood with a high

1120
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:16,220
concentration of people of foreign backgrounds to speak their mother tongue

1121
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:20,220
and we will be able to speak in touch.

1122
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:25,220
And if you have less contact with native Dutch people,

1123
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:30,220
then you will not acquire an adequate command of language.

1124
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:33,220
You are not likely to adopt Dutch moments and values,

1125
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:37,220
and therefore you succeed in social networks.

1126
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:43,220
And other arguments that has been quite important

1127
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:48,220
In the kind of rethorex and the kind of discourse of policy makers

1128
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:52,220
that are advocating a social mix, same for example,

1129
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:55,220
it's not good that in wall make you have a high-down

1130
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:59,220
situation of firms or in both the larger, high-down situation of workers.

1131
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:01,220
Why is that not good?

1132
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:03,220
Well, these people will not get to speak.

1133
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:08,220
Touch and they will not integrate to use that word.

1134
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:12,220
They will not adopt touch laws and values

1135
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:17,900
and that will make it harder for them to climb to social weather.

1136
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:22,260
Again, one can wonder, yeah, is it only in the neighborhood

1137
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:27,380
that people could get a chance to develop this kind of relationships

1138
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:31,420
with native Dutch human arguments to talk to.

1139
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:34,300
We could look at these research, too.

1140
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,060
I'm not going to do all the details that they say about you.

1141
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:42,700
home, that's a place where people develop social networks.

1142
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,840
You've got leisure,

1143
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,460
you've got digital,

1144
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,740
you've got mental health,

1145
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,100
social networks,

1146
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,340
you've got work,

1147
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,060
and you've got the transport between

1148
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:52,060
these three different domains.

1149
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:55,020
So it's important to look at all these domains

1150
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:57,740
and to see what happens between people.

1151
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,820
And then you might see that this neighborhood

1152
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,820
in which these people live is less important.

1153
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:05,940
Another counter-argument with focus

1154
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,620
or is a local culture.

1155
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:11,060
It's only because you have a concentration

1156
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:15,260
of people who are certain ethnic background, for example,

1157
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:20,260
that you can support the show that sells ethnic products

1158
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:24,540
and sell the food, that sells the food from the home group,

1159
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:28,780
where it allows you to have the church or a association

1160
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:32,060
that focusing on a particular ethnic group.

1161
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:35,420
And these kinds of places might be very important.

1162
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:37,540
they will act as a perfected space,

1163
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:39,540
they will act as a safe space,

1164
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:42,140
in which these people feel like they're home.

1165
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:44,900
And this feeling of belonging might be very important

1166
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:49,900
for them to find a life in this new country

1167
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,300
where they are living.

1168
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:55,900
The social cohesion argument.

1169
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:02,420
Before the argument, we'll focus on local services.

1170
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:11,340
And we'll say that, for example, in neighborhoods

1171
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,140
with the concentration of poverty that you

1172
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:16,740
will have less public and private services.

1173
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,220
There will be less shops.

1174
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:21,060
There will be less banks.

1175
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:24,140
And you might also have less public service.

1176
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:27,940
These are examples from Luvibong, social housing

1177
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:31,460
estate that I've been talking about today already.

1178
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,940
and the closure of a bank.

1179
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:37,420
And there is no ADM anymore in other papers.

1180
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:39,300
And the argument could go well

1181
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,660
if that would be more middle to false people

1182
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:43,860
than there would be higher interest

1183
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:47,340
from banks who have an ADM in the bank

1184
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:52,500
or other shops.

1185
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:58,260
Chicago, food deserts, I don't know

1186
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,900
that you've ever heard about this term.

1187
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:05,740
If you look at healthy food, grocery,

1188
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,220
shops, American, you find that,

1189
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:13,220
if you see a map with these different racial groups,

1190
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:17,980
remember this self identification in the case,

1191
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:22,140
America that deserve each racial group to self identify

1192
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,780
with the United States.

1193
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,380
You see neighborhoods, predominantly white,

1194
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,820
like Hispanic Asian, a nurse,

1195
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:32,660
and you see that in many of these blank neighborhoods,

1196
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,980
which are also luxurious neighborhoods,

1197
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:38,060
you find that it's very hard to find.

1198
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,780
Healthy food that's very hard to find fresh vegetables

1199
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,980
and fruit, because these shops are so fine.

1200
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:47,260
And so the argument would be that its better degree,

1201
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:49,940
it makes neighborhood, because that will attract

1202
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:54,940
a library set of shops and services to these neighborhoods.

1203
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,940
We've already been talking about this,

1204
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,860
that the question of course is what kind of shops

1205
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,900
and what kind of services do you get

1206
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:08,020
in the case of this end to our advantage of this street

1207
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,120
one person said, well,

1208
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:12,260
the people will not feel affordable shops

1209
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:14,340
and they will also not find the products

1210
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:16,860
that apply to five shops.

1211
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:20,420
That's also in gentrifying neighborhoods

1212
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:24,980
and what kind of shops do you find there?

1213
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:31,660
as it shows catering for people who look for the cheapest or possible because they have

1214
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:41,300
only five heroes to spend in the last three days of the month, or visit cafes or restaurants

1215
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:46,420
who try to cater for these incoming, tenured pups.

1216
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:53,460
So it's important to look at the difference in the amount that will result from creating

1217
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:59,020
and so the question is if you mix name routes through these shops and services

1218
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:04,980
cater for these cool people because if there's something case then it will

1219
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:10,040
displace the shops that existed there already and that cater for these

1220
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:15,900
audience. The answer we've also been talking about all of these specialized

1221
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:23,060
services that you might get in neighborhoods of Rhode Island at these ony transfer

1222
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:30,060
or a full shot set of African vegetables or high ingredients.

1223
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:36,060
And the question is if you try to mix the neighborhoods,

1224
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:42,060
do these kinds of shops and these kinds of services still be able to be to remain

1225
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:49,060
or will they also be displaced because this place will be involved by a fancy

1226
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:52,820
see, probably shown that it's mainly

1227
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,820
catarities and changing farmers.

1228
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:58,820
So questions around shops, services,

1229
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:03,260
catering for different audits.

1230
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:06,540
A fifth argument that you find in the literature

1231
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,820
is a political one.

1232
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:13,060
Start from the observation that many neighborhood associations,

1233
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:18,060
for example are mainly run by middle class.

1234
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:23,500
And that middle class people are much more vocal

1235
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:26,620
in expressing their concerns from the paper.

1236
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,580
So I'm gonna say that, well,

1237
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:32,260
by attracting the middle class to a poor neighborhood,

1238
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:33,700
this neighborhood will be higher

1239
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,180
for the political agenda.

1240
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:40,700
And I have this quote interprome

1241
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,860
and I have read at the end of the excursion,

1242
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:44,900
which I've got a lot in my channel,

1243
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,340
for people stating,

1244
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:49,340
"Well, there also gets paid or sliding to this."

1245
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,660
To us.

1246
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:54,220
And so the idea is that I'm mixing neighborhoods,

1247
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:57,980
you will put these neighborhoods higher.

1248
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:02,980
Jen, I'm in Belgium, people from outside the youth

1249
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:07,500
with other buildings in Oxford are able to fold

1250
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:13,420
this film not getting case in every country, so if you have a neighborhood with a lot of people

1251
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:19,500
from outside the group, who do not have a say in vocal politics, then why would this

1252
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:26,780
vocal mayors address the concerns of people living? And if these people are not able to

1253
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:33,340
express their needs and to put a stamp on the vocal agenda, but why would you do it?

1254
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:40,860
So the argument is that really class people are able to have these connections with politicians

1255
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:43,340
or at least they will be listened to.

1256
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:56,540
Well, I'm not going to go into that example, but it's out with the enter of highway

1257
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:00,940
that issue of air pollution to be observation

1258
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:04,300
with both of the paper groups lying next to the library

1259
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,580
are up.

1260
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:08,300
So one would question what would happen

1261
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:12,300
with this whole issue of the only dates around the highway.

1262
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,140
If these neighborhoods would want to,

1263
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:17,460
to neighbors, the voters would come,

1264
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:19,260
the broader than they would be the highest

1265
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:23,540
if they would be the show that they did.

1266
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:27,500
So the political arguments by mixing neighborhoods,

1267
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,540
you will put that higher on the political agenda.

1268
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:34,100
Of course, the issue is that why we put the issues of this,

1269
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:38,020
who even, why does that not have priorities

1270
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,420
made for the result of the political agenda,

1271
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:44,780
without these middle-class residents.

1272
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:47,100
The sixth argument is a bit different.

1273
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,860
The spatial mismatch does not focus so much

1274
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:52,980
on the issue of segregation.

1275
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:55,820
But if you follow these five dimensions of--

1276
01:32:55,820 --> 01:33:04,860
We see a benefit it focuses on concentration plus red doe pool people live in which part

1277
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:10,340
of the city are these neighborhoods with the concentration of poverty.

1278
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:16,540
This is a diagram from Cape Town but in old London it's still very much the case.

1279
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:23,820
Where do you have a job of her students in white and where do you have population?

1280
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:28,220
where do people live and where do they, where, where could they?

1281
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:34,620
And most of the drug opportunities are still in the previous new white neighborhoods, particularly

1282
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:37,820
in the central business district of Cape Town.

1283
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:44,540
But most of the poor people in Cape Town are living by far away from these places.

1284
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:49,860
So there is a mismatch between the places where they live and the places where they could

1285
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,660
potential, burning.

1286
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:55,260
And so it's not just important to focus on segregation

1287
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:58,300
and the fact that poverty is concentrated

1288
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,540
in these more peripheral neighborhoods

1289
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:02,220
in the case of big dive.

1290
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:04,500
The genetic focus then also of distance

1291
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,740
between various neighborhoods are

1292
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:09,180
and the places where these people put through.

1293
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:11,260
So there is the spatial mismatch

1294
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:14,620
are focusing on the mismatch between

1295
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:19,060
place of residence and potential places of the world.

1296
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:28,320
Rest in European cities, then to have a better public transport than most American for

1297
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,320
cyber.

1298
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:34,500
So one of the other big issues is argument to the whole list through in the case of Brussels

1299
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:41,000
for example, even if you live in a field world, there are good train connections to

1300
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:53,320
of nature places. This is a meant for Brussels, Joe Ben City, you see two clusters, the inner city,

1301
01:34:53,320 --> 01:35:01,560
and all these offices, and the area around the airport. Where the poor people in Brussels

1302
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:09,160
lived mostly in this 19th century, boats around the inner city, meaning that there's not so

1303
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,120
So much of the spatial mismatch.

1304
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:15,560
If you live in all of make, you can walk to many job opportunities.

1305
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,960
Of course, the question that this barely

1306
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,800
have most guilt job opportunities.

1307
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,240
Or if you don't need all of communication,

1308
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:27,480
then you see that more or less the same clusters

1309
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,000
appear.

1310
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,320
Of course, as jokes shift towards the airport,

1311
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:36,120
the issue is what are the transport connections

1312
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:40,880
between Wollumbeg, St. Joseph, the Wollus, and Joseph,

1313
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,880
and these areas where you find the growth

1314
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,360
of most new, or most new jobs.

1315
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,560
And in the case of Brussels, the issue will also be,

1316
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:54,880
whether the language requirements for these jobs,

1317
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,280
because these are Joseph flowers,

1318
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:02,120
what kind of a touch proficiency to a need,

1319
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,960
and also for these jobs that are repulsion, French,

1320
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,240
and you also English, so just language wise,

1321
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:13,160
these jobs are already quite difficult.

1322
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,880
So the spatial mismatch argument focusing

1323
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,960
on the location of these poor neighbors.

1324
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:23,440
So it's not just how mixed these neighborhoods are,

1325
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:24,920
whether poor and rich, they decide

1326
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,680
by side, but where do these concentrations

1327
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,000
of overty occur?

1328
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,600
Last argument statement is each,

1329
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,400
And this is an argument that Slater has been writing about

1330
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,840
is important to look what happens outside

1331
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,560
of these neighborhoods under scrutiny.

1332
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:47,680
And why is it harder to climb the social weather

1333
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,920
and body of it on all of the developments

1334
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,720
because teachers who live outside these neighborhoods

1335
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:58,200
from where the set of stereotypes or pupils in these schools

1336
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:02,640
and that will look different at the same educational

1337
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:06,760
chances as people going to school in other meetings.

1338
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,200
Or if you're both going to this, and you know

1339
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,800
what is the post-code report, what made with you,

1340
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,480
apply for a joke, then you, okay,

1341
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,320
you're one thousand meters.

1342
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,600
If you have a driver, a joke, and this is your address

1343
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,280
is there, then potential and borders

1344
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,960
might already come to the center of stereotypes,

1345
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,000
why not too high?

1346
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So why would it be good then to create the social mix?

1347
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:36,320
Well, one could create a one-point argue for a social mix

1348
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,080
because that will reduce the stigma of attitudes

1349
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,680
or the stigma attached to this gap.

1350
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:47,520
Of course, there might also be other ways

1351
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,440
to work on that stigma.

1352
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,040
You don't need a mix to do that.

1353
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,880
You also can make people living outside this neighborhood.

1354
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,120
So you can make that more air off.

1355
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:00,760
And what this really happens is silence and the difference.

1356
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:03,880
There's a bit of stigmatization, life of nature,

1357
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,360
employers or teachers or police men

1358
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,760
who are working in this neighborhood,

1359
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,480
but who do not live there,

1360
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:16,280
will be another argument to buy social mix is necessary.

1361
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:22,520
So are people living in impoverished prisons?

1362
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:25,160
Well, doesn't matter whether you are poor,

1363
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:30,720
mostly poor neighborhoods surrounded by people like you.

1364
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:34,720
or whether you live as a poor person in a mixed name.

1365
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,960
Just that matter.

1366
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:39,120
And our seventh arguments that I have given down

1367
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,120
as to why that could matter.

1368
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:44,480
For each of these seven,

1369
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:47,360
I've also given a couple of counter-audicates.

1370
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:52,000
As to why I creating a mixed,

1371
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,640
it should be a bad thing to distract,

1372
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:58,280
to advise that exists already.

1373
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:04,200
are is not necessary because people find peers and role models outside the environment.

1374
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:13,960
For people with a class, people arrive in these neighborhoods, well not create social networks,

1375
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:19,320
different people, this better order, etc. So for each of these arguments, I've given

1376
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:29,480
a couple of counter arguments. What about the privilege? I will skip that. But in

1377
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:37,000
those data spaper you will find many arguments for that. I will get to a small conclusion.

1378
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:45,800
Okay, so when we discuss this ideal of social mix, when we discuss the question of

1379
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:50,360
which is social mixed feasible, is social mixed desirable.

1380
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,840
Now, when it's my take on it, I think,

1381
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:55,040
of his home and we,

1382
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,600
who has been doing a lot of vertical housing

1383
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,160
here in Brussels,

1384
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,160
has summarized this quite well through.

1385
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:05,480
The concept of social mixed here runs,

1386
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,920
which now legitimizes a good part

1387
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,440
of the regional interventions

1388
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:14,120
in the area of housing here in Brussels,

1389
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:17,120
just looking at the Brussels step of the region

1390
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:20,600
and how the idea of social mixed-minded concept

1391
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:25,620
of social mixed-

1392
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:29,880
is occurring to a very non-spading conference,

1393
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:33,720
the gentrification reaches underweight

1394
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,840
in the central neighborhoods,

1395
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:40,520
in those neighborhoods where these authorities are doing

1396
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:44,760
in a big effort to attract valid possible products.

1397
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:48,120
Indicates that when there is a mix,

1398
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:53,120
it is only a prelude to the eviction of the most disadvantaged

1399
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:56,200
fire the mechanisms of a completely

1400
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,440
deteriorated real estate market.

1401
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,600
Really in a city,

1402
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:06,600
where only 10% of the total residential units

1403
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:14,320
our social house, and there is almost no control over the remaining 90%.

1404
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:25,280
And so if you try to attract little class residents to these 19th century industrial labor books

1405
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:30,960
around Brussels, if you do that, then it will push out over the elsewhere. You see that in the

1406
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,560
the snap of a tree, where there are these poor people moving out of a gentrifying

1407
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:42,200
nature, started it both to build on to oust, to really get into the hollow, to

1408
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:48,920
shower the water, to my shadow. Yeah, you move over the elsewhere. So when there

1409
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:54,160
is a mix, you can exist for a while, but then it's only a privilege to be a

1410
01:41:54,160 --> 01:42:00,200
fiction of most is a fantasy. Because rents will go up eventually. And these poor

1411
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:03,440
people that live there are not able to afford these rents,

1412
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:07,320
they will need to move elsewhere to find the next mistake.

1413
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:11,880
So this social makes feasible in the case of Brussels,

1414
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:17,680
with very little control of authorities on the housing market.

1415
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:21,080
No, this is not feasible, shall we?

1416
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,480
Is it desirable?

1417
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,560
A second question that I asked.

1418
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,080
Even if this eviction could be a forked,

1419
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:35,120
And even if you think of a situation where at much, 25% social housing everywhere, 50%

1420
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:39,760
and you will not evict these poor people from these neighborhoods,

1421
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:47,280
then she argues there is nothing to indicate that these disadvantaged populations would eventually

1422
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,480
benefit in any rate from these nips.

1423
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:57,920
F1 because the attraction of this middle league penalties will change the shops for

1424
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:05,360
a regular, will not lead to these heterogeneous networks that these policy makers three

1425
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:05,680
and off.

1426
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:16,320
Yeah, will not lead to the kind of social cohesion that underlies this social cohesion.

1427
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:23,840
does not make the kind of role models that people who

1428
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:27,200
believe in the spendery class argument

1429
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,760
who are looking for, et cetera.

1430
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,720
And so she's arguing in the case of Brussels again,

1431
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:36,320
it's important to revitalize these studies

1432
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:39,120
and to understand the complexity of the Brussels case

1433
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:43,840
only 10% social housing over the at this moment

1434
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:47,200
concentrated in neighborhoods with quite a critical

1435
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,160
very close to these jobs.

1436
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:54,240
And so there are many particularities that we need to understand.

1437
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:58,160
But what is arguing is that kind of social mix

1438
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:01,200
that this person's capital picture tries to create

1439
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:04,160
leads to the displacement of people,

1440
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,320
to neighborhoods, to parts of the city,

1441
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:10,760
which are much less connected to job opportunities.

1442
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:15,360
I refined much less jobs and services that paid the for this.

1443
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,360
That's right.

1444
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:20,720
So to much worse locations actually.

1445
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,600
And even if this kind of mixed could be realized,

1446
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:27,320
she argues, then this is not desirable.

1447
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,840
Then this advantage population will not benefit from this.

1448
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:34,200
This will not help them to plan the social better.

1449
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:38,200
As she will draw on all the seven counter arguments

1450
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:44,240
that I've given to substantiate this claim.

1451
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:56,080
So, well, I think when you, I remember that I once asked an exam question such as

1452
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:01,560
"would yourself you choose all the manner of N-word, do another manner of N-word, but

1453
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:06,600
you verbal against social mixed policies or not?"

1454
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,800
The question was a bit more complicated.

1455
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,460
I think it's important that when you have such a question,

1456
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:16,600
when you have a group for a city already

1457
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,960
who has discussed this from an academic point of view,

1458
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,880
I think there are a couple of questions

1459
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:24,040
that you need to ask yourself.

1460
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:25,120
Yes.

1461
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:28,000
The first one is whom are we talking about?

1462
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,880
Why do we treat?

1463
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,320
Why do we want to create a social mix?

1464
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:37,080
Isn't because we say, well, this is the interest

1465
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:42,080
under privilege or I've skipped now most of this at heart.

1466
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:45,080
The class could also be interested in the privilege.

1467
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:48,080
I mean, I'm a member of the original Scout,

1468
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:53,080
one of the richer, richer richest municipalities of Belgium

1469
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,080
and some of you said well,

1470
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:58,780
it could be good to have some more diverse

1471
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:02,080
years because people like, for example,

1472
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,080
change the way they think about people

1473
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,360
they have some of them living close by.

1474
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:33,880
You see that all of the arguments so far have been dealing with the unknown group. So for that reason, I think it's important to ask your question, what about the crucial questions. And in the discussion, seven years that we as next week, there will be one paper that happens together with the real male and post-galbert, they could deal with the question. So we have a chance to come back to the issue.

1475
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,120
and we have discussions.

1476
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:41,920
Do we only focus on social economic segregation?

1477
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:46,240
Are we also interested in ethnic arguments?

1478
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:47,600
And you're seeing, for example,

1479
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:52,080
a social cohesion argument, the two are conflated.

1480
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,640
So do we want to create a social mix

1481
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,960
in the interest of ethnic minorities

1482
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,720
or does that have a majority,

1483
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:04,180
that still exists because more and more cities

1484
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:08,500
in Belgium do not have a majority of people.

1485
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:11,940
So we also think about this group,

1486
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:15,980
frankly, to problemate such policies.

1487
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:20,020
Are we interested in the several residents who

1488
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:23,460
are there already, who are we mainly thinking

1489
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:26,620
about few cops for the horizons?

1490
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:29,340
So I think this question for whom

1491
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,440
So we want to create a social experience.

1492
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:37,620
And most interests is the first one that you should ask.

1493
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:41,700
A second one is the issue of scale.

1494
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:43,940
I told you last week already, scale

1495
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:45,860
is the crux of the matter.

1496
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:49,100
If you want to calculate segregation finishes,

1497
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:52,420
it matters that we scale, we do so.

1498
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:55,220
In Belgium, we have the straightest small statistical units

1499
01:47:55,220 --> 01:48:01,140
for that reason, we find that that's high levels of segregation.

1500
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:04,540
And if you would make these statistical units bigger,

1501
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:08,060
then that would be less segregation.

1502
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:12,140
Your comment about the red square relates to this.

1503
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:16,380
We can create a social mix in this very small neighborhood.

1504
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:19,500
And if you would look at the bigger picture,

1505
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,740
if you would look at this A-monch in area of emperor,

1506
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:26,460
as well as all the news found out that there is no social business,

1507
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:29,540
it's mostly relative to a certain level.

1508
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:33,380
So I think scale is a very important issue,

1509
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:38,660
as well as the question where do we want to create a social business.

1510
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:43,340
I think that most of the social mixed literature

1511
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:46,660
is concerned with this disadvantage, neighborhoods.

1512
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:49,180
The focus is on these neighborhoods

1513
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:51,420
and the need to create a social business.

1514
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:57,420
If you would look at all the make, you would look at social economic position of people.

1515
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:02,300
If you would look at ethnic maker of this neighborhood, you would find out that the

1516
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:09,100
whole make is maybe the most social image's name roots of Russell's original culture.

1517
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:15,700
And the most of the homogeneous neighborhoods are white suburban municipalities.

1518
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:19,780
So why are we only concerned with this disadvantage

1519
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:20,980
neighborhoods?

1520
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:25,420
How are we not concerned with the homogeneity

1521
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:28,300
of many of these suburban groups?

1522
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,820
Which are better off.

1523
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:33,860
Is there a need to create a social mixed slope or not?

1524
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:36,940
And I've imbed a shout for those who join to enter by

1525
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:39,620
be talking about the way they protest that they

1526
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:42,820
can't stop training against the local asylum center

1527
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:51,260
against any attempts to make this an usability.

1528
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:54,900
One good even argued that most of the literature and most

1529
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:57,740
of the concerns of policy leaders

1530
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:02,180
target only those this advantage neighborhoods,

1531
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:06,420
which are change-refiable, which have the potential

1532
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:09,460
to attract really close newcomers.

1533
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:11,180
Because that's good for them.

1534
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:15,740
Next, then the question becomes rare is this possible.

1535
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:19,500
And then enter, we have been on the triangle,

1536
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:22,260
square, bowling plank.

1537
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:28,260
But if you look at the houses, there are many fancy houses,

1538
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:33,260
which are potential homes for rich families.

1539
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:38,740
If you move more to the north, you only find

1540
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:43,160
very small houses which will never attract this kind of.

1541
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:46,020
Rarely I have debates about social mix,

1542
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:49,220
about the needs to gentrify neighborhoods well.

1543
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:50,700
Only in certain,

1544
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:54,560
you know, limited amount of this is a factor.

1545
01:50:54,560 --> 01:51:00,460
So I think this rare question is an important,

1546
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:04,500
rare, are we interested in data social issues?

1547
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,540
You know, notice that these discussions focus

1548
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:09,140
of a very limited number of neighborhoods.

1549
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:15,420
Another issue is never discussed in other parts of the city.

1550
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:19,540
It's also important to look at the issue of scaling

1551
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:23,700
already discussed that, here again, many of our maps

1552
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:27,700
only focus on and for the Russell's capital region.

1553
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:31,620
But I've told you that many of these waterbed effects

1554
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:34,740
have consequences in other parts of the urban region

1555
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:37,300
or even other parts on the bench.

1556
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:40,260
If housing prices in Brussels, Europe,

1557
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:43,840
this has effects in

1558
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,240
shall I want, this makes us walking around in

1559
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:48,420
my shape of hope and see the poverty there.

1560
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:51,220
And for we go to the proposal,

1561
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:54,280
the filmmaking French, quite far away from Brussels

1562
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,100
and we see these effects there,

1563
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:58,140
or need over needed care.

1564
01:51:58,140 --> 01:52:01,060
All these municipalities are affected

1565
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:03,580
by this gentrification.

1566
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:10,580
So it's important that we discuss this issue at the scale of at this deep urban region.

1567
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:18,580
So for whom, in whose interest do we want to create social mixed layer?

1568
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:19,580
Do we want to do it?

1569
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:22,580
Which neighborhoods are we actually talking about?

1570
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:27,580
And then I think it's also important to focus on this wide question.

1571
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:34,540
If you want to create a social use to counter-operatively or even to stimulate the

1572
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:41,340
sculptural integration, then I think that there might be many policy alternatives which

1573
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:46,940
are less costly and which may have much bigger effects.

1574
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:54,940
I'm not going to go too much to do this, but you can imagine that you can try to combat

1575
01:52:54,940 --> 01:53:04,700
poverty, not through the spatial intervention, but through other kinds of social and welfare

1576
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:12,700
that's correct. Is it to improve the local text bits? We've seen this course from this elder man

1577
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:18,860
who gets, I think for many dozens, it still will be an important one. Why do we find gentrification

1578
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:27,900
important. And why do we want to attract the middle class to the city? It is because then it's good

1579
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:35,260
to learn our views of budget. But then even then, I will always be this very coloring of this is

1580
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:41,420
in the interest of who people have included. And this will eventually help them by the social

1581
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:46,780
that. Create social mixed-to-counter racist or

1582
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:53,060
pluses stereotypes. What will that mean? I guess that would mean that we would

1583
01:53:53,060 --> 01:54:00,300
rethink rare and for whom we try to create a social mix. You see that in most

1584
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:08,660
of the policy discourse this is quite absent. If stigmatization is one of

1585
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:19,660
other reasons why living in Poland or for a government or come to a different world makes your life more difficult than other parts of the city.

1586
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:22,660
It's a bit about stigmatization and discrimination.

1587
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:28,660
Now what kind of spatial interventions can be needed to counter these stereotypes.

1588
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:33,660
I think you would create social mixing of the three different ways.

1589
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:45,100
So this is a bit of an open ended conclusion with a lot of questions, but I hope that by giving

1590
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:52,720
your arguments for social mixed and cancer arguments against and by encouraging your

1591
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:59,620
to think about the context in which you want to create a social mixed or not that you

1592
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:07,460
are able to think critically about the effects of segregation and needs to create a social

1593
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,540
mix or much.

1594
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:19,220
And five plus seven, I propose that we almost leave it here for now.

1595
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:24,900
We still have time to discuss all these issues next week in the seminar.

1596
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:29,300
All these texts will deal again with patterns of segregation

1597
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:30,980
and the effects are safe.

1598
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:36,300
So I think it's good that we have time to discuss this next week,

1599
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:41,620
Monday for the geographers and the people from planning

1600
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:44,260
and have our students.

1601
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:47,180
Is this information correct?

1602
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:51,780
Next week Monday, we have eight papers in presentations

1603
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:53,700
to discuss.

1604
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:56,260
I don't see any comments.

1605
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:59,540
So I suppose that this is the schedule as it is.

1606
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:03,580
And then next week, Tuesday and Thursday,

1607
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:09,100
we have two other seminars for students from MUSH

1608
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:11,860
and Thursday students from four cities.

1609
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:14,740
Yeah?

1610
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:16,540
Is that correct?

1611
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:19,500
Yes, all your presentations are there.

1612
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:20,860
You find your names.

1613
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:29,540
This is the information that I've learned from the ovens, 10 minutes.

1614
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:35,540
And we will need to be a rather strict, more distracting,

1615
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:43,420
that's maximum, especially having eight presentations in the first

1616
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:44,540
seminar.

1617
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:52,260
But also in the other seminars, I prefer to keep the time and

1618
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:55,260
through limit these presentations to 10 minutes

1619
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:58,360
because otherwise there's nothing applied for discussion.

1620
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:01,860
These are discussions and not presentations.

1621
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:05,040
So, limit your presentations to 10 minutes

1622
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,920
include a slide with title, names, email,

1623
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,140
I don't know all of you, so it's important

1624
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:12,940
that I'm able to mark the presentations

1625
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:15,620
and connect with the script arise students.

1626
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:18,780
Remember that I need a core report or argument,

1627
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:21,740
a link with the required readings.

1628
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:25,040
Remember that we also expect all students

1629
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:29,540
who have read all the papers of the required readings.

1630
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:32,240
So I suppose that Slater has been read

1631
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:35,180
by thanking all of our gentlemen and dessert.

1632
01:57:35,180 --> 01:57:38,860
And then they spoke a gentle vibe of children.

1633
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:43,860
And then important in order to not to lose too much time

1634
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:49,060
with technical issues, I would like all of you

1635
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:54,900
to send to our power ports or ETF or whatever you're going to support your presentation.

1636
01:57:54,900 --> 01:58:01,900
At least 30 minutes before the seminar, to my email address, whether we transfer link to

1637
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:09,060
necessary, if you want me to check with the presentation, perhaps on my computer, it's

1638
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:13,060
a seven-year, but I suggest you to do that.

1639
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:19,060
So maybe already evening before, and then ask me if you check with it, the power of

1640
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:23,560
one's bird's room, doing it in a PDF so that the different power of one's versions

1641
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:26,760
things change my eyes to change.

1642
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:32,760
At least then, before the presentation, so there are items I'm to present in the future,

1643
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:41,560
so let me go to the sign with the sorting of laptops and the laptops that can't make

1644
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:49,760
a connection with the screen. Just to make sure that we are all able to present,

1645
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:55,160
let me have time to discuss the papers and then we also allow us to discuss everything

1646
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:56,660
that has been said.

1647
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:59,660
and lost it.

1648
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:03,660
Okay, now I'm going forward to see you next week.

[ Inaudible ]

1664
02:01:40,100 --> 02:02:09,100
and we are trying to teach by the information. And then we are going to have a question. And then we are going to have someone with a question. And I guess I am going to say that we are going to do that. And then we have a question. So, we have a question. So, we have a question. And then these people have been added to the list.

1665
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:14,100
Okay, yeah, but I've always did the toughest of one guy.

1666
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:19,100
She had emailed through 40, two or thousands of kids.

1667
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:22,100
She said, "Well, I can't assume the flight."

1668
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:24,100
And it's a good list.

1669
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:27,100
Maybe that could be a main death.

1670
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:30,100
Yeah, who knew her, but I could show her.

1671
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:34,100
If not for next week, then for...

1672
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:35,100
I think it's a good idea.

1673
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:36,100

I think it's a good idea.

1694
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:58,100
Okay. Yeah.

1695
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:01,100
I'm wondering if I want to get my work on the other hand.

1696
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:02,100
So yeah.

1697
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:06,100
I think I get the answer from Adam, for example.

1698
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:08,100
That's what I think.

1699
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:10,100
But maybe.

1700
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:11,100
Yeah.

1701
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:12,100
That's what I think.

1702
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,100
Yeah.

1703
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:17,100
My mother was in the schedule and I felt like it's the...

1704
02:03:17,100 --> 02:03:18,100
But that was the last thing.

1705
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:21,100
And I wanted to schedule for a run.

1706
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:23,100
These students as well.

1707
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:26,260
but also it's things when I see it.

1708
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:29,700
So I don't know how to use these blue key.

1709
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:31,300
Yeah, sounds.

1710
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:32,300
Okay.

1711
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:35,500
So I can go through the window below.

1712
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:36,500
Okay.

1713
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:37,500
Okay.

1714
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,100
We're on this side.

1715
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:40,100
Yes.

1716
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:41,100
Thank you.

1717
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:42,100
Thank you.

1718
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:45,100
I want to--

1719
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:46,100
I want to--

1720
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:47,100
Okay.

1721
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:50,700
I'm actually thinking about we have to write for four

1722
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:52,700
[INAUDIBLE]

1723
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:54,700
[INAUDIBLE]

1724
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:56,700
[INAUDIBLE]

1725
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:58,700
[INAUDIBLE]

1726
02:03:58,700 --> 02:04:00,700
[INAUDIBLE]

1727
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:04,700
[INAUDIBLE]

1728
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:06,700
[INAUDIBLE]

1729
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:08,700
[INAUDIBLE]

1730
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:11,700
So the first thing is, can we

1731
02:04:11,700 --> 02:04:14,700
call like any project that aims to attract

1732
02:04:14,700 --> 02:04:19,700
and the quality of life in a neighborhood like this.

1733
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:25,180
Don't blame the taxi in this kind of project.

1734
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:27,780
Can we call the our social mix projects?

1735
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:30,920
- But they also have a project.

1736
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:34,220
So, we should also say that that's 100%.

1737
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:36,100
That's a little.

1738
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:43,100
Or, or, if still that, not really just.

1739
02:04:43,740 --> 02:05:10,920
infr

1740
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:22,920
and so we're seeing that people are too busy, they're important to attract another guy and he's seen this.

1741
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:30,920
So then you can see that this is what things are.

1742
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:39,040
Do you have any few have already some references that talk about Brussels when I feel

1743
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:45,100
I'm also in the presentation I've not shown that there is quite a rich video of

1744
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:46,100
your opinion.

1745
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:49,060
So if I look at this big result I will find some more.

1746
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:53,880
Well I think you will find a lot of all my beautiful benefits from ownership support policies

1747
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:57,480
in Brussels that's where this quote comes from.

1748
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:00,920
And Madhu van Krikeen moving in out of Brussels.

1749
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:07,080
Madhu of his work is on gentrification, but you also see that some of his papers deal with social

1750
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:12,440
mixed and relation to gentrification specifically. So there's a lot of work.

1751
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:22,520
And the other thing that I don't know if I'm mistaken, but I have the impression that

1752
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:29,320
There's not actually evidence that some people actually are like you presented some arguments,

1753
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,560
but they're not pretty.

1754
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:34,920
What advice is it's already?

1755
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:37,320
Well, I love superstitions and...

1756
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:42,680
Well, I think that if I'm given an old paper, just why they could show me,

1757
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:49,720
trying to find out who can be the effects and showing that there are some pieces where

1758
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:56,440
people might benefit trust. But even then, especially for all these

1759
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:01,640
only the two best creation of mixed neighborhood. What's quite costly?

1760
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:05,000
Yes. What would have a few wins? Just a nice

1761
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:09,320
structural problem. Yes, if you would use all this money to

1762
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:12,840
a triangle not over a conflict with different.

1763
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:17,840
And so even if it turns out social networks,

1764
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:22,840
I think it's a good experience.

1765
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:27,840
But yeah, so even if it turns out

1766
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:32,840
by creating social mix you improve the situation,

1767
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:36,840
people, aggression groups, and this, what would that be?

1768
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:39,840
So it would try and...

1769
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:46,840
[inaudible]

1770
02:07:46,840 --> 02:08:09,840
>> Yes, and back for five. >> Yes, and back for five. >> Yes, I think. >> The military. >> I think it's fine. >> In ruling, schools, schools, schools, schools. >> Okay. >> Thank you very much. >> Thank you very much. >> We have also planned to discuss next next. >> Yes, I think.
