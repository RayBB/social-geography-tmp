1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
I'll start recording immediately because I forgot to start recording for the lecture of

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,280
clear, at least for part of this.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Let me see here.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,280
[no audio]

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,280
[no audio]

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:36,280
[no audio]

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:59,280
[Silence]

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Can everyone hear me?

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,280
Yeah, I see shaking ass those goods.

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,040
I now also open to chat.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,040
I finally found out how to build the chat while

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,520
being in a formal presenting mode.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,520
I think it's about time to start.

14
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,680
Welcome to the second lecture for urban social geography,

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,520
where I'll be spending the next two hours.

16
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,040
Let's see how much time we need for electric urban cultures.

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,120
So as you remember in the last session,

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,800
I largely gave an historical overview of what I consider

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,280
to be essential, let's say, core coordinates

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,960
of thinking about culture in urban geography

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
and more widely some other, let's say,

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,600
related to discipline, starting with a brief discussion,

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,920
well, but there are relatively specifically discussion

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,160
on Fred O.G. Jameson and his notion of postmodernism,

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,840
moving to the shift of, moving to, let's say,

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,840
the 1980s, early 1990s debate on postmodern urbanism

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,920
and the LA School of Urbanism,

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,080
and then shifting to a wider,

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,120
but also related to the bait on the symbolic economy.

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,320
Those were the key coordinates that I tried to get across.

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,320
One of the questions, well,

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,880
you can't see the slides.

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,320
Can everyone see the slides?

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,160
Oh, that's odd.

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,280
Thank you for asking the question

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,560
because I'm actually screen sharing now.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,200
Let me just see, I'll just stop sharing.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:41,880
should be able to see this lights. Another sec. Share screen. I'll do it like this

39
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:52,400
done. So do this. Just a sec. Okay, now see my screen. Except that I can't see

40
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,160
you now just a sec. This is lots. I don't know one near you.

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:09,440
You never see the slides now? I see one yes thank you so I hope that's okay. Perfect. Okay.

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,680
Okay thanks a lot. Yeah feel free to unmute sometimes that's easier than working with

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:25,320
sign language. The only thing is I can see you now. Let me see where is that. Just

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,800
want to say, oh here we are. Okay, now I see you and hopefully you see me and we see

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,280
the slides. You did hear what I was saying, right? So okay, let's keep it from there.

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,240
So what I tried to get across last week is what I just discussed. I tried to give an historic

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,240
overview of some of the core elements that I thought I think were are important. Thinking

48
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,520
about every culture over the last 30, 40 years actually. Open some people in the waiting room.

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:57,720
My life is so easy. Let me see. Before you start working here, where are we? No, no, no, no.

50
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll stop sharing again. I'll admit all again at some point it becomes a bit tricky. Then people

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,200
that just have to wait for the next pause, otherwise it becomes difficult. Because with the

52
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,100
session of clear I could actually manage this but since I don't have an

53
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,620
assistant next to me this is what will work with okay next round we'll

54
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,300
we'll go for another ride here we go

55
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,740
Jabs and starts

56
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:39,220
this is valid that I don't see you anymore

57
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,220
Here we are.

58
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
There we are.

59
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Okay.

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,220
Getting there.

61
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,220
So, for the third time.

62
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,220
I tried to give an historical overview.

63
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
One of the questions I received last week is okay.

64
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,220
Are we going to learn more about actual cultures, so cultural expressions, stuff that

65
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,220
interests us as 20 years, 20 years.

66
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,220
That's what I remember.

67
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,220
So the question to the answer to that question is yes.

68
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,620
In the session today, I will focus a bit more in detail on specific, well, I will always focus on

69
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,460
research on urban culture, but look, assuming in more specifically on research that looks at

70
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,060
actual cultural expressions, but always from perspective as to how this has been done in urban

71
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,020
studies. There are many other disciplines, of course, that focus on culture or cultural expressions

72
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,580
coming from the humanities in particular, but I will largely zoom in on how this has been

73
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,160
in approach within urban studies.

74
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,100
That will hopefully become clear or clearer in a minute.

75
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,820
Before I do so, I want to broaden the debate a bit

76
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,460
beyond urban geography per se.

77
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,060
And I show some of the slides and discuss some of the slides

78
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,860
that I also already mentioned last week.

79
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,020
Because if you look at the way urban geography

80
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,580
has undergone its own cultural term,

81
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,980
as I hinted at last week,

82
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,340
What we saw happening in parallel is that many other disciplines

83
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,220
within the social science and humanities

84
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,740
have also undergone a kind of spatial turn.

85
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,620
So we've seen a kind of meeting health way,

86
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,500
a kind of rapprochement between geography becoming

87
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,020
a more cultural discipline,

88
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,060
but other disciplines also becoming more

89
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,100
becoming more geographical becoming more spatial.

90
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,620
So this cultural, this spatial turn had a number of reasons

91
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,140
as I already mentioned I think last week.

92
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,220
What did I'm being a post-1989 obsession with globalization?

93
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,180
So the moment you start thinking seriously about globalization,

94
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,500
you quasi automatically start thinking about spatial issues

95
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,260
about geographical issues because if it's here,

96
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,540
but also somewhere else,

97
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,820
you start thinking about connections.

98
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,060
The other one being a kind of critique of modernity,

99
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,060
which had really shaped

100
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,620
that they most of the social science and humanities debate

101
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,700
up until the 1970s,

102
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,780
which primarily sort of paid attention to temporal issues

103
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,300
time because that's the very logic of taking in terms of modernity. So what we've seen over

104
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,980
the years since the late 1970s, roughly speaking, is we've seen it's kind of de-emphasizing

105
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:15,620
of temporal issues and an emphasizing of spatial issues. And this is where the spatial turn comes in.

106
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,660
So this in turn, and this is what I want to briefly focus on for the opening of this today's

107
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,020
session, led to an increased interaction between urban geography, urban anthropology, and cultural

108
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,420
studies. Many other disciplines also, but for me those are some of the core disciplines that really

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:38,500
shaped the future of the research on urban culture at large.

110
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,900
Now there are

111
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:59,660
A number of core teams in urban anthropology and and or cultural studies that has shaped the late 20th century early 21st century trajectory of what I consider to be let's say interdisciplinary urban studies.

112
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,660
I'm not going to give a review here of urban anthropology or cultural studies. They're both fascinating disciplines.

113
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,660
I heard a lot more than most disciplines.

114
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,660
I mean, I was trained in cultural studies myself before becoming a geography you could say.

115
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,460
But there are two, let's say, teams that I want to briefly flag here, which I think have

116
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,620
a much longer history in anthropology and cultural studies, which have really picked up

117
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,460
in this scenario of studies and shaped this debate up to the present day.

118
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,180
The first debate being around what I lay on here is informality, as it kind of debate

119
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,020
that emerged in anthropology and development studies,

120
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,160
largely focusing on informal economy, labor markets,

121
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,380
precarious work, migration issue of workers,

122
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,620
legality and illegality distinction,

123
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,380
but also the regulation, so the political governance

124
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,180
of infomality.

125
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,580
I'll give a few examples in a minute.

126
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,100
The second core team that I think is important to keep in mind

127
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,100
as a kind of understanding of the history

128
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,980
of research on urban culture is research on everyday life.

129
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,860
That's a term that you don't see the term used that much anymore.

130
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,860
I would say in the last 10 years or so, you still see it a lot, but less so as a theoretical

131
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,860
concept.

132
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:24,540
But it was a term that was pretty much dominoes in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s.

133
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,540
Largely used as a kind of shorthand or kind of bus work for referring to issues around

134
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:34,780
agency, community, community building, also resistance issues, as well as consumption identity

135
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:42,780
questions and related to representational questions, which then in turn had often a lot to do with how things were represented in media.

136
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:52,780
So, everyday life refers to many things, just as informality refers to many things, but if you would have to give a kind of nutshell summary, this life pretty much covers the other thing.

137
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,340
Now briefly, if you think about informality within

138
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,820
biologic urban anthropology and development studies,

139
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,940
it's a term that was less used in cultural studies.

140
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,820
It's a classic team, especially from the early 1970s onwards.

141
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,660
The core reference and perhaps the first person

142
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,460
who coined the idea of the informal economy,

143
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,780
that many others, of course,

144
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,700
who did research on the informal economy

145
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,020
without labeling it as such, was key to art

146
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,460
and one of the classic articles,

147
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,260
So one of the first articles there is

148
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,180
the article from 1973, which is a title

149
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,620
"Informal Income Opportunities and Urban Employment

150
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,740
in Ghana."

151
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,140
The article is such that the case

152
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,940
that he is such is less relevant than the understanding

153
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,740
as to what he coined to this article,

154
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,060
or how this has shaped, let's say, subsequent debates.

155
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,180
So hard primarily focused on a number of things.

156
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,780
He focused on actual employment,

157
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,860
so people making a living beyond government jobs,

158
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,060
beyond factories and beyond large scale companies.

159
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,300
You know, say, okay, there's a whole world out there

160
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,100
of how people make a living, especially in Ghana,

161
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,820
but he then sort of extrapolated this

162
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,860
to urban Africa at large.

163
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,460
Say, okay, there's a whole world out there of work

164
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,580
that we actually don't see.

165
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,500
We don't capture it.

166
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,820
We don't see it because we don't have to vocabulary

167
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,180
to really pay attention to it.

168
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,340
So that's the first observation he makes there.

169
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,740
He then makes it, he bases this on a distinction

170
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,260
to informal and formal labor.

171
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,160
It says, well, all vocabulary that we have

172
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,960
is largely catering to, especially for economics,

173
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,020
to capturing, registering, and registering,

174
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,420
and measuring formal labor.

175
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,780
So labor that actually shows up in GDP,

176
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,940
values, et cetera.

177
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,620
Labor that is actually taxed.

178
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,220
And a lot of the labor that we see in our Africa,

179
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,900
you argue it's not taxed as such,

180
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,500
or we don't see it for that reason.

181
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,300
So he introduced this distinction

182
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,180
informal labor, formal economy, formal employment,

183
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,460
and informal employment.

184
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,660
He also then makes a distinction between illegitimate

185
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,300
and legitimate labor where he said, okay,

186
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,980
the jitterments activity, which is not the same

187
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,020
as informal and formal.

188
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,140
He says, okay, we can't have informal activity according

189
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,060
to him, so economically, which is not measured as such,

190
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,180
which is still the jitterments, which he then argues

191
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,540
those are activities that do actually make a contribution

192
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:25,500
economic growth but at a small scale. So if you let's say sell foods on on a local market but

193
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,380
this is not captured you're not registered as an official business this according to them is

194
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:37,180
legitimate in formal activity which I think most of us can actually agree with. And then there's

195
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,620
illegitimate informal activity where it says well that can refer to criminal activities but also

196
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,900
to for example to bagging or bribery or corruption, which you consider to be illegitimate.

197
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:54,580
So there's a kind of four-fold distinction which is really shaped the thing to debate.

198
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,700
And you can question and disagree with some of the specifics of his argument, but the

199
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,420
way he structured his idea has been quite important.

200
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,740
Now, I mentioned this here not because I want to discuss with you Urban Africa or 1973

201
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,100
a key thought, but because I think some of the classical landmarks studies that he and others

202
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,980
have done in the early 1970s have informed the debates that followed elsewhere. Inframality

203
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,300
is an interesting concept because it's one of the few concepts you could argue that has

204
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,140
really seen a concept from the global south to the global north. So where most of us are

205
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,100
very well aware of critiques toward, let's say, urban studies saying, well, it's actually

206
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,020
Eurocentric or at least Western centric. Inframality is one of those concepts which you

207
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,620
you could say, "Start it in the global south,"

208
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,420
and actually has been picked up increasingly

209
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,300
in order to understand also practices

210
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,740
within the global north.

211
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,020
To such an extent, I would argue that it's one of the few

212
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,860
concepts which really transcends this kind of global south

213
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,700
global law divide and really sort of contributes to

214
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,340
thinking in terms of a global urban studies.

215
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,220
So if you look at work, for example, of Ananya Roy,

216
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,740
or Jennifer Robinson, they have picked up

217
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,460
on the informality topic as a way of also thinking about

218
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,100
urban studies in more global terms

219
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,260
without being, let's say, Eurocentric or Western century.

220
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,100
They're all kinds of related terms,

221
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,460
and they all have to do, let's say,

222
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,020
this monetary specifics,

223
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,860
that are pretty much trying to cover the same field,

224
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,820
but I won't discuss here,

225
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
such as unregistered economy, black markets,

226
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,180
the non-observe economy,

227
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,860
undeclared work, or the shadow or hidden economy.

228
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,900
And for those, let's say, more trade and feminist theory,

229
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,180
it's quite obvious, let's say,

230
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,380
that the distinction to informal and formal

231
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,020
Washington also maps onto the distinction

232
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,820
between public and private, with public activities,

233
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,100
often being seen as part of the form of an economy,

234
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,700
but let's say private activities such as care work,

235
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,380
being seen as the informal economy,

236
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,820
often also not measured,

237
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,140
and thus supposedly not worthy of attention.

238
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,860
And of course, this has overlapped

239
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,460
and been involved in rethinking the terms of that debate

240
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,020
to an important extent also.

241
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,900
So in urban anthropology,

242
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,660
thinking about informality, you get the research on the opportunities but also

243
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,860
precarries created by unregulated economic activities. I will give some examples later,

244
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,300
but it's quite obvious for example if we fast forward, let's say, to research on

245
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,700
creating cultural industries, and research that has now been done on precarious

246
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,780
precarious artistic labor, for example. It struggles with a similar tension, where

247
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,420
the to a large extent artistic labor is also unregulated, which creates all kinds of

248
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,300
freedoms and opportunities, but at the same time this let's say this unregulated nature,

249
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,340
which makes it very precarious because there's no way you can actually support, well,

250
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,020
let's say where a state or a welfare state of other mechanisms can actually structure

251
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,820
the kind of economic activities.

252
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,560
Urban anthropology and historically speaking has also seen a strong interest in the

253
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
gender dimensions.

254
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,820
Of informal works, I've already hinted at this.

255
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,020
Partially in the home situation, partially in mostly females being women working on markets,

256
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:07,020
etc. So all kinds of gender in the exclusions that are part of this discussion. And again,

257
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:12,860
they have shaped the debates in the decades that followed. Also important things that

258
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,980
urban anthropology we see in formality being linked strongly to transnational dimensions.

259
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,980
So with the idea that informal labor market informal urban labor markets are often also

260
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:30,460
highly transnational labor markets. On one level with diaspora connections, people sending back

261
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:40,460
they are there earnings or part of their earnings to their home country, but also with many migrants actually occupying informal labor markets in in countries in cities across the world.

262
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:55,460
So there's the transnational connection which urban anthropology certainly was among the first to pay attention to, which I see an increasing amount of research in in urban and interdisciplinary urban studies.

263
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:01,220
example of the Montevos and Barcelona, for example, who often have an African background and who have

264
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,540
would live in relative, if you precarious situations, well, very precarious situations in Spain,

265
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,780
being sort of legal, illegal, semi-legal in different kinds of statuses and trying to make a living

266
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,260
in this case, Barcelona.

267
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:24,020
So that's a five-minute summary of a 40-year debate in urban anthropology. So apologies for any

268
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,180
of lack of solities, but my discussion is relatively instrumental here, and that I want to get across them.

269
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:37,380
The key, let's say conceptual elements, conceptual nuggets, you could say, that that's also

270
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,860
shaped a bit in interdisciplinary urban studies. A second term that I'm sure you've come across

271
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:52,100
before in your reading is everyday life. Now, both anthropology, but especially in cultural studies,

272
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,180
This notion of everyday life really shifted the bait and signifies in many ways

273
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,660
it concerned with the lift experiences and meanings constructed by subjects in their own world.

274
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:10,100
Partially emerging you could save in the 1970s as a chronic critique of supposedly structuralism

275
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:16,580
Marxist theory being more attention to agency so it's part of that 1970s 1980s debate but then also

276
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,620
increasingly moving into a let's say substantive empirical research where research started

277
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:30,660
being attached to the actual lift experiences and meanings of people. So people's active creative

278
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,180
agents rather than as passive consumers, this is kind of what sort of the broads into disciplinary

279
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:43,700
sprawling debate of everyday life signifies. Now there are many connections there I think within

280
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,540
different disciplines that have in one way or another tried to engage with everyday life with

281
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:53,120
or without using the concept, one which I will only hint at, I think here, but which might

282
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,480
be discussed in some more detail by those that follow, not everyone does, but depending

283
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,960
on your program, those that follow urban sociology of Ava Swindeau, there's a kind of

284
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,600
tradition of community studies in anthropology and cultural studies, which historically

285
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,200
has focused on participant observation and extensive theories of field work to really

286
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,360
gain trust and insight knowledge of everyday practices.

287
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,760
So basically an anthropological stance, you could say,

288
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,560
you become part of a community.

289
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,520
And only through this insight knowledge,

290
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,400
you will actually understand the meanings

291
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,920
and interpretations attached to certain practices.

292
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,840
It of course also has a history going back

293
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,520
to the Chicago School with research

294
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,040
on also ethnographic research on urban areas

295
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,320
and various, let's say, urban topics,

296
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,520
such as gangs, I think segregation, lifestyle,

297
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,440
delinquency.

298
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,160
But there's also a rule connection

299
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,960
where a special within our associateiology,

300
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,320
let's say partially in parallel to the Chicago school,

301
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,000
which was always more urban in orientation,

302
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,640
where some classic community studies,

303
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,360
especially in the 1950s and 1960s,

304
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,840
sort of started applying, you could say rural concepts

305
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,760
of classic community studies to urban settings.

306
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,440
So going into a supposed community and a setting

307
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,640
and then focusing on, let's say,

308
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,120
family and kinship relations

309
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,480
or traditions or rituals.

310
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,240
This kind of community studies that a literature has been quite heavily criticized over

311
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,720
the years, largely for being too localist or for assuming community as relative homogenous,

312
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,520
which was already problematic, you would say in a rural setting, but certainly it's problematic

313
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,440
and it's much more dynamic than dynamic urban settings.

314
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,840
It's the idea that communities actually share same values was increasingly questioned.

315
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,120
Because the tradition there often, let's say, focusing on everyday life of these communities

316
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,040
was already established by this kind of, this kind of minutured.

317
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,160
There is somebody waiting in their reading.

318
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:54,080
Let's see, because every time when I have to, but I might be able to do it like this.

319
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,480
Nope, we're already in the process of this area.

320
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Okay.

321
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,160
more. But I can do this all the time because it's quite interrupting so that I'll now start again.

322
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:13,000
You can still see me. Perfect, now I'll continue.

323
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,840
So especially from the 1980s onwards, I think we've seen a revival of the community studies

324
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,000
that moved beyond the kind of nostalgic motion of community. And this is where, so to

325
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:34,960
So again, the everyday life notions, well, returns in a way or becomes more present in

326
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,360
theorizing urban communities.

327
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,760
Some basic trends, and again, I just mentioned them here, but I think they basically

328
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,480
still structured a bit up to this day is that artists started using conflict theoretical

329
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,160
approach instead of collision theoretical approaches.

330
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,760
So looking at, let's say, interactions, obviously social interactions between actors, between

331
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,840
people, but also not sort of assuming, let's say, cohesion theoretically.

332
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,680
But assuming, let's say conflict theoretically, we could say very bluntly speaking, you

333
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,040
could say, instead moving from a dual-kymion perspective to a Marxist perspective.

334
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,680
That's very simplistic, but basically that's what covers to a certain extent the debates.

335
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,580
folks on network ties, local and trans local, I already mentioned this whenever I'm

336
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,800
anthropology, care and support and unequal and changing nervous settings.

337
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,240
And because of the, let's say the interest in, let's say, conflicts and how communities

338
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,160
are constructed, not how we, let's say, are assumed to be, there was increasing interest

339
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,440
to let's say the shifting symbolic boundaries between communities.

340
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,520
So they're sort of the making connection, but also making distinctions between, between

341
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,920
communities and between groups.

342
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,000
And then of course that opens up, let's say, the base

343
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,360
to not just communities as, let's say,

344
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,200
and uply, all the facts of social life,

345
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,760
but more into the base around communities of choice

346
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,080
and elected belonging.

347
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,680
So they can move into sub-cultures or LGBTQI communities,

348
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,560
but also gated communities, for example,

349
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,560
in urban settings, where people choose to belong

350
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
to a very separate community.

351
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,480
Now, the everyday is really a striking concept,

352
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,320
and let's say in the career of this concept,

353
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,200
because it's a truly transdisciplinary concept,

354
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,500
perhaps even more so than the informal informality.

355
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,740
Truly transdisciplinary,

356
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,240
maybe with a strong humanity background,

357
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,940
but really connecting cultural theory

358
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,500
with philosophy with Marxism,

359
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,640
with ethnography, with poststructuralism,

360
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,280
with sociology and with aesthetics.

361
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,520
That's precisely what makes this concept

362
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,880
that things so interesting,

363
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,440
was to influence you for research and our recalters.

364
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,520
Now you have to be careful here,

365
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,240
because the simple fact that a concept is used

366
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,160
all these different, let's say, traditions or disciplines, doesn't mean, of course, that

367
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,960
is used in the same way. So if you look, for example, that's, and there's no time to discuss

368
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,560
this here, but if you look, for example, that every day life in, in, let's say, ethnography,

369
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,200
it's quite different than every day life in aesthetics, and quite different than every day life,

370
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,120
let's say, in more post post structural literary theory. Yeah. So you have to be quite careful there.

371
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,000
But for every study is, I would argue, there are a number of approaches, which have really

372
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,160
let's say eternal references in a way, those artists that are continuously referenced.

373
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,640
One is the unavoidable home dealer, Fayetteville. Everyone references home dealer Fayetteville.

374
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,240
We see every day as a side of utopian possibility, but in line with, let's say, its Marxist

375
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,440
credentials also sees the everyday as colonized by the commodity form. So commodification,

376
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,920
logic, also shaping the everyday. That has been, of course, very influential thing.

377
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,920
in our studies to a large extent also because it's pretty compatible with the critical political

378
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,440
economic or studies approach. So people can claim or can become more interested in culture,

379
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,200
but don't actually don't have to leave. Let's say the house of political economy too far.

380
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,240
They can stay pretty close to that kind of debate. But I would also pay attention to other

381
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,480
moral, let's say perhaps empirically minded research, although still very theoretical,

382
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,360
and I will only mention two here, which have been equally at least influential, I think,

383
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:21,880
in urban studies. One being, the work by Stuart Hall, who is a massive towering figure, I think,

384
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,640
within cultural studies, British cultural studies at least, who looks at the everyday life,

385
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,560
largely true, you could see, especially in this book here, which is an additive book and a

386
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:38,840
compilation of classic classic papers of the British cultural studies center at that point in time,

387
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,880
the two looks at it to the subculture lens.

388
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,800
And the notion of subculture was coined

389
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,520
by British cultural studies.

390
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,920
And even though subculture is also word,

391
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,560
we tend not to use anymore.

392
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,920
Many of the, let's say, practices that we assumed

393
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,360
to shape subcultures are with us today.

394
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
So we might not name them subcultures anymore.

395
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,120
We might talk about the machines or about the networks

396
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,840
or something along those lines.

397
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,720
But the idea that subcultures are, let's say,

398
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,240
every day, but also are also kind of symbolic opposition

399
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,720
to a dominant social order.

400
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,360
This idea that they are one way or another resistance

401
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,200
is very influential, I think.

402
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,240
So if you look at the literature on, let's say,

403
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,200
subcultures, or let's say, neural literature

404
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,600
on protests, movements, or let's say clubbing culture,

405
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,720
it still uses these kinds of discounting for cavalry.

406
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
So that then directs attention,

407
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
to urban practices of resistance, but also style of fashion, of social practices,

408
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
or the particular codes that are used within a community,

409
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
added direct citation, I think also to a particular, let's say, generational category, namely urban youth.

410
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Which I think was really, has always been a recent in a way,

411
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
but British cultural studies tradition has perhaps directed most of his attention

412
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
to, let's say, this particular category of this particular generational layer.

413
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:12,200
layer. Typical of ever also for British cultural studies at that one in time is a certain

414
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,800
gender blindness. If you look at, let's say the early cultural studies tradition, those that

415
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,760
did research on subcultures, by and large looked at used cultures as you could say, boyish,

416
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,280
masculine used cultures. So there's certainly a certain gender blindness in the kind of

417
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,320
resistant use cultural literature.

418
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,280
However, this has increasingly been addressed

419
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,740
in subsequent work, partially and bachu

420
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,440
this kind of collup cultures literature that I mentioned.

421
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,840
Also by the work of artists such as Angela Megrob

422
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,480
who was part of the Early British Cultural Studies Foundation

423
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,200
and is now a professor at Goldsmith's College

424
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,160
and who has really addressed this kind of literature

425
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,120
and this kind of gender dimension of cultural studies.

426
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,080
Another order, and this is only a book I can,

427
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,920
Well, the other book also, but I certainly recommend you

428
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,840
to read this book if only because it's a very pleasant read.

429
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,440
It's beautifully written.

430
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,600
And it's not a tick book.

431
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,840
I think it has around 200 pages max I think.

432
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,040
It's pretty readable.

433
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,080
It's Michel de Sato and it's--

434
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,680
and it's--

435
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,320
he's written many things on a really live,

436
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,560
but this perhaps the most heavily silent book,

437
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,840
the practice of everyday life of 1984.

438
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,520
The-- having said the term, the English translations

439
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,320
from 1984 if I'm not mistaken.

440
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,080
It might be later that the original Franget is actually

441
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,120
from that time.

442
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,080
I will even look it up.

443
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,400
I forgot.

444
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,520
It's beautifully written.

445
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,120
It's perhaps more poetic, I would say, and less political

446
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,480
than British cultural studies, or at least less

447
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,720
in your face political.

448
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,640
But it has a vocabulary, I think, that has been very influential.

449
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,480
According to the Satoru, society is largely shaped,

450
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,640
and I think the binary nature of it,

451
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,280
the way you phrase it has been criticized,

452
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,880
but still it has been very influential,

453
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,600
but according to the society's largely shaped

454
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,120
by tactics versus strategies,

455
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,880
or strategies for some tactics in that order perhaps,

456
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,960
with a kind of state by a large use French, right?

457
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,640
So the city puts the state very central,

458
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,320
perhaps even more so that the economy

459
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,080
devices all kinds of let's say strategy structures

460
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,080
or does of social life,

461
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,600
against which we assistance as groups,

462
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,080
although you have a relatively individual focus,

463
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,480
devise all kinds of tactics in order to resist,

464
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,240
to avoid, to intervene,

465
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,400
so all kind of creative ways of dealing with strategies,

466
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,960
and sort of turning it around

467
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,800
and doing something else with it.

468
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,840
This is the kind of literature, which, as I said,

469
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,120
the binary nature of it,

470
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,680
that this idea that there is such a thing as strategies,

471
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,760
Let's say top down strategies versus bottom up tactics

472
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
because that's the kind of image you see.

473
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,440
It's problematic, it's too simplistic, I think.

474
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,640
But it has very much shaped this idea

475
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,640
that we have, let's say, media, cultures, shaping,

476
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,920
shaping things, but we are also creative consumers,

477
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,000
we can actually change and creatively interpret things.

478
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,960
Does a tool gives a very urban angle to this?

479
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,200
It really talks a lot about, let's say,

480
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,960
walking in the city, for example.

481
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,080
some of the walking literature and walking.

482
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,120
There's a door, it's one of the key artists there.

483
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
And it really looks at the key.

484
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,200
Obviously, there's a city which has been designed

485
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
and structured and constructed in a certain way.

486
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,960
But we as citizens, we can walk in the city

487
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,960
and sort of adapt and use a different line,

488
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,520
a route of walking, et cetera,

489
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,080
and ways not intended by the designers.

490
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,640
So it is then leads to a kind of literature

491
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,800
and kind of reader reading,

492
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,160
which looks at tactics,

493
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
everyday practices, I would say,

494
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,280
practices of everyday life as situated, it's often very local, sometimes as defensive in defense,

495
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:01,520
yeah, in defense too, but also sometimes opportunistic. You sort of pick up on some structured

496
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,080
elements and do something else with it. So that's the kind of literature and especially kind of

497
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,160
vocabulary, which again has shaped a lot of things, this idea of, of, of, I shaped a lot of research

498
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,720
on every day of life.

499
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Okay.

500
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
That's my first part.

501
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,260
I will just go to Quick Loop, but I see no one entering anymore because now I have pretty

502
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,720
much all chat box, not a box is open.

503
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,520
Are there any questions on this first part as a kind of first go on?

504
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:42,040
I see a question from Vera as James Scott, can you maybe explain this very critical

505
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:48,760
brief question. I don't see you so you're going to have to sort of speak up.

506
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:56,360
Now I was just thinking about the work of the de-structure, mission de-structure,

507
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,840
that you mentioned. And actually also James Cotely is from the same period. He published

508
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:08,520
the everyday life experiences of the pleasant etc. This talk about this

509
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,680
in for politics and matters stuff.

510
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,040
- Absolutely, no, it's very much part of the same reasoning.

511
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,400
So one of the other books that I could have mentioned

512
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,920
perhaps, but it has been less influential

513
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,600
in urban studies, but there's a great book

514
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,360
by James Scott also seeing like the state,

515
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,120
which is basically this kind of logic.

516
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,960
It's the kind of seeing like a state you could replace

517
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,800
that with the de Satoru vocabulary of strategies.

518
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,140
and then you have citizens, people, communities,

519
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,440
these perhaps more community oriented there,

520
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,660
partially shaped I think by the

521
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,240
anthropological background,

522
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,920
which is, which divides all kinds of tactics

523
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,000
as ways of resistance.

524
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,120
Not absolutely, it's that kind of debate.

525
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,800
Yeah, good question.

526
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,160
Any other questions on this first point?

527
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,880
If so, just speak up because that's easier for me

528
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,240
than go through the whole list of people.

529
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,240
No.

530
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Okay.

531
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Then I'll continue with the second part.

532
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Well, yep, indeed.

533
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,240
So a couple of lines of research that I'll say more contemporary.

534
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,240
So, current lines of research within urban studies that focus on urban culture.

535
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Within interdisciplinary urban studies, I think here we definitely move beyond the realm of urban geography,

536
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,800
geography narrowly defined.

537
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,200
And I want to discuss with you today.

538
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
The reason why I spend a fair amount of attention

539
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,080
to the previous art, to the previous debates,

540
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,680
is also because as you will see in the discussion

541
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,680
that now follows, is that the kind of vocabulary that these

542
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,600
kinds of debates use are very still influenced,

543
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,880
knowingly or unknowingly, unknowingly,

544
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,800
so by the previous discussions.

545
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,280
So by both issues on the symbolic economy,

546
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,200
postmodern urbanism, informality in everyday life.

547
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
So that really still shapes, I think,

548
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,760
some of these current debates.

549
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,480
I will now discuss all possible directions

550
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,120
in this area of studies on urban culture.

551
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,560
If only because culture is such a, let's say,

552
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,840
slippery concept and research has really explored

553
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,240
in all kinds of directions and as let's all kinds,

554
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,520
we could say sub-disciplines,

555
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,480
or let's say certain strands of research

556
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,480
that that would be impossible to do in a two hour lecture.

557
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,420
So I've been quite, let's say,

558
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,480
so lactate in a selection has been purely based

559
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,520
on my own preferences in a sense

560
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,080
that I'm going to discuss with you

561
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,640
the number of strands of research

562
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,120
that I consider to be interesting

563
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,440
or the most interesting strands of research.

564
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,360
Obviously, I also consider to be these

565
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,000
the more to be the more productive strands of research

566
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,920
and a lot of research is being done in this kind of field.

567
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,840
The first strand of research

568
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,800
to discuss with you and again a little pause at the end of this trend is around the arts,

569
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,440
activism and urban engagement. Research on the arts, of course, there's an established tradition,

570
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,320
obviously primarily in the humanities of aesthetic analysis of the arts. So of painting, of music,

571
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:20,160
of theatre, mostly actually, and increasingly so differentiating into different disciplines.

572
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,280
to your left musicology, you will have tiered studies, you will have a

573
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,520
let's see art history or visual studies and those are established

574
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,720
traditions off the web histories reaching back on the years.

575
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,080
Yeah, urban studies that even as an interdisciplinary field builds on these

576
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,120
traditions but actually it's primarily used as sociological and

577
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,240
or politically economic approach towards the arts and culture.

578
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,920
So some of the elements I will discuss here, they certainly do not capture the

579
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,360
diverse, the offer, let's say research on the arts that is out there. But they do pretty

580
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,920
much capture, I think, what's out there within nervous studies. So the more social scientific

581
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,880
approach towards the arts obviously shapes the kinds of questions being asked. So one

582
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,080
result of this is that we also see through the critical focus on, let's say, the political

583
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,480
economy of the arts, we also see it in many, well, with many

584
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,520
odds, that many in many publications, an interest in the political or

585
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,000
critical potential and practice of the arts.

586
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,040
Yeah?

587
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,120
This is partially also a response to, and doesn't something I will not

588
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,960
discuss in detail here, to a relatively dominant debate on the creative

589
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,080
and cultural industries, which has really shaped the think that the

590
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,040
debate on the arts in the last 20 years, this idea that creative and

591
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,000
cultural industries contribute to, to let's see our, our contemporary knowledge economy that

592
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,200
they are a key economic sectors in, in our, in our current cities. And thus we're the strong focus on

593
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,480
economic dimensions of culture. This interest, you could say the political potential, the critical

594
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,280
potential of the arts is also partially a response to this. There are longer traditions, I will discuss

595
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,600
some of them, but this is a way of also trying to look at the creative industries the big

596
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:10,360
critically say okay well actually we miss out on a lot when we do not address the let's say the

597
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:17,400
resistant dimensions of the arts. Now the dream well there are many of course but I'm

598
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,680
summarised in here as three main lines of every research on the arts and I will discuss them

599
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,960
briefly in turn. One perhaps the most established line of research also because it ties in I think

600
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:38,360
with a history of research in, well, in our theory, basically, and in our history.

601
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,320
There's research on public arts and/or site-specific arts, the terms overlap.

602
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,360
A second line of research is research on artists and urban social movements,

603
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,200
the relation between artistic practice and urban social movements, and of course,

604
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,360
social movements, being established to bait within urban studies also.

605
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,240
And a third literature is literature,

606
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,040
this perhaps the most cultural studies oriented literature,

607
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,240
is literature on popular culture at urban politics.

608
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,000
So it's literature that that's increasingly engaged with,

609
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,280
with Lacy also theoretical,

610
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,440
philosophical literature on the political,

611
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,920
and how public culture plays a role in relation to urban political questions.

612
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,040
And I will discuss, of course, what I mean with the political here,

613
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,080
because it's not institutional politics per se, or if at all.

614
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:39,680
Now, the first line of research within this section is public art or site specific art.

615
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:46,540
For your readings, I added an admittedly relatively long chapter by Rosalindoyce, a New York

616
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,320
theorist or apologies for the length of the chapter.

617
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,840
But I included it because it's, well, for two reasons.

618
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:00,080
goes in the knowledge is a key art theorist, key cultural theorists who very early on I think

619
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:06,880
understood the productive connections between art theory and urban studies or geography,

620
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:15,120
critical geography. And erodes in the 1980s and 1990s a few foundational papers on the arts and

621
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:22,240
the urban. The paper here is called uneven development, public art in New York City. And basically

622
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,720
covers, I could say, a history of dealing with or engaging with public art in New York City

623
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,880
both by let's say local governments, local, the real estate developers, or let's say project

624
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:42,640
developers and artistic communities. I could have chosen other articles, the many other articles

625
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,480
possible. In the same book by the way, and I think I included the full book. There's also a great

626
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,040
critique the feminist critique of of Jameson and Harvey by way. I think the the chapter is called

627
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,240
Men in Space if I'm not mistaken. So basically she devices that you develop as a feminist ethnographic

628
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,240
critique of Jameson and Harvey. So I could definitely advise you to read this also. But in this

629
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,880
particular paper she basically develops a critique of the intimate utilization of public art.

630
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,680
So an emotion of the public by local governments and developers. So this idea that public

631
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,760
the way it's presented or used by local governments and developers,

632
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,920
since if it goes working more on planning,

633
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,160
in many countries you will have, if you have a kind of building scheme

634
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,360
or a local planning project,

635
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,960
a certain percentage of the budget needs to be spent on public art.

636
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,240
Now, for those who notice in most cases,

637
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,320
there is rarely a lead, in many cases,

638
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,640
there is a lot of, in most cases,

639
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,080
this does not lead to very interesting types of art.

640
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,480
It's a kind of tick the box, exercise,

641
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,240
in some cases, of course it does.

642
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,240
So she develops the critique of how public art

643
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,680
is instrumentalized in order to further,

644
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,640
you could say, the uneven development of New York City.

645
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,160
So it's shaped by elite concerns

646
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,400
and shaped by politically economic concerns.

647
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,760
So public art becomes a kind of legitimation device

648
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,120
for uneven development.

649
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,120
You should briefly refer,

650
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,040
as I mentioned here,

651
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,080
because I like the term pseudo-polar public sphere,

652
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,060
which is a critique of Alexander Klug and Anatyiris

653
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,960
on this idea of how a massian kind of ideal public sphere

654
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,600
as a field of deliberation.

655
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,800
I said, well, actually there's very little actual dialogue

656
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,120
taking place.

657
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,520
But she also hints at him.

658
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,840
This is something that, for example, Nancy Fraser

659
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,400
and other theorists later also developed

660
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
in more detail, perhaps, to this idea

661
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,040
of the emergent oppositional public spheres.

662
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,440
Yes, there is uneven development,

663
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,480
but it kind of sued a public sphere.

664
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,900
But we also see kind of oppositional public spheres emerging.

665
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,080
Public spheres, which on top of that,

666
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,880
have a heavy emphasis on, let's say, cultural and aesthetic dimensions.

667
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,440
So basically, often artistic communities

668
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,760
that are related to actors being engaged

669
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,000
in the design of oppositional public spheres.

670
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,400
And again, of course, this especially

671
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,000
for those interested in the arts,

672
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
has been a massive influence

673
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,600
in thinking to what kind of role can the arts play

674
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,640
in the urban and in urban development that much.

675
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:21,640
Now, here's a nice quote, a thing by adoration that summarizes, basically, this kind of

676
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,680
idea and the critique also.

677
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,760
So the idea that art cannot assume the existence of a public, but must help produce one,

678
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,640
and that the public sphere is less a physical space than a social, nullify to consider

679
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,360
a considerable extent, except that the vision is being public and non-public art.

680
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,520
potentially any exhibition venue is a public sphere

681
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,720
and conversely the location of artworks

682
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,800
outside privately owned galleries,

683
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,320
in parks and plazas,

684
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,400
were simply outdoors,

685
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,520
hardly guarantees that they will address the public.

686
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
Now, I'm sure that the discord prep needs

687
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,200
a bit of unpacking, right?

688
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,240
But basically what you're trying to get at here

689
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,080
is in the first sentence,

690
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,440
is that we cannot assume that by simply let's say

691
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,720
putting public art on a public square, for example,

692
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,240
We cannot assume that we automatically address the public.

693
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,760
People just don't mind not engaged with it.

694
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,560
People just that might just be there,

695
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,200
but that doesn't really make a public.

696
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,520
We can only make a public if it actually actively

697
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,240
engage with people.

698
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,360
So you actually have to construct a public.

699
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,760
And this is more than what most public arts,

700
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,440
supposedly public art achieves.

701
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,360
So this is the first question,

702
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,040
the question even the first critique she has. The second line is okay we this

703
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,160
actually leads if you think through the logical conclusions of this it means

704
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:53,320
that it simply putting arts in the out in the open doesn't make public art

705
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,480
but it also means that for example you can have public arts in a gallery

706
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,980
as long as you engage with the public this obviously would constitute public

707
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:09,660
So she critiques this distinction within much of our theory of that time that relied on this idea that

708
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:16,060
a critique of, let's say, modern art is that you move out of the gallery and into the public.

709
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,620
She says, "Well, actually, yes, that's a good idea, but it doesn't really make for public art per se."

710
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:26,220
So this is basically the kind of, let's say, dichotomy she's playing with and that are important.

711
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,220
I think to keep in mind.

712
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:36,220
Sure, some of the most important thing is to keep in mind to the start that we have in our

713
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:42,220
objects, but this art object needs actual engagement with an audience, with the public,

714
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:51,220
in order to become public. That's important to keep in mind here.

715
00:44:51,220 --> 00:45:01,940
bit more concrete she has one very famous example by an equally famous artist, although not at

716
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:07,220
the time, I think he was still relatively young in his career at that point in time, which is

717
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:16,340
Richard Serra's tilted arc. This example is also discussed in the paper by Doytchen. Now, as you can

718
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:23,260
see on the image here, this is quite obviously an intervention in public space, right?

719
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,740
It's a massive piece of work.

720
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:32,500
It's a 37 meter long and 3.7 meter tall steel plates on fully square, which is in lower Manhattan,

721
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,660
New York.

722
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,660
Yeah?

723
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:41,940
So if anything, this is a kind of public artwork that you cannot ignore, obviously.

724
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:50,680
The way this according to Deutsche, the way this artwork has been sort of, let's say,

725
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,380
interpreted or let's say received, it really shows some of the problems of public art as

726
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,820
she made as she sees it.

727
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,620
Some of you could say some of the more conservative voices or sort of use of the public

728
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:09,380
space, have me criticize this piece of art because it blocks their way of passage, obviously,

729
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:16,900
If you look at the image, it completely makes impossible the usage of the public square

730
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:23,780
by, let's say, workers working moving from one building to the next.

731
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:28,260
At the same time, Deutsche Argyz, well, this doesn't necessarily make it public arts,

732
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,380
and some of the exaggerating claims made by critical, let's say, defenders of this piece

733
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,860
of work.

734
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:39,580
They have really focused, you could say, on assumptions as the shifts in behavior of

735
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,900
the supposed juices of this space.

736
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,220
So without actually talking to people, without actually engaging with their own interests,

737
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,780
they have assumed that the very fact that people have to sort of re-articulate their, let's

738
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,740
say, everyday practices, that they're led to a more aesthetic engagement with the public

739
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,740
space.

740
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:03,540
Now, according to Doris, the main problem of the discourse around this piece of art, as

741
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,620
lot of the piece of art itself, this that it relied on a very narrow aesthetic

742
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,420
reading, so ignoring actual uses of urban space to very generic

743
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,860
claims on a static uses of the square. So actually it's a kind of public art

744
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,740
intervention, which refuses to be public because it doesn't engage any sense

745
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,420
with the public. So this idea that the public involves a dialogue

746
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,580
is completely ignored in this sense. It's basically an ultimately

747
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:39,580
strong artist figure putting an art piece in the public square without actually becoming part and engaging with the public.

748
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:47,580
This piece was also removed in 1989 after years of critique but as perhaps a side note for the debate here.

749
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:59,580
The counter example perhaps the oppositional public sphere you can argue that the doji uses and I think this is a bit an artwork that has also been picked up by artists such as Neil Smith who also wrote a

750
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,740
to also roll a piece on this.

751
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:05,940
It's just of what just goes to homeless vehicle projects.

752
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,980
Also a public arts space,

753
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,740
but a different kind of animal.

754
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,980
So here in this case, a vehicle decided,

755
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,900
I had a lab by the way when looking at this picture

756
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,420
because I'm pretty sure it is the trunk tower in the back,

757
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,620
but that's something else,

758
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,580
which at that point, it's not that less of a,

759
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,500
less of symbolic value perhaps than it has now.

760
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,980
That's a different kind of animal.

761
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,420
It's also public art, also metal in many ways.

762
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,780
But here, it's a vehicle designed by artists,

763
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,700
by the artists, sorry, in singular,

764
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,140
in consultation with homeless people.

765
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,500
And it was seen in a different way.

766
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,620
It was seen as a practical tool

767
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,140
for managing everyday life of the homeless.

768
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,900
So in this thing, which you can't let the expand

769
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:53,100
when it's placed somewhere,

770
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,060
it was a space for washing, for sleeping,

771
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,860
but also for storage space, for example,

772
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,040
for collecting empty bottles or something.

773
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,500
So all this into one vehicle.

774
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,420
Vehicle, sorry.

775
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,140
This was both an exhibition object,

776
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,500
which was exhibited in USA Classic galleries,

777
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,900
as well as an object for actually making visible

778
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,340
the homeless in public space.

779
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,500
So I think on the basis of this example,

780
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,740
you already feel a bit,

781
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:23,740
the kind of different approach used towards the public

782
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,180
by this piece of work or by the previous piece,

783
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,340
by Richard Serra, because here there is an engagement

784
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,380
with specific urban users,

785
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,500
highly marginalized to use on top of this,

786
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,780
and thus, implicitly or explicitly,

787
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,140
a critique of uneven urban developments,

788
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,100
because it's a piece of work that is situated in public space

789
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,780
and makes visibly percadia effects of uneven urban developments

790
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,620
on a wider group of, let's say, urban users.

791
00:49:53,620 --> 00:50:08,620
Okay, maybe to wrap up here on this, on this first strand of research.

792
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:14,540
So these are all examples of site specific art that moved art beyond the exhibition space

793
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,540
into the urban.

794
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,540
So there was a thing within art theory and art history, kind of internal critique of the

795
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:25,820
art world. We have to move out of the museums, out of the galleries, but also a broadening

796
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:31,820
or as a result of that also, a broadening of a static debate to either social concerns.

797
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:38,620
So this then leads to notions such as going by critically, in this case, by a health foster such

798
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,660
that the artist has a nographer, which looks at the role of the artist in the collaborative process,

799
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,740
or the artist has a participant of the reserve, so the artist has an ethnographer.

800
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:54,380
So the critique of foster is also, and this has been picked up in later work also,

801
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,620
is that the globalization of art market, and this is where I say different disciplinary debates

802
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:03,500
also become interesting, that the globalization of the art market, there's something rarely addressed

803
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:08,140
sufficiently, I think in other studies, leads, for example, to commissioning of artists to produce

804
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:14,540
community-based site-specific artworks, however, without a clear knowledge of the local context.

805
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:21,740
So we see that by annual logic, for example, the art festival logic, where artists are flown into

806
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:26,380
particular sites in order to develop community-based work, but they are adding to the community.

807
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:34,300
So often these are, let's say, all you superficially speaking, public works of public art.

808
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:41,020
And again, so much of this was foreshadowed, I think, by the work of Dolce also, but of course,

809
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,020
those others at this point in time.

810
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:51,180
So that's the first strand of research.

811
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,940
The second strand of research is around

812
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,580
artisan's urban social movements.

813
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,580
And of course, I'm making analytical distinction here.

814
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,540
In practice, some of these debates go over lab

815
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,100
and there are interactions.

816
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,660
But for the purpose of discussion,

817
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,700
I think it's helpful to keep them a bit separate.

818
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,980
So the second strand of research

819
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,300
tries to look at artisan urban social movements.

820
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,300
So there's a long, standing tradition obviously

821
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,380
of artists engaging in social movements,

822
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,860
but mostly those have been a research

823
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,500
I would argue outside of urban studies.

824
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,020
Again, we didn't let's say the fields specific debates

825
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,940
such as theater or such as visual studies

826
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,180
et cetera art history.

827
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,780
Within urban studies, I think most of the recent debates

828
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,180
in this area has been the only critique

829
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,820
of the creative class and creative industries

830
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:43,540
policies as I've already hinted at, or perhaps neoliberal or entrepreneurial urbanism more widely.

831
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:50,020
So what kind of role you are to play in or part of urban social movements in critiquing,

832
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:58,020
you could say the neoliberalization of the urban. Now there's a nice paper actually by

833
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:04,340
a UNist Novi and Kleakkulon, who many of you have seen attended today, who wrote a nice paper

834
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:07,980
We're struggling for the right to the creative city in Berlin and Hamburg.

835
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:15,060
I really give a nice brief, brief, but nice overview, I think, of urban social movements.

836
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:19,940
So it's a kind of literature which I, well, we don't really discuss the thing at our

837
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:24,620
social geography, that's an important literature, which moves from the history of squatting

838
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:30,820
and demonstrations against a renewal politics to urban counterculture.

839
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:34,180
then zoom in on the role of artists and cultural workers in contesting

840
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:39,540
color-created class and creative industry's politics. Now there's a lot that can be said about

841
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,460
this but what is interesting here of course is that automatically debate becomes you could say

842
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,340
sociological or social scientific because the moment you start looking at artists within social

843
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,580
movements you can no longer look just at their aesthetic expressions but you automatically have to

844
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:58,100
look at what is practically speaking their role within an often quiet heterogenous diverse

845
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,500
composition of protest movements. So we see artists collaborating with diverse

846
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:08,280
set of actors and that of course shapes their artistic practice. The role of

847
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,500
artists here, at least this is what no being conno highlights, I like strongly

848
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,860
I think they are definitely onto something there, is that artists to some

849
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,180
extent have a privileged role or a particular role within the urban social

850
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:24,380
movements because they have access to an experience with media networks and

851
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:29,740
and the familiarity with communication techniques. So this then leads to a discussion around the role of

852
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:36,300
artists in how, let's say particular urban conflicts are framed and reframes by artists in often

853
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:45,500
visual or other ways. And many examples you can discuss here. This is one example discussed also in

854
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:51,260
the article of the "Media Spake" quote "test in Berlin". For those that know Berlin, you will know

855
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,820
probably also know sort of the history a bit of media. I will not discuss this here. It's a big

856
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:02,780
urban development area on let's say well there's a southern part of really signed northern part

857
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:09,900
of Keweisbach partially which really lets us look at the counter mobilization because there's

858
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:16,620
also the area which is let's say a concentration of artistic and and and leisure and

859
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,220
and clubbing activity.

860
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,620
So here's a one simple example where sort of artists

861
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,500
you could say have been involved in developing

862
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,100
different, let's say, visual aesthetics.

863
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,180
And it says this basically ironically

864
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,380
builds on the B-BERLIN branding scheme.

865
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,700
So those who don't know it, just Google it.

866
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,140
And it uses the same kind of design.

867
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,300
But then changes the kind of language.

868
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,860
And sort of ironically, so instead of being

869
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,860
being creative and being a foyer, but how to translate that.

870
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:50,860
If I can translate that, being used and thrown away.

871
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,860
So this is a lot of viable.

872
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,860
Yeah, commodifiable is perhaps the closest.

873
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,860
Thank you, very, very good point for me and Basas,

874
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,860
but you're right, commodifiable.

875
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,860
And they replaced it by Zizamesgrystim,

876
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,860
so I saw the Dari-Zizai-Rita-Stun, so it could be self.

877
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,860
Again, difficult to try itself.

878
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:18,500
So, independent something on those lines, we saw the solidarity and be resistance.

879
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,460
So stop gentrification.

880
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,740
So this is one example.

881
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:28,900
Other examples, of course, not discussing this particular article, but from other other

882
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:34,500
sites, of course, this kind of artistic, let's say framing, or political and urban conflicts

883
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,860
ties in with a much much longer history of art and protest.

884
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,820
Most obviously in street art as well as graphic design.

885
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:45,100
So a couple of examples that are, let's say, illustrative of this,

886
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,620
but certainly not exhaustive.

887
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:50,300
So on the top right, you see a performance protest of an extension,

888
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,100
extension rebellion, protest in London.

889
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,620
The middle left, I think, has been quite similar to most of you

890
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,140
who think the Black Lives Matter, painted street.

891
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,580
I think this one in the Washington DC.

892
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:10,380
or to the bottom right, claim state, well, if they're painting, stating the

893
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:15,340
low to the depth repayments, street arts, intervention, and Buenos Aires.

894
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:21,420
And I've could have used many, many other examples, but just to give a sense of

895
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,140
the rare sort of artist play a role in urban social movements or at least a

896
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:30,140
protest if it's less organized than a social movement.

897
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:34,940
And again, this has a much, much longer history going back many, many years.

898
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,780
Some would argue since the emerged of industrialization in many ways.

899
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:43,980
So the last,

900
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:52,380
the last rant within this section that I want to discuss with you

901
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,060
is public culture nerve and politics.

902
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,620
This is, last you could say, let's, around urban social movement,

903
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:05,980
it also lasts around the art world as such, but more about more broader cultural expressions.

904
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,980
So here we really go back to the classical core of cultural studies that it discussed before

905
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:16,540
with you. So here is a focus on popular culture as in everyday life, as questioning authority,

906
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:23,100
but also as imagining political alternatives. So the kind of language that we then use or see,

907
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:28,780
use and this kind of research is that it's about politics beyond governments and politicians

908
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,820
to become the street politics as a second by the ad call that's also kind of informalization.

909
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:38,780
This is where the informality that turns pops up again as you see. Informalization of the state

910
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:44,460
as for example Julia and Boudgo as called it. Nice book by the way.

911
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:52,100
Again, there are many, many examples here to discuss.

912
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,820
The classic case I would argue in this field of research,

913
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:59,340
it is hip hop or rap music more narrowly,

914
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,820
which has been studied by now, I think,

915
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,500
by multiple multiple disciplines,

916
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,460
range from musicology, cultural studies,

917
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,860
and anthropology, but also urban studies,

918
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,420
which traditionally has focused,

919
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,180
I think, strongly on a kind of classic cultural studies,

920
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,100
community orientation, urban localities,

921
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,820
So the hood, the ghetto as classic urban teams,

922
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,940
but we also are thinking in a more critical literature,

923
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,700
has paid attention to, let's say, the way

924
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,420
hip hop culture has become, let's say commodified

925
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:31,620
in its globalization of its cultural form.

926
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,860
But also how it has been picked up by people

927
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,580
from outside of, let's say, the US,

928
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:40,900
as supposedly the source of hip hop culture.

929
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,060
So that's the classic case.

930
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:47,420
libraries full of books by now I think on hip-hop. Some more interesting than others, this book by

931
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:53,340
Marie Forman is quite an interesting example though. Similar research has also been done

932
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:58,300
on other genres. Typically a lot of attention has been paid to music, we see it in other fields of

933
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,620
activity, also but music has received perhaps most attention and relation to popular culture and

934
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:07,340
the political. A range of from clubbing culture but also to opera although the political perhaps

935
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:12,700
less obviously there to punct to jazz to all kinds of other cultural expressions.

936
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:25,900
Now what all these strands amount to is that they point to different aesthetic strategies to

937
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:32,620
engage the urban. Yeah, and this is something that, well, has also increasingly received attention

938
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:38,620
in our studies. In an article about Timon Bayes, I put a reference at the bottom of the slides.

939
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:44,220
He points to a number of different aesthetic strategies. As I said, as I write here,

940
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:48,860
they are politically distinct, but in practice, of course, they are messier. Some,

941
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:54,620
some, let's say, aesthetic practices might be involved in a number of things at the same time.

942
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:59,500
Here we said, "Okay, we basically have spectacle, grassroots, social work,

943
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:06,140
are rising the senses and you can automatically see it to how so many examples I've shown before

944
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:10,700
can be one or more of these things. So let's say for example the Black Lives Matter,

945
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:17,820
let's say Banner on the street so to speak, in a way you could argue this is grassroots,

946
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:22,620
you could argue this is also social work, you could argue it's tough somehow it also arouses

947
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:27,220
the consensus because it's sometimes it questions the norms of what these

948
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,140
trees are for and questions differently say media representations but quite

949
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:36,220
obviously it's also a spectacle because it's a really sort of traveled

950
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:41,020
widely and can easily be used in kind of commodification strategy almost of

951
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:45,140
branding almost particular cities yeah so there are all kinds of different

952
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:49,140
dimensions and it's in a very good question ultimately to look at concrete

953
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:55,140
artistic practices to look at what the different dimensions, let's say the relation to each other is.

954
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:03,860
Okay, that's a long stretch for one slide, but it might also be one in the longer

955
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:10,740
longer discussions. I'll take a short break, near for questions. So please

956
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:17,380
just either type them in the chat or just start unmuting and speaking if there are any questions on

957
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:22,820
this section. Maybe it gives me a chance to do even more.

958
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:28,340
Wow, that was a pre-prepared question. That was a fast or

959
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:32,660
unless you type very fast. So Olica Aces a question

960
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:37,140
or a point. I want to raise attention to your related phenomenon, where an

961
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:41,060
artistic, creative approach is used in part

962
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:44,420
of a broader participatory and redevelopment strategy.

963
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,820
Here's some sort of institutionalizing of arts

964
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,420
and their movement is happening.

965
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,220
A small quirky teams of architects, planners, activists,

966
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,980
and artists are leading the process.

967
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,420
And sure, an example, AAF and then there's a website.

968
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,980
Maybe, Olic, you can--

969
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:01,100
so if I understand you correctly, we won't look at the example.

970
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:05,340
Now, then, it's your point being that artists

971
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,620
can actually become urban developers themselves.

972
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:12,260
Olic it.

973
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:17,820
I don't see you so you have to unmute the weekend.

974
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,620
Now I see you, but your muted.

975
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:20,140
All right.

976
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,220
Sorry.

977
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,140
Yeah.

978
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:22,780
Exactly.

979
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:27,500
Like artists are becoming part of the planning process

980
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:27,900
or more.

981
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:35,900
I think that the low threshold approach of artistic

982
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:40,180
experimental, like creativeness, as being employed

983
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:45,180
in order to justify maybe participatory processes

984
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:48,580
or lead to a more inclusion of people

985
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:52,820
or let them participate in the first place,

986
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:57,180
but also just to get the people on board

987
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,380
and create some sort of tolerance.

988
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,020
So this one would be like the creative,

989
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,380
what is it called?

990
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,300
The festival of creative urban living in Milton Keynes.

991
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,380
the UK, England.

992
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:19,140
So yeah, it sounds like coming from a very dry urban planning

993
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:19,900
background.

994
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,300
This is like a weird thing to do.

995
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,580
Because people who are attending this there

996
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,620
usually not aware of the broader scope

997
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,220
of this whole development that's happening to them.

998
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:34,900
So that's just interesting to also take a look at.

999
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,340
It's a good addition, something that I don't explicitly

1000
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:41,740
mentioned here, but it's a it's a neurology new trend I think, certainly something that we see

1001
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:46,700
more and more of. I mean it was there before, but that become more visible, I think in the last

1002
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:53,020
10 years. I would still argue though that the same kind of critical vocabulary already introduced

1003
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:57,500
by Deutsche is also necessary for these projects, because in some of these projects and initiatives

1004
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:04,860
at least we do see a relative instrumental or instrumentalization of artists. I.e. not the one artist is

1005
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,060
is not the other artists, right?

1006
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:10,120
So we see certain artists standing up

1007
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,180
as entrepreneurs, you could say,

1008
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,260
and becoming project developers

1009
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,900
in relatively uncritical ways.

1010
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,900
And I can name some examples also in Brussels

1011
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,380
where this is happening,

1012
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,820
which actually leads to a fair amount of critique

1013
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,580
also within your artistic community.

1014
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:32,220
- Yeah, and I wouldn't say that this is necessarily

1015
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,780
like a bad or a good thing.

1016
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:41,460
The teams that are involved are really good teams, but it's just like always look very critical

1017
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:48,340
because also the urban governments try sometimes to use this strategy and not in a very deceiving way.

1018
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:54,740
Yeah, okay, excellent. Thank you. I see another comment or comment literally by VIA. Please unmute.

1019
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:02,260
Yeah, but you already rise this critic from the Dosh, what is her name?

1020
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:09,060
Dosh, yeah. And is also the critic from Zurkin, like this tricky fact of the art,

1021
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:18,100
we also the vehicle of gentrification and stuff. So always super tricky to speak about the

1022
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:22,260
art and its puttain shaw in your run and space, let's say.

1023
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:27,060
but yeah absolutely so I'll give another example later on I think also which which raises this

1024
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:34,100
questions and the article I mentioned by sorry I can go back I can go back. About Timon Bass

1025
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:39,380
I also mentioned some of these ambivalences that are seemingly unavoidable so to speak there's

1026
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:43,620
no pure space in that sense. Okay excellent and then there's Max also has a comment.

1027
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:51,300
I just add on this point that Ulricha raised and a

1028
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:57,620
this theme of institutionalization and instrumentation of art and artists.

1029
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:02,340
I think Amsterdam is actually an interesting example because there is this

1030
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:06,020
municipal policy which could be translated as the

1031
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:12,580
breeding ground policy whereby the city assigns certain buildings as

1032
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:19,300
available for workshops and for artists to work there and often it's also very related to

1033
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:28,580
yeah strategy actually to gentrify a particular area I don't know whether there's any

1034
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:34,020
research done on this plus maybe you know. It has been definitely also by the Amsterdam

1035
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:37,940
College Law Service Strong Service Studies Research Edition at the University of Amsterdam but also

1036
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:40,460
others. No, no, that's been critical. We should be in

1037
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,540
none of it. And that one's just a particular case. It's an

1038
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,180
interesting case in any case because it's it's very

1039
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,940
elastic, advanced, professional and industrialization of

1040
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:52,460
the arts, the urban level. And the bootplasm, the breeding

1041
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:57,300
policy policy policy is yeah, it's it's striking in the way

1042
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,980
it's sort of well, use and test positive side effects also,

1043
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:05,140
but the way it little really uses the arts in in relative

1044
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:10,140
classical urban development strategies. That's definitely true. Yeah, not a research

1045
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:15,140
I've been known in that. Yeah. Okay, excellent. Thank you for the comments. They really

1046
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:22,140
add some very important additional thoughts here. Other points, if not, I continue with the

1047
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:31,140
third part of the presentation and that's the another section or direction of research on

1048
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:36,140
on the arts or on culture and the urban.

1049
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,540
This is what I would call,

1050
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,140
or this is basically my label,

1051
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,520
but I think it's what I would call

1052
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,780
research on cultural infrastructures and informal urbanism.

1053
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,740
So this is where the lesson in the literature on the informal

1054
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:49,020
actually starts broadening to, let's say,

1055
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,140
literature on informal urbanism,

1056
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,940
which might be a phrase that you've come across

1057
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:54,740
also a number of times.

1058
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,180
And this overlaps the thing in recent years

1059
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,660
where increasing attention has been paid

1060
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,580
to let's think the infrastructure dimension

1061
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:02,020
of urban cultures.

1062
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,640
Some scholars have already talked about

1063
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,860
an infrastructural term.

1064
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,820
I disliked talking about terms

1065
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:09,740
because it's very claiming a new fashion

1066
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,300
and it helps to get cited more,

1067
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,140
but yeah, there are so all these things built

1068
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,500
on all their interests also.

1069
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,540
Having said that, there is obviously more and more

1070
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:21,020
attention being paid within our studies

1071
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,580
to let's see questions of infrastructure

1072
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,060
and not just narrowly defined,

1073
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,620
but very diverse types of infrastructure,

1074
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,100
as you will see.

1075
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,460
Now, to hear one example, I think which is a good example

1076
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,780
or it discussed by the team and base article

1077
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:37,460
that I mentioned before, which you discussed in this article

1078
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:42,060
is the work of the Chicago based RSTS targets,

1079
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,540
some of you might know him,

1080
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:47,180
where to the left you see a piece that you did

1081
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,940
for the document,

1082
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:57,460
well, not by annual, but document a five yearly festival

1083
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:04,100
in Castell, so the document 2013, which I think was in 2012, even correct. 12 ballast for

1084
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:09,940
Ugunot House, which basically is a restoration of an empty building in Castell using labor and

1085
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:15,460
materials from the south side of Chicago. So it's an interesting case because it was a kind of rundown

1086
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:21,140
building in Castell where we had, let's say, where the 30th of the case, the artist had materials,

1087
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:27,380
but also workers moved transported, so to say, from Chicago to Castell to actually renovate the

1088
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:32,900
stability and to actually perform in the building, et cetera.

1089
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,220
So here's space and let's say the infrastructure

1090
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:38,260
of this space really emerges a kind of social space,

1091
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,140
while at the same time directing attention

1092
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,340
to migrant labor and in the case of the SDK,

1093
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,060
it's work and the kind of the issues

1094
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:48,100
it engages with with black cultural expression

1095
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,380
in a very particular space in Castle.

1096
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,780
So there's a very, let's say,

1097
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,900
concrete artistic intervention.

1098
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:58,180
To a right, you see, let's say, in a way,

1099
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:02,420
the reference project for the castle, the castle case,

1100
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:05,940
which is a door chest project, the projects in Chicago,

1101
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,420
which is basically you can argue,

1102
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:09,300
and it links back, I think, to the previous,

1103
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:14,340
well, addition raised by the Liliq,

1104
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,140
but perhaps in a last, let's say,

1105
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:19,860
planar move, and basically this is a kind of urban

1106
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,940
development project led by TS to Gaze in the south side

1107
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:24,260
which it could go.

1108
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,460
Where it gets started buying up abandoned property

1109
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,940
after the 2008 financial crisis

1110
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,740
and has redeveloped these buildings with local communities,

1111
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:36,580
with other artists, often creating a mix

1112
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:39,340
of artists' spaces, of community spaces,

1113
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:41,300
of, let's say, local restaurants,

1114
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:45,940
or in this particular case, also a library and archive.

1115
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,040
So the Dorchester project.

1116
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,620
Now, what's interesting here, of course,

1117
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:56,060
that we are still in the realm of let's say issues around urban

1118
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:58,780
culture but we've started being more and more attention to

1119
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,660
where practically literally, materially speaking,

1120
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:05,100
are these located. So this really leads them to the material

1121
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,380
infrastructure dimension of urban culture and some of what I

1122
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:12,060
consider to be some of the more interesting, more productive line of

1123
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,060
research on urban culture in the last years, as really looked at these

1124
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:28,220
kind of infrastructure dimensions. Another pushing does a bit broader and perhaps also

1125
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:36,060
becoming less local and is orientation towards infrastructure is a book that I added for the

1126
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:43,980
reading for today by Brian Larkin from 2008, Signal and Noise Media Infrastructure at Urban Culture

1127
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:49,340
Nigeria, which is for those that have rats. I don't expect you to have

1128
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:54,140
rat the full book, but maybe maybe the introduction at least, which is an

1129
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,820
anthropological study on the cultural work of media technologies.

1130
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,820
There's the quote and they're rolling what in producing what we call urban

1131
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:06,860
Africa, focusing on Kano and Muslim city in northern, Islamic city in northern

1132
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:11,820
Nigeria. The lock-in book is interesting because it's just a very interesting

1133
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:18,620
book but also because he flax a number of the base that are, let's say, essential in

1134
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:24,300
research on infrastructures in general or cultural infrastructures in particular.

1135
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:29,860
One being, it's not just about, let's say, pipes, etc. and literally infrastructure,

1136
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:34,500
but also a lot about the symbolic or representational logic of infrastructures.

1137
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,540
So what do infrastructures mean?

1138
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:37,540
How are they interpreted?

1139
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,540
How are they envisioned?

1140
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,580
How are they imagined?

1141
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:44,580
This really receives a lot of attention to think in most of the infrastructure research.

1142
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:54,580
Also, attempts of governments to govern or control these infrastructures, it gives examples of this in the case of Nigeria.

1143
01:13:54,580 --> 01:14:00,580
At the same time, also, the unexpected or unintended consequences of infrastructure development.

1144
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:04,580
Governments, for example, or let's say our local developers can have a plan,

1145
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:12,580
I can't have an idea as to why do you want to develop a certain infrastructure, but it doesn't necessarily mean that infrastructure is also used in this way.

1146
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:20,580
So here we're back a thing to perhaps do the all the discussion about strategies and tactics, but transpose to an infrastructure discussion.

1147
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,920
And the last element related to this, of course,

1148
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,120
is that around these infrastructures,

1149
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,360
we see all kinds of informal social practices

1150
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,000
in everyday life emerging,

1151
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,360
which then are worthy of attention,

1152
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,880
but also worthy of research.

1153
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,760
So the example here I gave, for example,

1154
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,560
you can easily, if I would completely imagine

1155
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,280
how around these spaces, social practices emerge

1156
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:44,360
and are developed.

1157
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,120
And they would perhaps not exist

1158
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,000
without these infrastructures.

1159
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,520
And that's the thing, the importance

1160
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,920
want to keep in mind here.

1161
01:14:51,920 --> 01:15:00,880
Nightly, exactly. It gives, and for me, the most interesting chapter in the book is perhaps

1162
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:07,520
the last chapter, if I remember correctly, on the role of piracy in Nigeria.

1163
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:14,960
So, the example he gives, for example, is how Nigerian video and piracy and circus of distribution

1164
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,680
emerged in Nigeria and how this actually relates to a kind of a

1165
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:25,280
perhaps which goes called a full ecosystem of cultural but also obviously economic activity

1166
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:32,000
largely informal in the sense that it's barely regulated perhaps also illegal or

1167
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,160
illegitimate or something because it's often at that point in time when you did this research

1168
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:44,080
late 19th early 2000s often copies illegal copies of Hollywood and Indian films

1169
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,240
But we're with the same incandel as in Northern Nigeria city,

1170
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:53,680
really emerging literally as a kind of distribution hub for the wider African region.

1171
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:57,520
Yes, so with people on the right for example, selling it on the street,

1172
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,600
but also the same people of other people actually moving the goods so

1173
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,160
to the speed, the material from one city to other cities, often crossing boundaries.

1174
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:11,440
Now from the 1990s onwards, I think we've seen an increasing production also,

1175
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:16,160
and this is the the the argument developed by Larkin of Nigerian and especially

1176
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:22,000
housing language videos leading to a quite organized system of how is that video film production

1177
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,960
but it building on the existing fire and infrastructure. Yeah so again a classic case of informal

1178
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:36,240
urbanism a very slippery or unclear distinction between where when a something still informal when

1179
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:40,960
when does something become formed? Because it has also become part to a certain extent of a formal

1180
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:46,400
registered economy with some business and growing bigger and bigger. But at the same time with,

1181
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:51,760
for example, how has the films aesthetically and organization still been shaped by you to say the

1182
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:59,040
older pirate aesthetics and infrastructure. This is also the kind of research which has received a

1183
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,680
lot of attention in recent years, which I have ever labeled here as being part of, let's say,

1184
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,040
research on cultural infrastructure and informal urbanism.

1185
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:19,520
Or to give another example of paper I wrote myself to get away with a PhD student a while ago

1186
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,120
called Spaces of Open-S Urban Citizenship and Cultural Infrastructure,

1187
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:28,160
to come alive at Istanbul, which focused in Latte in a more institutional way perhaps,

1188
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:34,320
less ethnographic way on the institutional geography of collaboration and support to sustain

1189
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:40,000
local cultural spaces and networks in the shadow of the states. So the argument we develop here is

1190
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,920
that in a Turkey and partially also an Istanbul, increasingly being let's say shaped by kind of

1191
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:52,000
authoritarian, semi-authoritarian state in any case, we discussed in some detail how particular

1192
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,960
cultural organizations salt and depth of the North Coast as Istanbul, they might know the organizations,

1193
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,560
how they act as kind of cultural infrastructures

1194
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,680
of, let's say, common life or a different way

1195
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,560
when we're saying, "Oh, actually public life in Istanbul,"

1196
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:11,640
largely by actually collaborating with very many other organizations,

1197
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,040
but also offering spaces.

1198
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,800
And this is what the image to the right shows--

1199
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,680
sorry, what this image shows--

1200
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,680
offering spaces--

1201
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,760
well, sorry, offering actual space in their buildings

1202
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,080
to all kinds of different organizations.

1203
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:31,280
So you see a kind of let's say hidden or semi hidden cultural infrastructure,

1204
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,200
which doesn't easily show when you look at just the main cultural organizations,

1205
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:39,280
but which really shaped you could say cultural practices in this particular city,

1206
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:45,680
and which is only possible or in any case is made possible by the actual existence of these

1207
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:54,800
actual spaces in the city of Solvindepo. So again, another possible, let's say, entry point,

1208
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:00,400
inter-measage on cultural infrastructures and informal urbanism.

1209
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:07,000
Last point perhaps for this slide, well that's not the last example, is what we see happening

1210
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,720
in the research and cultural infrastructures.

1211
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:13,080
Much of the research on urban culture is research that is most, you could say, fundamental,

1212
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:19,640
let's say, basic, basic real academic research, but it also has a strong applied nature.

1213
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:24,000
And the notion of infrastructure has also started, it emerged or started popping up in

1214
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:30,560
policy documents across the world. That has many consequences, not all of them positive, but to a

1215
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,520
large extent of things is an interesting development where we let's say cultural policy documents and

1216
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,960
cultural actual cultural policy practices did not refer to infrastructure last say 10 years ago.

1217
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,240
We see in the last five years or so we see various organizations, very local and regional governments,

1218
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:53,120
actually using the notion of infrastructure in order to pay attention to certain, let's say,

1219
01:19:53,120 --> 01:20:01,360
infrastructure dimensions of cultural industries also. So here a few examples on the top left

1220
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:06,080
creative city news, cultural infrastructure, an integral component of Canadian communities.

1221
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,320
This is quite strong and again I think it's critique of the creative industries literature,

1222
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:15,760
even among policymakers where we say okay we actually need a wider diversity of cultural

1223
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,200
infrastructures that actually connect with our local communities, whatever that may mean but that's

1224
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:26,960
the last 80 a game. Or for example, sustaining London as a cultural capital, why London needs

1225
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:32,080
the cultural infrastructure plan. This again is not a strand of the debate, I think in policy

1226
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:37,440
communities where we see because of the increasing, let's say gentrification and increasing real estate

1227
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:44,480
price in especially global cities. Even policy makers, let's say mainstream policy has started

1228
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:49,040
realizing that if we continue like this, we're going to have no artists left in the city. So we need

1229
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:54,320
need to actually start thinking about the availability of cultural infrastructure in our cities

1230
01:20:54,320 --> 01:21:00,880
and to make this available literally in order to sort of keep, let's say, the status of

1231
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,600
London as a global city but also as a cultural city. So why London is the cultural infrastructure

1232
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,560
plan? It's similar to the bit around cultural infrastructure at New South Wales, which is

1233
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,280
this mixed-setting also of the Canadian example I just mentioned and the London example of

1234
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,320
available in your space.

1235
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,360
Or another example in Brussels, and this is what

1236
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,200
I'm partially involved in by a panamanan,

1237
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,680
so permanence, the name of the association

1238
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,240
pretty much sums it up, which is a practice-based research

1239
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,200
I'm also now involved in where we try

1240
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,880
to develop an infrastructure for permanently affordable

1241
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:36,760
and about its social and cultural space in Brussels.

1242
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,840
So basically claiming a space in Brussels,

1243
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,600
which is open not just to artists,

1244
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,160
but also to other types of users, such as refugees,

1245
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:48,520
such as social housing, such as university researchers,

1246
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,720
et cetera, in order to look at different models of ownership

1247
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,840
also, where artists are no longer reliant

1248
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,320
and are used on, I say, temporary use,

1249
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,560
but they can actually, let's say, permanently,

1250
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,040
literally, permanently claim space

1251
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,440
through all kinds of ownership models,

1252
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,280
partially building on issues around less

1253
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,440
the community land trust or social co-operatives.

1254
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,360
Okay, that's a lot of information.

1255
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:20,200
Just to sum this up, if you look at the cultural infrastructure in informal urbanism literature,

1256
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,560
I see at least the following analytical shifts.

1257
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:28,800
We have moved, I think, from a concern with the informal economy, in anthropology and

1258
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:34,600
development studies and everyday life tactics and cultural studies to informal urbanism.

1259
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,840
This is the term that is perhaps the most present now.

1260
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:43,000
It's no longer informality as such, but the phrase informal urbanism you see constantly.

1261
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,920
So we've moved to a situation where, sorry, here we are.

1262
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,840
And we see continued interest in labor questions,

1263
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,200
social and badenness of economic relations

1264
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,400
and interrelation of informal networks

1265
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,680
and informal institutions.

1266
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,800
So all the classic informality discussions.

1267
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,400
But at the same time, we see a diversification of topics.

1268
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,480
So it's no longer just about,

1269
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,880
you could save informal labor markets.

1270
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,880
No, it's also about DIY urbanism.

1271
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,520
It's also about co-working space.

1272
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,620
There's also about urela gardening, about co-housing,

1273
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,840
or about artistic interventions in public space.

1274
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,240
It's also about squatting.

1275
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,460
There's also about self-built housing,

1276
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,160
and the list is endless, yeah?

1277
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,040
All these kinds of practices, of course,

1278
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:28,120
each with their own, let's say approaches and styles.

1279
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:32,000
You see all these kinds of practice being labeled

1280
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,720
as expressions of informal urbanism.

1281
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,440
There's a legitimate question to ask,

1282
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,760
how useful such a slippery term is,

1283
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,680
but it has certainly led to a broadening

1284
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,600
of empirical interest.

1285
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,480
As already mentioned before, I think the term informal

1286
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,000
has really helped to move beyond a global style

1287
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,640
first global north studies on cities

1288
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,480
and to really look at the informal urbanism

1289
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,040
as global urbanism.

1290
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,920
Whether the informal in a way has become foundational

1291
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,120
to our understanding of cities at large.

1292
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,520
And the last point I'll skip for now is less ascension.

1293
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,560
Okay, I need a set of water.

1294
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:14,760
questions, please, or comments or additions on this part.

1295
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,000
If any.

1296
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:29,120
Maybe I could ask a question about, let's say,

1297
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,000
these structures, these infrastructures

1298
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,720
growing in the shadow of the state, as you have mentioned it.

1299
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:37,640
So we noticed that actually a lot of communes in Brussels

1300
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:42,640
are trying to set themselves on the, let's say, cultural map.

1301
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:46,920
We are working in urban analysis on the community for her,

1302
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,040
that has its own like a very active plan

1303
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,320
and wants to be a leader and a new place for art

1304
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,800
and culture in Brussels.

1305
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,640
- Yes.

1306
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,640
- I wonder what your take on that was also working with

1307
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,880
with the association that you mentioned,

1308
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,840
you must be seeing also a different side of the influence

1309
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:09,520
of local government in Brussels on that.

1310
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,560
- Yeah, exactly.

1311
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,560
Yeah.

1312
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,080
I mean, I mean, asking a question about a city in which

1313
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,400
I live, of course, is always difficult

1314
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,960
because I can talk about this for hours.

1315
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:22,480
But it's a tricky, I mean, I would say for that

1316
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:26,320
to a logic stance has become a creative or cultural hub

1317
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,800
for artists, which obviously is,

1318
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,880
despite for municipality.

1319
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:39,520
As often happens in Brussels is not because of the government that we see interesting activity happening somewhere.

1320
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:44,960
Brussels is a city that really relies on strong, let's say,

1321
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,720
well, social movements and citizen activity.

1322
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:52,080
And there's also applies a thing to artistic activity for it.

1323
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,720
Have we said that what, of course, which is now see happening is that because for there,

1324
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,240
It has become, let's say, a concentration,

1325
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,920
let's say, for artists, we do see, of course,

1326
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,320
that local municipality is increasing also using this

1327
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,160
to in a way to brand itself, right?

1328
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:14,960
To, as such, there is nothing wrong with this.

1329
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,040
I mean, I don't live in Florida,

1330
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,320
we need to look into very specific local details

1331
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,840
at the same time, and don't have the feeling

1332
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,400
that they have a strong strategic perspective

1333
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:31,400
on the role of arts and culture and the municipality.

1334
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,720
So it doesn't, and that's applied,

1335
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:38,920
it doesn't get to my knowledge, move beyond,

1336
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:42,160
they kind of offering of temporary,

1337
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,640
intermuse spaces for artists.

1338
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:47,480
So it doesn't get seemed to be a kind of broader,

1339
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,600
let's say more substantial perspective on this,

1340
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,400
but maybe you already know more about this

1341
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,880
through the human analysis

1342
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,920
and the work that you've done so far.

1343
01:26:54,920 --> 01:27:03,600
I think we definitely see a lot of policy claims for sure and a lot of use of it.

1344
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,520
So now indeed it's a next challenge to look into how that actually plays out on the ground

1345
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,080
and whether that actually translates into action.

1346
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,560
But thank you for your reaction.

1347
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,560
Yes, thank you.

1348
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,560
Are you a comment as well?

1349
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:25,520
Last year I did a literature study about gentrification in Brussels, especially in the

1350
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,960
region of St. John's Mullenbeck.

1351
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:36,480
We saw in the 80s the Commodoto vartists start living there.

1352
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:43,840
So it became very popular to live there and the results was for people, for people need

1353
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,560
to move out.

1354
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:52,980
So I guess there is always a small dark sites of this one,

1355
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:56,640
we'll just do gentrification especially in Brussels.

1356
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,880
Yeah, I mean, I can only say, in short, yes, to that.

1357
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,040
[LAUGHTER]

1358
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:06,240
Yeah, I mean, there are different opinions on gentrification

1359
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:06,920
in Brussels.

1360
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,440
I mean, some would say, well, there's

1361
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,320
clear gentrification and there's expansion.

1362
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,880
If you look at the numbers that might the actual expulsion of people from

1363
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,080
Circle Look at these might be limited still, but it's clear that certain areas

1364
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:26,080
are changing rapidly. One of the things we're trying to do, which for example,

1365
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,640
the permanent project I'm permanent project I mentioned, is to also think

1366
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:32,960
about spatial because one of the problems is let's say artists move into

1367
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:38,000
certain spaces. They are looking for, let's say, work and living spaces, but in a

1368
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,720
way, unintentionally so they then actually lead to a push out effect for

1369
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:46,720
other for adolescent poor citizens in most cases.

1370
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,440
At the same time, it's not as if artists are belonging

1371
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,880
let's say to an urban elite in general.

1372
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:55,160
So one of the very small level of retries

1373
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,640
to do with the permanent project is also

1374
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:00,800
to try to think of, let's say, spaces that are co-owned

1375
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:05,320
and where let's say the move of artists into a certain area

1376
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:08,000
does not automatically translate into the move out

1377
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,200
of other citizens.

1378
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,960
Realistically speaking, of course, my position on this

1379
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:18,920
is that this can only partially be solved on a project level

1380
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,400
because practically speaking, you simply need more social housing

1381
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,360
for this.

1382
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,760
And most of this is disastrous city

1383
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,000
when it comes to percentage of social housing,

1384
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,680
let alone quality of social housing.

1385
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,640
We're really talking about a few percentages

1386
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:36,320
of the total housing stock, which is social housing,

1387
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,920
which is completely different, for example,

1388
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,760
in a city such as Amsterdam,

1389
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,960
which has also seen gentrification obviously,

1390
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,040
but that's the social housing stock.

1391
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,800
Definitely helps there with all his own complexities

1392
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,400
and problems.

1393
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,240
So yeah.

1394
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:54,800
Any other comments?

1395
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,840
No, okay.

1396
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:04,840
Then I'll move to the last section I think of the session.

1397
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:09,400
I think we're more or less okay on time, which is good.

1398
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:13,840
So I did, I promised last week that I would also have a separate section on tourism.

1399
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,840
I don't.

1400
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,080
So I didn't manage to fit it in.

1401
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:20,560
And it's picked up in some of these elements implicitly, I think.

1402
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,760
So I'm also less of an expert on urban tourism.

1403
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,160
I know the literature quite well, but it's not something that I do research on myself.

1404
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:32,720
But this is certainly also, let's see, another strand of research, which is interesting

1405
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:35,080
from an urban cultural perspective.

1406
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:40,320
However, the last strand I want to discuss with you today is literature which is perhaps

1407
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:46,720
more closely related to the humanities than some other elements that I discussed with you today,

1408
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:52,640
which I flag here as the research on sensory urbanism, visual cultures or sensory urbanism,

1409
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:57,040
and then two examples, visual cultures and sounds.

1410
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,880
Brian Locke is text that was on your reading for today already highlighted, I think, how

1411
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:06,800
media technologies and aesthetics shape urban places. So this idea that actually by building

1412
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,920
certain distribution infrastructures, by having certain places, you actually shape urban places

1413
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:17,360
through truly technologies and aesthetics. In term, and this you could see is, let's say, the more

1414
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:23,120
experiential, phenomenological or our user point of view, this implies also that places are

1415
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:29,040
experienced through multiple senses, seeing, listening, smelling, touching, tasting. Now,

1416
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,760
Historically, most research has focused on the visual dimension.

1417
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,520
But increasingly, we also see it, and this

1418
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,680
has a long, long history.

1419
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:38,240
I'll give a few simple examples in a minute.

1420
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,920
But increasingly, we also see the attention

1421
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,840
paid to other senses.

1422
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,360
And I'll briefly discuss this to research, which I think

1423
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,600
is pretty interesting, but obviously,

1424
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:50,760
in bias, because I tend to like, mostly, or focus mostly

1425
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:54,000
on music and sound myself.

1426
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,680
But I'll briefly discuss some of the research

1427
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:00,840
on the auditory culture, sonic cultures, or music and sound.

1428
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:05,480
Now, to start with the visual culture spots,

1429
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,760
so remember Jameson.

1430
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:10,440
So this is, let's say, the hotel that we've already discussed

1431
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:13,560
in Jameson text 1984.

1432
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:16,200
Basically, you could say one element of,

1433
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,120
if not star architecture, but at least,

1434
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,560
let's see various sort of in-your-face architecture.

1435
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:26,520
And within our studies, a lot of attention has been paid to this kind of architecture,

1436
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:32,960
So based to buildings designed to leave a strong visual impression because that is what these buildings do and what they aim to do

1437
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,520
Now the analytical focus starting already in the 1980s

1438
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:42,560
Some elements have let's say survived the years others have not has been on cognitive disorientation

1439
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:50,480
But also on landmark statements in a city with emphasis on spectacle and surveillance with emphasis in consumption landscapes and

1440
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,880
An emphasis on represitation and global attractiveness

1441
01:32:54,320 --> 01:33:02,200
So this is all you can say well rehearse territory within urban studies and which has a long history of of analysis

1442
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,440
Now star architecture you literally

1443
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:09,560
Ads value to world cities are aspiring world cities

1444
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:14,000
So the architecture becomes you could say an urban icon in global rankings

1445
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:22,360
It really helps and here is it there is a tourism reference. It really helps to put world cities on the map for tourism and consumption purposes

1446
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:29,560
these sites or the surrounding areas become sites for business investment or also for upmarket

1447
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:36,920
Residential houses. So they literally had value to aspire the world sees true legacy strong visual claims

1448
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:43,560
Now this has this of course has a history, right? This is not we have we should not be naive

1449
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:48,280
Let's historically and leave and pretend that this is something of less in the post for this age

1450
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,240
or something that we've only seen since the late 20th century,

1451
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,920
although it probably has a increase

1452
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,520
and probably, let's say, more,

1453
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,880
let's say, professional and strategic attention

1454
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,760
is now being a paid to, let's say,

1455
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,720
the visual dimension of cities compared to the,

1456
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:08,320
let's say, the decades before.

1457
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,760
But it has the much longer history.

1458
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,480
The most obvious or let's say a classic example,

1459
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,160
of course, being the Eiffel Tower,

1460
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:17,960
which itself was built to put Paris on the map

1461
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,000
or to make it more visual again.

1462
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,880
Part of, let's say, if a broader exhibition set up,

1463
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,360
originally intended temporary,

1464
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,680
but has been therefore quite some time,

1465
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,920
which now is a classic landmark case in,

1466
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:33,120
or example in, whoops sorry,

1467
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:37,480
around the world when people think about Paris.

1468
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:42,280
Or another example,

1469
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:45,720
so I'm working with two computers here.

1470
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,680
So this is sometimes confusing.

1471
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,600
Another example, the Opera House in Sydney.

1472
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,400
Again, an example, even if you've never visited Sydney,

1473
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,200
you will know this building.

1474
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,200
The Opera House in Sydney architect,

1475
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:01,960
Jion-Otsan, or another example, which I think by now also

1476
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,720
everyone knows, which is perhaps in a way

1477
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:07,080
the more recent example, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,

1478
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:13,720
Spain, which in its very setup was intended to leave

1479
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,880
you could see a visual impression.

1480
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,880
And you will see that many people visit the Google

1481
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:21,000
NIMU's email bill bow without seeing anything else

1482
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,880
or a very little of bill bow as such.

1483
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:28,520
So I would dare to claim that the vast majority of people

1484
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:31,200
that visit the Google NIMU's email bill bow

1485
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,160
will leave the city without really knowing much

1486
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,480
about bill bow.

1487
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,760
Yeah, I mean, there's not a question if they should be.

1488
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,440
It should.

1489
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,760
But it's clear that this kind of visual attraction

1490
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:41,920
plays a key role.

1491
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:45,120
and has played at the same time in an almost role

1492
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,640
in increasing tourism flows towards global.

1493
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:51,840
Or even more recent example, the Elfilam,

1494
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:56,840
the Afro-Hos in Hamburg, 800 million euros,

1495
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:00,760
enormously over budget, which is very typical also

1496
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:03,320
for someone that allowed to start architecture.

1497
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,320
But in general though, and not surprising perhaps also

1498
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,240
is that many of these buildings are cultural landmarks

1499
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,360
that both offer you the same culture

1500
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,120
and a design space for tourism and consumption.

1501
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:17,680
So this, as I said, this is well-rehearsed territory,

1502
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,280
still a lot of interesting research is being done on this,

1503
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:23,440
but it's quite established in the base.

1504
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,960
I'll give some example.

1505
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:28,080
Of course, that leads to all kinds of discussions also

1506
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,840
about who has the biggest tower,

1507
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:33,200
I won't go into the masculine connotations

1508
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,800
of building the world's tallest building,

1509
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,720
but it's quite obvious here, the Gosh Khalifa,

1510
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:43,600
And also a thing in this is perhaps a shift which is new work,

1511
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,680
although also not completely new,

1512
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,480
is that especially in the same world global cities,

1513
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,480
such as New York, such as London,

1514
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,960
we see a lot of entice being paid by private developers

1515
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,040
to very upmarket elite residential housing.

1516
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:59,800
So this is height one in London, for example.

1517
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:06,560
It is interesting also because there's somebody's space

1518
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,560
for upmarket residential housing,

1519
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,240
They are built to leave a visual impact.

1520
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,240
They are built to attract buyers, multi-buyers.

1521
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,320
But let's say they're running jokingly or low.

1522
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:17,520
The sadness of the story in many ways

1523
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:22,200
is that if you look at how, for which period of the year,

1524
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,680
these apartments or buildings are actually occupied

1525
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,920
by actual inhabitants is often quite limited.

1526
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:32,240
Some of these are just apartments to park, to park like money,

1527
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,120
but not necessarily laundry money,

1528
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,960
but not necessarily actually lived there for us

1529
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,520
state is a substantial period of the year.

1530
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:48,400
Or another example in New York for the 4-23 Park Avenue.

1531
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:53,280
Perhaps less spectacular, but maybe in 10 in a similar direction,

1532
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:58,000
these visually speaking, is this building at the Canal Zone,

1533
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,400
the upside tower in Brussels. But the prices are certainly more affordable

1534
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:06,000
than the word the price you will see in New York or London.

1535
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,160
Now, what's interesting about this visual culture, especially in sort of new media times,

1536
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:17,760
is that these landmark statements, these are actual buildings, these are buildings very

1537
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:25,040
much, let's say, very costly investments in urban space. But the vast majority of people

1538
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:29,600
will know these buildings, they will see these buildings through social media and online

1539
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:35,840
magazines or maybe let's say a coffee-tailed book magazines. So these buildings play a massive

1540
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:41,040
an important role in city branding and hopefully attracting cultural tourism and also in

1541
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:45,840
circulating on social media. So you've got images such as this where as the local Instagram

1542
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:52,800
is a search for star architecture or spectacular architecture you will see loads of images or even

1543
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:59,600
Let's say in New York using using, let's say, certain space or new builds in New York

1544
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,800
and labeling it as best Instagram spots.

1545
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:06,960
And then you get these interesting, let's say, tourists who basically photograph themselves

1546
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:12,280
with the building in the background as it kind of goes, let's say I've been there kind

1547
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,280
of attitudes.

1548
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,440
But it's quite obvious where sort of the spectacular architect plays a key role not in

1549
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,480
in relation to questions actual use,

1550
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:23,000
but Lashi and request in relation to questions of re-presentation,

1551
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,720
and how can you actually,

1552
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,960
how well these images look like on Instagram

1553
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,200
or other websites.

1554
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:35,120
Now, this is,

1555
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:37,160
it's perfectly this is interesting.

1556
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,160
These are new phenomena with longer histories,

1557
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,720
but very interesting.

1558
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,560
Theoretically, you had raised certain questions

1559
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:47,120
about how we should look at city developments,

1560
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:51,200
how we should look at how cities change over time.

1561
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,040
This ties in, I would argue with a literature

1562
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:56,240
on what is sometimes called geographies of circulation,

1563
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,640
where we really try to understand city cultures

1564
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:00,480
as an effect of circulation.

1565
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,600
So not necessarily designed locally,

1566
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,320
but actually images traveling between cities.

1567
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:08,240
Of course, also traveling of architects and other experts,

1568
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:11,520
but also concepts, images, plans, best practices.

1569
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,160
So where urban culture as such,

1570
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,120
perhaps also urban policy as such,

1571
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,800
becomes a kind of practice of inter-referencing.

1572
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,460
So the city's referencing each other,

1573
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,360
or building's referencing each other,

1574
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:26,040
to stake out the claim, so to speak.

1575
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,560
Now, all this links back in my view,

1576
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,680
although not always recognize the such within the Middle

1577
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,680
United River studies, to classic cultural studies concerns

1578
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,960
with the politics of representation,

1579
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:37,960
but also to an anthropological interest.

1580
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,280
And there's a very nice book and article,

1581
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,240
but I am up a duet I already from the late 1980s,

1582
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,200
on the social life of objects.

1583
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:49,680
So how do objects travel true space and true time?

1584
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,800
Okay.

1585
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,480
Last section for today,

1586
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,400
because this is our set,

1587
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:58,200
is it's well, well,

1588
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,000
it's trial and theory within nervous studies

1589
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,280
to really look at the visual

1590
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:04,120
in relation to the urban.

1591
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:07,560
But especially, yeah, the last 10, 20 years,

1592
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,160
I guess we see an increasing interest

1593
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,560
also in other senses and the urban.

1594
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:13,160
The example, I briefly want to discuss

1595
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,920
which you today as a closure for the lecture,

1596
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:19,280
isn't it this research and auditory sonic cultures

1597
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,880
to vocabulary tends to differ?

1598
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,320
There is a lot of interesting work being done on this still,

1599
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:28,140
sometimes also by practicing artists,

1600
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:30,440
practicing musicians that also write,

1601
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,600
such as for example, Brandon Labell,

1602
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:35,280
who were quite a nice book on acoustic territories,

1603
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,760
sound culture, and everyday lives.

1604
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,920
So you see again, everyday life returning

1605
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,880
as vocabulary.

1606
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,540
So in chapter three, for example,

1607
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:47,380
which is some of the examples I use here,

1608
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:49,020
where you explicitly build some

1609
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:51,460
of the subtodes to practice a very alive,

1610
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:54,060
and where we develop the view on walking,

1611
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:57,020
not an individual way, as actually just had told

1612
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:58,980
because he had a lot of discussions as a tool

1613
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:00,740
about how you look in relation to building,

1614
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:03,420
how you position yourself in relation to the city,

1615
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,220
but where we develop the view in walking through

1616
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:08,420
an auditory or rhythmic perspectives.

1617
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:10,100
And then it gives all kinds of examples,

1618
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,860
such as crosswalk signals, warning alarms,

1619
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:17,660
or personal audio, so listening on your smartphone to music while walking through the city,

1620
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:21,360
but also for example sound art or marching bands or protest,

1621
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:28,660
and a role sound place in let's say experiencing and structuring, let's say city life.

1622
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:35,160
It gives the example, for example, of Floriano Humano, Philante Sao Paulo.

1623
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:38,960
I think he actually mentions his Rio de Janeiro, but I think it's in Sao Paulo.

1624
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:45,160
We walked around with a big speaker on his back,

1625
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:50,800
which basically with a voice, speaking on loud,

1626
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,880
something like don't pay attention to them

1627
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,240
if I remember correctly.

1628
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:56,680
So we're walking around the streets in public space,

1629
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:00,080
don't pay attention, don't pay attention,

1630
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:03,080
which obviously the exact opposite will then happen,

1631
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:06,640
which is a pretty nice or neat intervention,

1632
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:12,360
I think in public space as a kind of art project.

1633
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:15,920
Another example is that we have an active network.

1634
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,000
And this is a much longer history, also, of field

1635
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:18,520
records.

1636
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,520
People doing field recordings.

1637
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,280
There's a very nice website for those

1638
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:26,760
that are into this stuff, which is called Sound Cities.

1639
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:30,360
Just Google it, you'll find it, which has collected, let's say,

1640
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:33,160
field records from cities across the world,

1641
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,560
a way you can actually play-- well, it's

1642
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,320
that the maps literally on the map of these cities

1643
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,400
are where you can play, let's say,

1644
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,480
sounds from these cities or from these particular locations

1645
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:42,680
in these cities.

1646
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:43,640
And that's the lesson,

1647
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:44,920
ever growing database,

1648
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:48,280
but there's also active community of sound recording,

1649
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:51,000
field records, recording sounds or cities.

1650
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,240
And it's quite nice if you have a bit of time

1651
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,400
to, let's say, to go through some of the sounds

1652
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,000
and also experience some of the, let's say,

1653
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,440
differences in sounds are between, between different cities.

1654
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:08,440
One example I want to just briefly play and I hope there's all the works with sounds.

1655
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:11,440
I'm just going to play it and then you're going to have to tell me if you hear the sounds.

1656
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,440
Turn on do turn on the sounds.

1657
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:18,000
It's a very nice piece I think by Finn's Bloom and Mexican artist, Simba Fova-Sun

1658
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:28,800
novel from Mexico City 2015, where we basically manipulated the walking signals of on the street

1659
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:36,080
in Mexico City, and where we replaced the sound of a pedestrian traffic light with the

1660
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:41,440
like, that's a classic sound, with the sound of a donkey, which according to him is a nice

1661
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:46,880
way of well, paying attention to well. First of all, making people think differently or

1662
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:50,400
look differently, right, this is something else than I expected, so it's a kind of intervention,

1663
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:55,600
but also attracting attention to an animal which has largely disappeared from Mexico City,

1664
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:02,320
Cizzies urban space which was different last say 30, 40, 50 years ago.

1665
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:06,080
So I'm just going to look at this works and you're going to have to tell me just do it like this

1666
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,560
or something if the sound is okay.

1667
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:21,040
Do your sounds? Okay perfect, no, just kidding.

1668
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,440
Good job, Good job.

1669

(music)

1677
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:38,900
Okay, so just one small example which I thought is a pretty nice intervention with a lot

1678
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:39,900
of humor.

1679
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:43,820
Fili's bloom also did quite, he's done a lot of work as a sound artist, he also did quite

1680
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:48,100
some interesting work and this is kind of early work if you'd argue.

1681
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:53,820
But where later on he actually worked in collaboration with blind people to actually and

1682
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:58,100
let's say sounds and their experience of urban space in order to sort of make

1683
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:02,500
artistic well artistic projects which is also some interesting work to just

1684
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:06,660
check this website if you're interested in this kind of stuff.

1685
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:12,260
This example I'll move to the very end which is a nice example by the way of

1686
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:18,100
sound and protest and there are many examples of this following the 2011

1687
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:21,780
Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.

1688
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:29,540
Japan's are actually a wide range of public protests. Here is one example which was a sound demo

1689
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:36,980
organized by Elus Association called Shiroto Noan, amateur revolt, and the organ as a kind of sound

1690
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:42,340
demo protest, which is pretty neat if you like noise, which I do. But since it's a 10 minute video,

1691
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:50,260
I will leave this for the very end and close my... Sorry, that one will come in a second.

1692
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:54,060
and move to my conclusions.

1693
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:56,300
Before I do so, are there any questions

1694
01:47:56,300 --> 01:48:00,580
on the section on the sensory organism?

1695
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:07,220
And I know it's almost 8 p.m. so I know it's late.

1696
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:10,420
Yeah, just unmute yourself and start talking

1697
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:12,660
because I don't see anyone in my screen.

1698
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:16,260
- Okay, I would just like to share with you

1699
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:18,420
and with me, can be interested

1700
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:22,400
and the project of Sandoff tourism.

1701
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,460
- Oh, that's Mico Sanchez in Lisbon.

1702
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:28,700
He might be the sound of tourism in the city

1703
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,700
and it's pretty interesting to his staff.

1704
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,020
- Thanks, thanks a lot.

1705
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:34,620
I don't know, Jia, so I'll check it out.

1706
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:35,900
Very cool, yeah.

1707
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:36,740
Okay, thanks.

1708
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:41,620
Are there comments, suggestions, interventions?

1709
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:43,500
Nope.

1710
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,620
I will wrap up the new conclusions

1711
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,220
and then after the conclusions,

1712
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:51,140
I will move to the Tokyo video,

1713
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:52,980
but there's obviously no obligation to sit

1714
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:54,340
through 12 minutes of noise,

1715
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:57,700
so I just leave it playing for those that are interested,

1716
01:48:57,700 --> 01:49:02,220
but I will conclude and say bye after the conclusions.

1717
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:06,740
Okay, to wrap up this relatively intense session,

1718
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:08,900
I think around the different strands of research

1719
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:12,700
on urban culture, what I try to get across

1720
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:15,700
is that research and urban cultures is a thriving

1721
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:17,100
and more perhaps more importantly,

1722
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:18,700
or equally important,

1723
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:21,220
an inter-transdisciplinary field of research.

1724
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:23,120
It's increasingly difficult to distinguish

1725
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:26,420
between disciplines in research and urban cultures,

1726
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:30,180
which perhaps is a trend that applies to all teams,

1727
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:31,080
you could say,

1728
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:32,340
but it definitely thing it applies

1729
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:35,220
most strongly to research and urban culture.

1730
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:38,780
Building on 1980s, '99 is the bait on the cultural term,

1731
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:42,140
postmodernism and urban and the symbolic economy,

1732
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:43,860
and to interaction with urban and topology

1733
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:44,940
and cultural studies,

1734
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:47,240
particularly to notion studies inform informality

1735
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:49,240
and formal urbanist in every life.

1736
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,600
What we see is that urban studies is really diversified

1737
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,240
into multiple strands of research

1738
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:55,720
dedicated to cultural issues.

1739
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,320
It's important to make distinctions here

1740
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:59,920
because different strands have different artists,

1741
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,040
have different communities of practice.

1742
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,240
But I would say there are three different strands

1743
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:08,480
that are most interesting, but they really might do cover,

1744
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:09,720
and they're not the only strands,

1745
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:14,280
but I do think they cover, let's say 80% of the urban studies

1746
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:19,320
research on urban culture, perhaps with the exception of urban tourism and cultural issues,

1747
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,840
which I didn't discuss in detail today.

1748
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:26,560
The first one being the arts, activism and urban engagement, the second cultural infrastructure

1749
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:33,440
to inform urbanism and the third strength around sensory urbanism, a very brief, two examples

1750
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:36,520
on visual cultures and sounds.

1751
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:39,920
That's it from my side for today.

1752
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:46,560
there are no further questions that I will move back to the to this presentation.

1753
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:53,280
Sorry to this video. I have one quick question. I have one question. I have any connections

1754
01:50:53,280 --> 01:51:03,520
between Sanzuri Urbanism and Clubing Culture for instance. Limited, limited. I think it's in the

1755
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:08,560
research is limited. I think the Clubing Culture literature as far as I know is largely

1756
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,080
your literature that builds on the elastic

1757
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,400
classic cultural studies tradition,

1758
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,040
focusing on, let's say, youth culture,

1759
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:18,840
popular culture, sociological approaches, by and large.

1760
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,840
However, it's, if you look at, let's say,

1761
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,480
practitioners in club and culture,

1762
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,400
then I think there are stronger connections,

1763
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,720
especially those working in, let's say,

1764
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:31,400
electronic music, moving, let's say,

1765
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,000
from a minimal techno orientation

1766
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,640
who have increasingly moved into, let's say,

1767
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:41,200
modern composition and/or indeed fieldwork type, fields with

1768
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:50,400
course, type of work. There you will see artists who, well, sort of transcend

1769
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,920
boundaries who connect these things because they then become, you could say,

1770
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,600
sensory urbanists through their practice. But in the research I would say,

1771
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:01,520
less so, they seem to be quite separate. Well, they are to a lot of

1772
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:05,120
stand-quite separate fields. But which doesn't mean that

1773
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:08,120
could actually cannot be made so that maybe then your job.

1774
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:16,520
Well, I'm thinking, I have one example in mind of the

1775
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:21,820
Tbilisi in Georgia where last year there were very big

1776
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:24,720
protests, I have to say, I really don't know the details about it,

1777
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:32,420
but I know there was also some substantial mobilization from clubs

1778
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:38,420
and from people, from artists and people from that scene.

1779
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:46,420
And you saw some sort of collaboration between these people from

1780
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:52,180
top coaches, to say, and more political movements and also using music in public space as a form

1781
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:57,860
of protest. Yeah, that happens, of course. I think in the Berlin example I used before,

1782
01:52:57,860 --> 01:53:02,500
I think you also see these examples of public protest and music.

1783
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:05,780
I mean, the classic example of the love parade started.

1784
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:08,020
How would you could say as a political movement,

1785
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:13,620
even though I would argue it was heavily commodified soon after or increasingly so.

1786
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:18,900
But the century urbanism literature perhaps relates more to the experimental

1787
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:22,100
sides and to the sound, not even necessarily music.

1788
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:24,260
And that's the different kind of scene, are you?

1789
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:32,900
although there is overlap obviously. So yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Any other comments, questions?

1790
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:39,700
Perhaps just a very practical question from me regarding the seminars that will follow in the coming

1791
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:48,420
weeks. Yes. And I wonder how the presentations will go. I asked because we were asked in the past

1792
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:52,980
to record the video of our presentation and I wondered if you wanted the same or if we will give

1793
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:56,340
that in person. Yes, the rule would be what remained the same. I think that's how it was

1794
01:53:56,340 --> 01:54:00,340
communicated also. So I would actually need to look into the details myself because I've been busy

1795
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:09,060
with the lectures so far. But the idea would still be that the recordings are recorded in advance,

1796
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:14,020
and then we have the... and you was evil to me or you... and I'm represented. Yes.

1797
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,020
Right, thanks.

1798
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:18,020
So I'm sorry.

1799
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:19,020
Sorry.

1800
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,020
Okay.

1801
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:21,020
Yeah.

1802
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:22,020
Okay.

1803
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:24,420
That will move to the presentation, but it's 8 p.m.

1804
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:32,020
So this is just when I say the hardcore survivors who want to stick around for a bit longer.

1805
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:33,620
I'm going to say goodbye in any case.

1806
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:36,220
I will also look at it again.

1807
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:38,860
So you can still chat if you want to.

1808
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:40,820
And then thank you for your attention.

1809
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:46,820
And I will see, well, I think everyone of you next week during the seminar.

1810
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:47,820
