[BLANK_AUDIO]

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:48,820
All right, welcome everybody to

6
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,100
Urban Geography Urban Social Geography.

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,740
I had to work a little bit to make the live stream work.

8
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,860
I hope it does work.

9
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,020
Does anybody mind if I take off my mask?

10
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,780
Is that okay?

11
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,020
If anybody's uncomfortable, just let me know.

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,020
But I rely on my facial expressions for content.

13
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,740
How do you say that to transfer content, if you will?

14
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,420
So hi, I'm David for your lecture.

15
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,220
And welcome to the course.

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,420
I'm very glad that we can teach and have this in real life

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,100
in person.

18
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,580
We'll tell you more about the kind of hybrid character,

19
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,060
because we'll also be recording the sessions

20
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,500
and live streaming the session.

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,620
So I think the pandemic conditions are still

22
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,340
ongoing to allow if you would doubt

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,460
about any infection, et cetera, to follow the course remotely.

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,460
I think this can be more evident for the regular lectures like we have today.

25
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,460
There is also a number of discussions seminars.

26
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,460
There will be less evidence and there's also excursions for some there.

27
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:18,460
I mean, I can't stream an excursion, but for the lectures it will be now turned.

28
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,460
And you also have the recording at the end of the lecture series.

29
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,460
and this could be an interesting instrument to study.

30
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,460
So yeah, that also has students have used it last year.

31
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,460
Okay, so what are the objectives of the entire course,

32
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,460
urban geography, urban social geography?

33
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,460
Well, just summed up there.

34
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,460
I won't go too deep into this just here and now.

35
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,460
But just that you know what you're signing up for,

36
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,460
for the people that are still shopping around,

37
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,940
around, I would say.

38
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,340
The objective of the course is to give an introduction

39
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,700
to key theoretical debates in urban studies,

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,220
nor specifically focusing on spatial and geographical dimensions,

41
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,260
hence it's not introduction to urban studies

42
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,100
but introduction to urban geography.

43
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,780
And this is kind of signaling what

44
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,220
we find important as lecturers to adopt a theoretically

45
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,540
It's your list of approach to work urban studies.

46
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,940
You'll see that, and I'll get to that in a second,

47
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,700
that we work with different teachers, lectures.

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,300
We all have their own backgrounds,

49
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,660
and they may be slightly different.

50
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,980
Some people work more on political economy,

51
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,060
perspective, others start from adopting a perspective

52
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,420
from diversity and ethnicity,

53
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,420
yet others are interested in issues of culture,

54
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,900
in the broad sense, and always work in a kind of mobility framework.

55
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,660
I'm going to try to bring those things together in one course.

56
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,420
But what is kind of uniting the course,

57
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,660
I think a spatial social spatial understanding

58
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,300
of contemporary cities.

59
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,580
So that's what you're signing up for.

60
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,220
If you hate 50s, this is the moment to leave the room.

61
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,340
I told you so.

62
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,260
So this is the old male panel that we present to my

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:23,820
in serious apologies, but I think that hopefully diversity, of course the curriculum is a bit

64
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:32,700
better than within this course, but we're selecting from the people that can teach so please accept

65
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,660
my apologies for that, but still we hope that we can inform you from the range of perspectives.

66
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,180
Also, including I would say feminist perspectives, and they will pop up here and there,

67
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,220
especially when we start talking about issues of culture and issues of mobility and

68
00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:05,340
trans

69
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,180
Bosom Hörf, he's an expert, you could say,

70
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,500
creative industries, cultural geographies of the cities,

71
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,660
of the city, Poitek Geblowski, he wrote a PhD

72
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,780
on fair free public transportation,

73
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,900
and he's an expert in urban studies, slash transportation

74
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,060
geographies, and recently he's really pushing

75
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,220
for a kind of decolonial agenda in transport geographies.

76
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,540
And finally, there's me.

77
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,740
I won't say I'm an expert in editing.

78
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,380
I'm an expert in coordinating this course by now.

79
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,180
And I come from a background of world and global cities.

80
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,220
So what happens to cities, a mid-globalization,

81
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,180
how should we study that, analyze that,

82
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,020
well, I mean, debate.

83
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,820
Conversely, I've been looking a lot into the geographies

84
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,180
of Islamic finance as a way to understand,

85
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,140
I would say Middle Eastern processes of urbanization.

86
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,780
But that was my PhD.

87
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,820
Currently, I'm more working in teams

88
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,460
around financial companies, more widely thinking about

89
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,420
what typifies global cities as command and controls.

90
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,540
There's all kinds of things that I'll be killing you with

91
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,900
in the next few sessions.

92
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,340
So I won't say anything more about that.

93
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,060
So that's the teaching team.

94
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,380
And so there's plural voices to some extent.

95
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,380
And also there's also a plural audience.

96
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,940
So I was already referring to group students

97
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,980
by pointing to that this is the urban social geography course,

98
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,820
but also it's also the urban geography course.

99
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,300
And there's slight differences between both courses,

100
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,180
but especially for the lectures that

101
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,140
makes complete sense to bring you together in the room.

102
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,660
So we have the master in urban studies.

103
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,380
It will be master.

104
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,700
Please raise your hands and voices.

105
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,420
Okay, thanks for the hands.

106
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,340
This for citizens.

107
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,500
Yeah, so that's even more exotic.

108
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,780
These people travel around Europe in the next two years.

109
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,500
Then we have our own exotic species

110
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,180
from the Bachelor of Geography.

111
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,420
Maybe raise your hand.

112
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,060
Welcome.

113
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,780
And we also have urbanists in the room.

114
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,420
So please show me where you are.

115
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,060
These people also combine us with an actual job.

116
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,900
So that's also why we teach at night to accommodate that.

117
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,620
And these are people that have quite a bit of professional expertise.

118
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:56,540
So I would say this is already a global urban map here confined in this room.

119
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:03,220
I would say enjoy this mix and try to pick each other's brains as much as possible.

120
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,220
They're just by comparing urban experiences, concasal conversation.

121
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,460
You can already learn quite a bit.

122
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:21,500
So similarities, all students have lectures and discussion seminars.

123
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,980
This discussion seminar for capacity reasons will be split.

124
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,940
I'll tell you more about that.

125
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,660
For urban social geographers, so that's

126
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,060
for the mouse and urban cities and for citizens,

127
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,140
we're kind of new to Belgium.

128
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,660
We also offer kinds of excursions.

129
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,220
And I'll say more about that as well.

130
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,260
And these are mandatory.

131
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,380
And, follow.

132
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,620
So how does the course look like there's nine lectures,

133
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,540
which we will try to make as interactive as possible.

134
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,840
but there will be a degree of me and us telling you stuff.

135
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,740
The discussion seminars will be way more flipped,

136
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,540
if you will, where the content is prepared by you

137
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,140
and then we discussed this in the classroom.

138
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,580
So it's a bit of a give and take there.

139
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,940
We organized the lectures in modules.

140
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,300
So you can say this for modules.

141
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,420
One organized by me, which deals with

142
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:31,660
general introduction as you note today and then we'll delve into theories of world

143
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,780
and global cities looking at what explains their genesis what their

144
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:43,020
characteristics are, why matters and what kind of the main processes are that

145
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:48,700
characterize urban societies in world and global cities and one of the main

146
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:57,180
the base there is to what extent are these places polarized, either in terms of ethnicity,

147
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:06,260
income levels, professional levels, etc. With that sensitivity, I would say to an evenness

148
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:13,380
within cities, I'll pass on the word to Nick Schuirmont, who focus more on processes of urban

149
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,780
segregation, we're looking at the spatial processes behind that and one of the main debates

150
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:27,460
I would say in issues of diversity and ethnicity is to what extent there are neighborhood effects.

151
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:35,140
It is the fact that you live within a neighborhood affecting your future trajectories,

152
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,220
like chances, etc. So that's one of the main debates there and this

153
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,580
pros and cons, there's arguments for and against the existence of neighborhood effects.

154
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:54,180
Then we pass on to Bosch von Hüd, who will be talking about, you could say, the cultural approach,

155
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:02,340
thinking about different cultures of urban research. And so this deals with various methods,

156
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:09,300
and mostly what you could say, an older cultural turn within geography and social sciences,

157
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,820
more widely, which was took place after Second World War.

158
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,460
And then more recently in the 80s and 90s,

159
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,620
to the real cultural turn where

160
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,780
was all about a turn towards more qualitative research methods,

161
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,820
other sources that could be studied

162
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,420
and that could serve the study

163
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,700
of urban societies.

164
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,220
And then this is also mobilized in the study

165
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,420
of urban culture, where it's about creative industries,

166
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,340
the lives of artists, et cetera,

167
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,000
which is a big element in a lot of,

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,840
say, this course is on the creative city.

169
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,440
As you may know, the work of Richard Florida,

170
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,440
it was a whole hype, I would say, 20 years ago

171
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,600
that all cities should be geared toward becoming creative

172
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
in one way or another.

173
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,080
So hence, also, a large focus and literature

174
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,000
on issues of ISP culture,

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
as it is connected to the shoes of urban development.

176
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,280
And then the final part is with Voigtek Blobsky,

177
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,600
looking into the lens of transport and mobility

178
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,640
at what we can learn about cities.

179
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,320
And he will be talking about different kinds of agendas

180
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,920
that typify, I would say,

181
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,920
transpities all the way from your classical views

182
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,200
that connected to urban growth development

183
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,640
to sustainability issues, which is a paradigm in an open zone.

184
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,560
And then he'll be drawing on his own research,

185
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,720
looking more into what he calls critical perspectives

186
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,880
on urban transport, where it's all about, yeah,

187
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,640
who actually benefits from the current transportation regime,

188
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,000
what are issues of inequality, who makes decisions

189
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,360
about in transport systems, I'd say.

190
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,440
So I think by the end, you should have a kind of

191
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:12,680
360 degree overview of debates in urban geography obviously. We don't know everything far from that.

192
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:19,720
So it's a selection of debates. We could generate another curriculum based with other forms of

193
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:27,000
expertise. But it's also an exercise in trying to critically try and relate different perspectives

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,320
on the city to different kind of teams which come with your own methodologies etc. So that's the

195
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:41,160
setup of the course and these take place here. You're just about fit in this room so I'm extremely

196
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:50,040
happy and pleased and we'll take place on Mondays between five and seven. Let's see what the quality

197
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,520
of the streaming is. If I would open for nocto which is my program I could expect a stream of

198
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,520
comments about that. But so I'll evaluate that but the idea is that everything is

199
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,840
streamed as well. People that come make it because of conflicts with work or

200
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,920
well they might have time but can't reach VB because it's immediately after

201
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,520
the working day I mean I would understand that you would yeah follow

202
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:27,160
remotely and sessions will also be recorded. On the other hand, it's a kind of

203
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:33,160
strict recommendation to try to be here as much as possible because I mean one of

204
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,960
the insights from the corona crisis, yeah, when you watch remotely, sometimes it's

205
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,120
hard to maintain discipline. I also recognize that with all kinds of Zoom meetings

206
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:53,920
and Zoom. I don't know, seven hours. So having a habit of coming to VDB, coming to class,

207
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,400
I think it's also a way to stay connected, but I don't know to the course content, but also to one

208
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:07,200
another. So you could fall back on this, but I would not recommend a full digital semester in any case.

209
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,480
So, but it's there and it will be your resource.

210
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
It all goes well at the very end.

211
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,960
So, yeah, we're here.

212
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,960
A bit more on the discussion seminar.

213
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,400
So, yes, please, there was a question.

214
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,240
(indistinct)

215
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,720
Yeah, it's to have some slack in this room.

216
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
We'll aim for two hours,

217
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,480
But we already started like five minutes late today.

218
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,040
So don't be upset if we take until 10 past seven.

219
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,800
But the idea is that it would be two hours.

220
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,720
Yeah, depends if the tone on what happens.

221
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,240
Yes?

222
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,720
[INAUDIBLE]

223
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,240
Excuse me?

224
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,720
Sorry.

225
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,760
[INAUDIBLE]

226
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,120
Yes, I'll post them online after each session.

227
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,240
Yeah, and if you go to the GUMVA stage and I guess some of you are not yet

228
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:15,720
be able to access convos that should be resorted quite soon. You'll see at the starting page

229
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,200
I made all kinds of modules as a kind of an outline module and there's a module per session

230
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,080
where you'll see

231
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,680
the required readings, some additional readings,

232
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,320
I'll post a link to, you know, I won't do it there.

233
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,120
I'll post a link to the recordings and the announcements.

234
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,720
There will be session slides linked to each of these modules.

235
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,920
So, I mean, I think it's neatly organized so you should find your way there.

236
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,120
Basically, all content will be provided online for people that cannot access

237
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:02,120
convos yet. Please find somebody who has access and try to share, I would say the course outline.

238
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:09,480
So please be aware that some of you don't have access yet. I think by next week it should be

239
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:19,880
okay. So yeah, let's see. So yeah, next in the lectures there's discussion seminars where we

240
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:27,720
basically use the reader to advance our insight into these discussions around urban geography.

241
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,680
And we take the various modules, so four modules, and we organize that in one block,

242
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,280
where we'll have a discussion which is basically prepared by you all in different kind of

243
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:44,360
smaller presentations, and then we have a collective discussion about that. It's also in the

244
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,960
an outline. So it's a different kind of series of discussion seminars because you can't

245
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:56,480
have a debate with 200 people in the room. So it's more like a classroom format, one

246
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,360
for the master in urban studies, one track for four cities, and then also one for geography

247
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:09,080
first and urbanists in one go. For must and for cities, it won't be on Mondays, it's

248
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,760
some different times during the week.

249
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,960
It's in your time schedule.

250
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,320
Please check if you've already identified

251
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
where the time schedule is.

252
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,480
Also where the week information is.

253
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,400
And try to notice down in your agenda,

254
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,720
because there will be an assignment later that, a small one.

255
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,080
But I would say an important one.

256
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,840
Please note that down in your agenda.

257
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Also note that the lectures at some point will have three lectures now, but then we will skip one week before we go to the next module, then two classes, then we skip one week, etc, etc.

258
00:18:49,160 --> 00:19:02,160
And it is because on certain Mondays after module will have a discussion seminar with geographers and urbanists because it's, we can't expect work students to be here during the day.

259
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,460
So we will take these Mondays and also please take notes for

260
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:13,860
most enforcities that you don't have to show up for, I would say, four sessions

261
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,040
on Mondays. I mean you're welcome to join, but there will be no lectures, there

262
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,440
will be discussion seminars for a not a group, okay? Just so you know, it could be a

263
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,600
week also to prepare another bit more for the discussion seminar that you

264
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,200
you may have yourself. Okay, I'll say more about the assignment linked to that in

265
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,120
seconds. Then urban social geography excursions, there's a lot of administration here apparently.

266
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,160
We offer four excursions but because of the size of the group this is for must and for cities

267
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:56,160
will have to, yeah, force you to make a choice. So there's four excursions, one led by me,

268
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,280
and here in Brussels which the with Brussels has a global city.

269
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,120
Nick Schuetman takes you to enter to deal with issues of social and ethnic segregation.

270
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,680
Mind that this is a bike trip.

271
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:14,000
So maybe some of you are less comfortable with biking, just taking to account.

272
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,880
Others may be extremely experienced and fight the rates to slow and also don't want to join.

273
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:31,880
then there's an excursion to Shellrva again by Nick and then Voitek will take you on an excursion in Brussels around the team of everyday mobility.

274
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,880
So for excursions you have to choose to.

275
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,880
This is also something that I mentioned in this Google Sheets or Spectsheets.

276
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,480
try to go for one Brussels excursion and one other excursion because you want to kind of

277
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,240
give everybody opportunity to go beyond Brussels otherwise your remains stuck in the Brussels bubble.

278
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:04,120
So there's please select either and to a I would say or either shall it run. Yes.

279
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:12,520
The answer by trade is actually right how about the Wilfern-Rössen pointer? No. No.

280
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,800
- Okay, thank you, I'm gonna go by train.

281
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,760
And then I don't think it's even the entire day,

282
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,240
but at some point I'll go to the luck ball,

283
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,760
which is kind of a social housing product project

284
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,280
from I think the 60s, if I'm not mistaken,

285
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,720
and to reach that, you'll go by bike.

286
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,560
Yeah, some people feel less comfortable doing that.

287
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,680
You could also say we have one month to get trained.

288
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,160
And in the case, it could be an opportunity.

289
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,520
But take this into account.

290
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,020
Yes.

291
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,880
What was the question?

292
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,200
[INAUDIBLE]

293
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,840
No, no, no, no.

294
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,360
Yeah.

295
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,640
Well, there's a bike rental.

296
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,200
Yeah.

297
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,120
Nick has arranged bikes.

298
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,800
Are there any other questions about this?

299
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,280
Not yet.

300
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,960
No, but typically, I mean, this would be communicated.

301
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,760
They started in the early morning and the end at the end of the day.

302
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah, but it's a full day.

303
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,840
Same.

304
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,360
OK.

305
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,160
So please go to this spreadsheet and project

306
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:47,360
preferences. All right. Okay, I hope this the skills it. So fill out your preferences as soon as

307
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,320
possible and no later than next week. Okay, so there's limited capacity for each of these

308
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:03,840
versions so please take care of it. All right a bit more about the course materials

309
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:13,040
as you will see on Kungvas there's a reader which what I call required readings so I expect

310
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:20,320
everybody reads this at least once and preferably in advance of an advance of each lecture

311
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,480
It's kind of way to keep track of the discussion.

312
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,240
And there will also be additional readings.

313
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,840
And these additional readings will kind of be the resource that we will use in the discussion

314
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
so please.

315
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:42,120
Yeah, the rest I've said already, session slides and recordings available for each session.

316
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,840
And then this is weird.

317
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,920
And then you have access via conference.

318
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,400
A bit more about evaluation and great distribution.

319
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,280
So this assignment in this question seminar

320
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:05,200
is a critical summary and it accounts for one fifth of your total grade.

321
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,400
So it's a kind of a way to be remunerated if you will for your efforts during the semester.

322
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,240
But the whole idea is that we digest our way through the literature and through the

323
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,200
reader, that we do this in a collective way.

324
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,400
So what is the assignment?

325
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,360
All students have to read the required readings.

326
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:37,840
But then I have no idea what to do actually.

327
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Let me just check this is off.

328
00:24:44,840 --> 00:25:06,720
Okay, let's just try to continue.

329
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,960
So per two, you'll be invited to critically summarize one additional reading, so it could be

330
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,000
a paper on Baywood, for instance, when we're talking about global cities.

331
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,560
And yeah, I'll announce a schedule for that.

332
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,840
You'll have a ten minutes of presentation.

333
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,800
And what you're asked to do is that you focus on a core quote or passage or excerpt from

334
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,560
the text that you kind of use this as an introduction to the text that you tell us all about

335
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:46,040
the main argument of the authors, that you connect this to the wider debate or the literature

336
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,600
that we've been discussing, yeah, we've been talking about women in local cities.

337
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Yeah.

338
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,760
How do you connect this particular study that we're reading about?

339
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,360
And then toward the end, you want to give some kind of a critical reflection.

340
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
So you can also start with the critical reflection

341
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,160
and weave that through the entire presentation,

342
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,560
but you should end with a number of discussion questions

343
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,440
which we can then use to kickstart the debate.

344
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,040
So 10 minutes, you give kind of a crash or summary

345
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,000
of what the paper is about, why matters,

346
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,040
what we learn from it, and how we connect that

347
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,400
to the discussions that we're ready to have.

348
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,960
So that's the critical summary,

349
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,600
a bit more on that in a second.

350
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,600
We do have a presentation at home.

351
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Yes.

352
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
OK.

353
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Because otherwise it will be endless through a presentation.

354
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,600
It's something that you can do with too.

355
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,600
So yeah, it's both of you should take the floor at some point.

356
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,600
So there's a different balance exercise.

357
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,600
And also try to make this an integrated exercise,

358
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,600
not somebody, one person saying, OK,

359
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Okay, this is the argument, but then the other person not knowing the argument, but having come up with the neural fresh. So to give a stupid example, that's not the idea. So to really try to discuss and text together and come to some kind of a shared understanding there and already debating this amongst the two of you.

360
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,600
We will really be something worked while I think.

361
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Yeah, and then the largest part of the evaluation is a written exam.

362
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:31,600
And this is basically a way to test, you could say, your knowledge of urban,

363
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,600
of the urban theories and concepts that we've been discussing throughout the semester,

364
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
throughout different modules.

365
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,600
There's no particular focus on memorizing things by heart,

366
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:53,600
But it's about mobilizing your knowledge to study empirical examples cases, etc.

367
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,600
And I think we'll give examples of that throughout the course.

368
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:09,600
For instance, when you think about culture as an essay, say, urban development strategy,

369
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,720
We may get a question about this in you, santra, don't be due.

370
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,360
Santra can now be due next to the Brussels Canal Zone.

371
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,600
To what extent is this a case of cultural regeneration?

372
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,800
Discuss.

373
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,360
And then you would have to interpret the case on that base.

374
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,920
So it's not just about reproduction.

375
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
That's about applying what you've learned,

376
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,520
critically reflecting on the different concepts, etc.

377
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:47,520
And you'll use the readings, the slides, the recordings, personal notes from seminars and lectures.

378
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:59,520
And yeah, those who write on a disc of my excursion can also always refer to the filters to actually get a bit of more inspiration.

379
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,520
So that's the setup of the great distribution.

380
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,520
And yeah, a bit more still about this critical summary.

381
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Just a number of questions that you could use as a source of inter-age inspiration or a template.

382
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,520
So what is the key message from the paper?

383
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Why is it important? What is the key argument? What have you learned?

384
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,520
And really try to be as nuanced as possible.

385
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Can you compare the argument being made with other perspectives or perspective from the required readings or anything

386
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:47,520
[BLANK_AUDIO]

387
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
>> You have found important?

388
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,520
>> Yeah, this is going to be a real sound.

389
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
>> Yeah, I have no idea.

390
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:02,520
>> When I move, I have you pressure.

391
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Okay, let's try to continue.

392
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Yeah?

393
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Yeah.

394
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Okay.

395
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,520
I wonder what was happening.

396
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,520
I wonder what was happening.

397
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,520
We're seeing out in the background.

398
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,520
I think maybe, you know, it might sink in some of the stuff.

399
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Okay.

400
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,400
You're everything that would be the case?

401
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
And the appearance.

402
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Good everybody's supposed to have the phones.

403
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
It's definitely option.

404
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,400
It's like 100 phones being switched off. Is that possible to try?

405
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Yeah, but I don't really find it. I think it's necessary.

406
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:03,400
But yeah, I think that's what I can do actually.

407
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Maybe yeah, let's try. Okay, maybe you'll have to lift it or I can sort it out later.

408
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:26,440
later. What happens to break? Go this one.

409
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:55,440
[Music]

410
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,280
Let's see.

411
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Excuse me.

412
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,120
[INAUDIBLE]

413
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,560
And knowingly.

414
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,840
OK, I'm not a genius.

415
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,120
This is clear right now.

416
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,360
All right.

417
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,760
And then, yeah, final point that I already

418
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,680
said is try to think the debate.

419
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,720
That's what it's all about in the end.

420
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
OK?

421
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,480
[INAUDIBLE]

422
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,800
No, you have to do this once.

423
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,300
Yeah, so what I'll do is as soon as I have the full overview is who are actually taking this course, make a schedule.

424
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,000
And then you'll have to present once with somebody else.

425
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,500
Yeah.

426
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:54,600
It's not on canvas. It's a different kind of Google sheets, but you can click the link in the slides that I just showed.

427
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,360
So, when you're a little bit different.

428
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,040
Yeah.

429
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,120
But that, those who don't have access to come

430
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:09,120
for us may be asked somebody who has to share this link

431
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,880
or just ask somebody to sign you up via this link.

432
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,480
OK.

433
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,720
Is that clear?

434
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,640
Was there a whole lot of administration

435
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,600
sorry for that?

436
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,160
But that's how it goes, I guess.

437
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,320
So I hope everything is clear. Yes, please.

438
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:37,720
Yeah, but I'll make the distribution.

439
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,680
Yeah, because otherwise if we do this bottom up, then

440
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,000
it will be very, very difficult.

441
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,520
So well, yeah, but all texts are interesting, I would say.

442
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,640
So that's the idea.

443
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,680
But it might take a while because I think for most enforceities

444
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,840
quite clear.

445
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,000
So that could go fast.

446
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,980
Maybe for geographers and staff, it

447
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,000
could last a little bit longer because sometimes it's unclear

448
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
who is actually in the course.

449
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,520
But for most enforceities, I think this

450
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,160
can go actually quite fast.

451
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,960
And then you can also plan a little bit working semester.

452
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,480
OK.

453
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,400
All right.

454
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,120
So let's turn to some content then.

455
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,680
And let's start a trip.

456
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,440
What we'll be discussing in earnest today

457
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,280
is basically what we'll do is we'll deconstruct the title

458
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,800
course and ask for questions.

459
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,040
What is the urban?

460
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,240
What is the city?

461
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,320
What is geography?

462
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,280
And what does it mean when I say I'm critical?

463
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,080
Arguably critical is not in the title,

464
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,720
but it could have been.

465
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,120
It may seem nonsensical, but I think asking these very

466
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,320
blue sky questions perhaps could get us

467
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,320
closer to what understanding what urban geography is about.

468
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,120
So you can also start already starting

469
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,840
a little bit about what we would mean

470
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,640
in the term the urban and the city.

471
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,400
And maybe as I take you to a number of exhibits,

472
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,120
you can draw some inspiration for that,

473
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,560
and you can make a list.

474
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,000
And then in a few minutes, you'll

475
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,920
be invited to write a very short, one-minute paper.

476
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,000
It doesn't have to be pros, where you collect

477
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,080
a little bit of ideas on what those two terms put me.

478
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,760
Let's get started a bit.

479
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,100
You probably, and one of the reasons,

480
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,660
why some of you have studies,

481
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,660
was selected the Muslim urban studies or four cities,

482
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:55,140
is because you have been seduced by a discourse

483
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,500
or a frame of relief in the urban age,

484
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,380
processes occur increasingly in cities,

485
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,300
therefore we need to understand cities

486
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,780
if we want to make sense of our futures,

487
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,420
or something like that.

488
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,780
And this would be some kind of a framework or repertoire

489
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,780
That's the world that the United Nations

490
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,780
sorry calls a framework of the urban age.

491
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,780
And it's a kind of frame that says,

492
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,780
well, we've long been a, you could say,

493
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,780
rural global population or rural species.

494
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,780
But at some point,

495
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
and someday in 2005,

496
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,780
we became an urban species and ever since,

497
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,780
basically rural population growth

498
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,580
will be urban growth.

499
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,780
So increasingly, we're undergoing

500
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,140
as a global society of growth, of urbanization,

501
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,140
where more and more people become urban.

502
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,180
So this kind of mantra of the urban age

503
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,220
has been around since about 2007,

504
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,580
so immediately after this historical urban transition.

505
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,980
And it has been repeated as a kind of a motivation

506
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,700
for increased attention to cities.

507
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:18,700
So, and there's something behind that obviously because there is indeed a transition to the urban and it's observable here in Berkeley.

508
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Roughly in the 1950s, about 70% of the population global population lived in rural areas and only 30% in urban areas.

509
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:39,740
It was 50/50 apparently around 2005 and now it's reversed or it's going to be reversed by 2050.

510
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,620
Expectation is that 70% of the global population will live in cities.

511
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:53,820
So that's kind of the framework of the urban age that is very much projected by

512
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,820
by United Nations, by all kinds of world reports,

513
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,980
and that is kind of taken over by both critical

514
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,740
and more uncritical voices and debate.

515
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,420
McKinsey would also use this to argue for more consultancy

516
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,580
into urban governance.

517
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:19,700
But just as much like Davis, when it talks about cities

518
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:28,380
slums, it uses as a critical framework to make his work in court.

519
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:36,820
So what is behind this is an assumed process or an identifiable process of globalized urbanization.

520
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:44,700
So the process by which the urban condition, if you will, is becoming a global phenomenon.

521
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,700
urbanization used to be something that was not global at all.

522
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:59,380
And if you look at a few maps by Michael Pachoning, has a great handbook on cities.

523
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:06,140
You see that it was very much, say, a Western European or Northern American affair.

524
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:16,300
So UK was extremely urbanized, European continent, also quite and US as well.

525
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:21,500
Apparently, a lost color is also extremely urbanized.

526
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:27,500
The rest of the world was on the map, but not really on the map of urbanization.

527
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,580
It didn't occur there.

528
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,580
Bam.

529
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:37,780
forward to the 1950s you see that this process is spreading, especially you could say throughout

530
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:44,340
your being continents, throughout the Commonwealth, you see Australia and kind of popping up

531
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:56,420
also you could say more developed mentalists say in Latin America, USSR and to a very very limited extent

532
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:06,420
Africa and then especially the market. Not so much in Asia as you can see. We're moving forward

533
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:16,660
in 1990s. We see that this process is both extending geographically and intensified. So a lot of

534
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:23,140
countries or quite a few countries in Europe have now an urbanization rate, apparently between 80

535
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:30,500
and 100%, which is kind of the ratio between population that lives in cities on the total population.

536
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:36,740
So between 80 and 100% of people live in cities according to these definitions.

537
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:45,780
Again, note Australia, it's a tremendously organized continent, if you will.

538
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,340
Obviously this is a projection of the ratio on the entire territory.

539
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,340
Okay, so almost all Australians live in cities,

540
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,940
but that doesn't mean that the entirety of Australia is a city.

541
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,140
Maps could lie, some extent.

542
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,540
So we may be exaggerating some things when we think about

543
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:13,940
the use of natural resources or environmental impact.

544
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,840
That's something that we could think about.

545
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,100
What is also important is kind of a different kind of figure,

546
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,660
is that there's some kind of a decoupling

547
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,580
between processes of one of the better words,

548
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,700
economic growth or what some people call

549
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,340
more problematic development and urbanization.

550
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,500
When you go back to say the history of urbanization

551
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,060
in the 19th century, it was a process that was intimately

552
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,100
linked to industrialization, economic growth,

553
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,860
But also obviously as we know, uneven development within West

554
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,660
New York being cities.

555
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,060
There was a lot of economic development in the UK.

556
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,180
Cities like Manchester, because there was a group of the textile

557
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,220
industry that led to economic growth.

558
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,300
But it also led to huge urban inequalities.

559
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,860
But in any case, at the aggregate level,

560
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,180
you could say, at the level of the country,

561
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,180
or the city, there wasn't an economic improvement.

562
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,580
and that's connected to the growth of these cities.

563
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,200
What you find in, you could say, the last 20 years

564
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,340
and this has something to do with all kinds

565
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,540
of neoliberal policies that work at the global scale,

566
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,980
especially when you talk about Asia and Africa.

567
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,780
You could say the strategic adjustment plans

568
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,700
that have been rolled out there by organizations such as

569
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,700
the International Monetary Fund

570
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,700
and it's a sister of brother, the World Bank,

571
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,300
which has basically opened up the borders

572
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,340
of these countries before an investment

573
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,180
as this which kickstart growth, okay?

574
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,740
In reality, one could argue that this has produced

575
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,180
a dependent form of growth,

576
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,460
or it's an exploitative relation

577
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,180
between the global periphery and the global core, okay?

578
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,780
But at the same time has initiated

579
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,660
and this is kind of the argument by my Davis,

580
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,060
an implosion of the countryside, rural living

581
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:24,260
in these places became untenable

582
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,980
because a lot of, say, subsidized activities

583
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,660
or state controlled activities were rolled back,

584
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,460
for instance, in agriculture.

585
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,660
This led to huge deprivation on the countryside

586
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,500
and in varying degrees, a search to grow

587
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,740
for the better life and a lot of African neutrides.

588
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,740
So if we told that it could be a sign of economic development,

589
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,740
you could say in the 19th century, and even if we take up

590
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,740
with a pinch of salt, that's still not possible to say in when you talk

591
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,740
about urbanization rates, for instance, in Africa, or parts of Asia.

592
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,740
Okay.

593
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:08,740
Now, so, and if you look at the rates of urbanization,

594
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:15,900
We're talking about 7% to 8% in some sub-Saharan African countries, whereas if you look at

595
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:23,620
older industrial areas or urbanized areas, it's somewhere between 1% and 2% still growth.

596
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:30,580
So with doubling, I would say in 36 years, if it's 2%, but far far less.

597
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:37,860
So yes, globalized urbanization that also shows, and then you look at the

598
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:47,940
list of largest cities. It was very much Euro-American if you will. The industrial

599
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:57,100
hard-life, hard-lands, some exceptions Shanghai for instance, Japan, 1950s. But then it

600
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:07,340
It starts to really diversify and become actually a matter of not Euro-America, but Asia, Latin

601
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:14,040
America, and a number of leading cities in terms of population in the 1950s, and now well

602
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,820
down the list, take New York, for instance, others.

603
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:23,460
So this kind of thesis that urbanization is now a globalized phenomenon.

604
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,460
There are still different kinds of patterns behind that.

605
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:34,460
Just you can look into this at home because it may be a bit small to actually read here.

606
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:41,460
Some places when you look at Europe, we're talking about 80% urbanization.

607
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:47,460
Still in Africa despite its large urbanization rate,

608
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,460
still for most rural society.

609
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:57,260
So even despite the kind of a global transition toward globalized urbanization,

610
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,860
there's quite a bit of regional differences that we need to take into account.

611
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,460
And that brings me to the next slide.

612
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,460
This famous image that I stole it from Neil Brenner,

613
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:18,860
where Batman beats the crap out of Robin because he begins to talk about this urban age again.

614
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:26,220
I think it's a moment to really question critically what is meant by the urban ancient, to

615
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:31,500
what extent we should really believe and go along in this urban age frame.

616
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,340
And a very nice paper I haven't put it in the reader because there's already quite a

617
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:39,340
bit of things in there.

618
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:47,060
Is the paper by Neil Brenner and Christian Smith from 2014 and they really deconstruct this

619
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:55,780
narrative and they pointed to elements. One is the notion or the idea or the

620
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,380
observation that we're living in the urban age could be a statistical

621
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:06,260
artifact. So it's a matter of how we measure things and there's actually quite a

622
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:14,180
bit of divergence over time but also across countries as to how a city is

623
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:24,980
actually measured. In some contexts there's a city, something counts as a city as of 1,000 inhabitants.

624
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:33,380
In other countries it would be 10,000 and it would have a tremendous impact on how we calculate the urbanization.

625
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:43,340
So this is more fundamentally what an argument is that there's a huge nationalist bias in how the urban

626
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,460
is defined.

627
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,940
I'm not saying that there's 200 definitions,

628
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:53,700
but for instance, when you look at the work of organizations

629
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,980
like United Nations, they have been struggling

630
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:01,500
to set a standard definition of what the urban is.

631
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,220
There's still quite a bit of diversity.

632
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,300
And when you look at the work of urban geographers

633
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,940
for the past 50 or 60 years, this is a kind of recurring issue.

634
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:15,940
So what they say is that, yes, there are real empirical caps

635
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,540
knowledge here of the rate of urbanization.

636
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:24,700
And therefore, it's almost meaningless to say

637
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,380
in some day, in 2005, we became more urban,

638
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,300
I'll repine now our urban species.

639
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,740
So it's kind of, yes, there's a broad trajectory

640
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:40,700
toward urbanization, but there's a very large bandwidth

641
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,700
that we should consider.

642
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:48,940
And in fact, it could be more interesting to look at different kind of urbanization trajectories

643
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:54,140
because it's dealing with all kinds of different processes that need to be studied as

644
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,860
historically unfolding

645
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:00,420
rather just than being captured in a figure of

646
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:05,500
75% for it. So it's more of an invitation. It's not looking at it.

647
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,700
So there's also connects to the second argument is that

648
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:18,040
The urban, as it is being measured by a process of urbanization, is so much of a chaotic

649
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,580
abstraction.

650
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:27,780
It means that different kind of things that are not necessarily related are packed together

651
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,700
to define a certain process.

652
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,820
And this is something that, for instance, a new Brenner and Christmas month have also worked

653
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:42,820
on later as the discussion of planetary urbanization, I invite you to look into that debate.

654
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:49,340
Their argument is that the urban, in fact, as a condition, as a way of life, or as a system

655
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:56,940
of production or exploitation does not neatly overlay actual morphologies of cities.

656
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:06,900
So the urban may have nothing to do with a concentrated blob of people in space or with

657
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,340
sitting within a particular jurisdiction.

658
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,900
It could be connected to suburbs, et cetera.

659
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:19,220
So what they kind of are concerned with is when you talk about a race of urbanization,

660
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:26,820
is that you classify or categorize quite diverse ways of living into one category of

661
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:32,020
the urban and even more problematic.

662
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,300
So hence we don't really learn anything about it.

663
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,700
And what is even more problematic is that the rural is defined

664
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:43,060
as the non-urban and is nearby.

665
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,020
Yeah, not studied at all as kind of the left behind place,

666
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:50,540
that only exists in opposition to what really counts, which

667
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,820
is then the way forward, which is urban living.

668
00:50:53,820 --> 00:51:01,700
So that's kind of their argument, just to kick start a little bit to your thinking on this,

669
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:07,100

744

is that you have some combination of that

you might make my next slide completely redundant.

753
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:48,860
So yeah, one of the ideas and important say,

754
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,420
I mean with revolutionary, it's kind of a sensitivity

755
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,540
that the urban and citizens are not necessarily the same.

756
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:00,420
I think the point is not to say or to define clearly

757
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,620
what a city is or the urban is,

758
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,100
but to offer different kind of perspectives,

759
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:11,820
different kind of lenses on the question.

760
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,980
and by offering different kind of perspectives

761
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,220
or emerging from different kind of questions,

762
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,820
we may actually learn more about the process of urbanization.

763
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:25,540
So there's not kind of one ruling explanation,

764
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,580
but there's many ways of looking at it.

765
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,660
But I think, yeah, we'll get to something more.

766
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:37,660
So one idea is that it's about a concentration,

767
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:41,300
people, it's also about the concentration of stuff.

768
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,860
lump of material, the built environment.

769
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,700
Yeah, so it's something with density,

770
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,260
something else, so a lot of I think urbanists would recognize,

771
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,500
so it's the built environment, built up space

772
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,420
that really gives morphological signs that at some point

773
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,620
we have arrived in the city.

774
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:05,620
We at high rises be a lot of congestion

775
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,740
that would be markers of characteristics of folks.

776
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,620
So that's kind of not necessarily urban,

777
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:16,100
but kind of a marker of what is acid.

778
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,060
Then, stretching a little bit more into,

779
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,100
you can say the overlays between what is urban

780
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:28,160
and how it's deep borders, cities.

781
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:33,180
Cities are sometimes defined as the opposite

782
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:36,060
of the non-city, as I was saying,

783
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,460
as the opposite of the rural.

784
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,900
And then a number of planning context,

785
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,380
I'm thinking about, for instance, the Netherlands.

786
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,020
It will actually be, if you look at the satellite image,

787
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,740
it will be identifiable where one urban area ends

788
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,980
and there's country side and then something else starts.

789
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:58,380
But yeah, in many contexts,

790
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,820
especially in the lavish one, for instance,

791
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,460
this is a reality where you won't get really far.

792
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:07,620
It's kind of, you're not sure where the city ends.

793
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:12,620

794

01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,780

outside of the core areas of urban agglomerations.

799
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:34,180

of activities and suburbs.

01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:49,100
it generates all kinds of fuzzy categories.

We haven't covered this yet, so maybe we're talking about this.

809
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:34,180
So it's, yeah, the urban or a city is the place of an urban life, but perhaps the urban

810
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:37,980
also stretches beyond the city itself.

811
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:42,620
So urban living could also be taking place in the suburbs.

812
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:50,780
But it's some kind of an idea that within the spaces, a different kind of society and

813
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:56,460
in a different kind of behavior, norms, values, and take place.

814
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:03,740
So it's a distinctive way of life, but still it could be a very different kind of energy

815
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:11,100
that we may be talking about or a different kind of bonds that actually ties people together.

816
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:14,980
So just compare slum living with loft living.

817
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:22,740
It's a very distinct way of urban living, but they both be characterized as something else

818
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,940
than rural living.

819
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:30,460
So and there's this big debate, I would say, in urban sociology, between what is now

820
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:36,940
distinct about the urban way of life at a some kind of an assumption that you move from

821
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,460
community to society.

822
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:45,260
communities think about rural communities where you have all kinds of personal relations

823
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:49,460
with neighbors, small villages.

824
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:55,940
And this gets formalized and nullomized as soon as you get to cities because distances become

825
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:00,700
larger because there's all kinds of institutional roles.

826
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:04,100
There's a division of labor that we'll get to in a second.

827
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,460
And it becomes more abstract.

828
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:12,540
take a certain function within society which is less mediated by social relations. That was kind

829
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:19,180
of the argument by a lot of sociologists also in the 19th century that try to capture the process

830
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:25,820
of urbanization. So it's a distinctive way of life. It's not just buildings and homes of material.

831
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:33,660
It's more than that. Another way of looking at it and with Hintonad, by you here at Front,

832
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:38,660
It's also about economic relations that tie together people.

833
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:44,660
I think about flows of energy, flows of work, flows of ideas,

834
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:50,860
flows of data that connects the inhabitants of a certain place.

835
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:56,260
And it would be more agglomerated in some places than others,

836
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:59,460
but they wouldn't be necessarily confined to,

837
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,460
you could say, the core of metropolitan areas.

838
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:31,860
So the city is also the place where divisions of labour emerge and there's this famous picture by Adam Smith's needle factory or pin factory, where cities are kind of a microcosm of a workshop where different kind of tasks that used to be integrated in thin making are kind of cut up and collectively places produce a certain economic problem.

839
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:41,860
So this inputs needed by different suppliers, different kind of specialized workers to end up with a product.

840
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:51,860
So historically that has been a way where open elites could emerge that could also kind of manage this process,

841
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:58,860
that could also absorb part of the surplus that was being generated by a more efficient

842
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:04,860
division of labor, standardization of work, for instance, and was also, you can say,

843
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:12,860
a more critical framework of the place where uneven development and urban inequalities actually have their origins.

844
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:19,860
So it produced more efficiency, it increased the urban surplus, if you will, but not everybody benefited.

845
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:24,860
So a complex division of labor, the idea that there are

846
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:29,860
agglomeration effects by being in a certain place,

847
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,860
economic agents for instance, will benefit from their presence

848
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,860
because they have specialized inputs.

849
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:41,860
That's kind of the realm of economic geographies that try to capture

850
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,860
that process.

851
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:47,860
And now obviously when you talk about divisions of labor,

852
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,400
about these energies that go around,

853
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,360
these also structure urban spaces

854
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,780
and you could say urban class relations

855
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:58,420
in a particular way.

856
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:03,420
So you could apply some kind of regulations perspective here

857
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,620
thinking about,

858
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:11,140
we could say different eras of cities

859
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:16,260
as being engaged in particular production processes,

860
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:23,380
recapitalist cities, for instance, the top left, then the typical newly industrializing

861
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:29,500
cities top right, then going bottom left to 40 cities.

862
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:35,220
And then you could say contemporary cities that are kind of both exploded and imploded

863
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,860
at the same time with rising densities at the edges.

864
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:44,100
And also a re-entensification of built up areas in the very core and return of activities

865
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,100
there.

866
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:50,500
a regular regulation perspective is also what Dorian Massey

867
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,460
would be talking about.

868
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:55,060
She was a famous economic geographer,

869
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,500
economic geographer from 1980s.

870
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,220
She was also one of the main critical voices

871
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:04,620
and trying to understand how particular forms of capitalism

872
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:08,500
leave their imprint on society in general

873
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,180
and on urban societies in particular.

874
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:12,580
She was interested in regions, but it also

875
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,820
can be applied to cities.

876
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,420
So yeah, you had a really very high rock

877
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,300
go to society in general.

878
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,300
I mean, there's a huge generalization here

879
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,020
in medieval cities where the core wasn't

880
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:29,780
elite realm with some domestic servants.

881
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,300
Then there was a kind of a layer of the lower classes,

882
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,460
and then basically the outcomes with a number

883
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,540
of ethnic communities.

884
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:40,300
This is a huge generalization, but it's kind of a guiding

885
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,140
model that is it's set to hold.

886
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,700
When you think about industrializing cities,

887
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:50,780
it was kind of thing and this is Chicago for sure.

888
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:55,180
I will be talking a bit more about Chicago as it became a model

889
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:58,940
of the industrial city in the early 20th century.

890
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:02,460
A lot of industrial activity in the commercial

891
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:07,580
part of the city and then radiating out

892
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,820
in terms of, you could say, class,

893
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,420
his working man's houses and then further on,

894
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,820
more elite cities, people, neighborhoods, people

895
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,860
that could actually afford to commute to the city set.

896
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:24,020
Then after the second world tour,

897
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,700
actually, like at the bottom left,

898
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,940
it's kind of a gorgeous city where capitalism was

899
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,020
regulated in a particular way,

900
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:34,340
where the surplus that was being created

901
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,540
by capitalist production, think about all these factories

902
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:41,300
Mass production was being shared by the working class.

903
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:44,220
So this is kind of a typical American dream.

904
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,660
It can provide the American cities,

905
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,700
but friends also can provide European cities

906
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:52,420
where we had a massive round of serverization,

907
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,060
the good life where you could live far removed

908
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:00,500
from where you were, commute by car,

909
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,700
and it was a way to kind of spatially redistribute

910
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,340
the surface that was being generated in cities.

911
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:12,060
And that's a kind of a Harvey and David Harvey interpretation

912
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,580
of suburbanization.

913
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,500
It's not just a lifestyle.

914
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,740
It's also a spatial form of how capitalism

915
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:22,420
of in that period worked.

916
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:26,780
And then kind of finally, this kind of growth

917
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,100
at the periphery.

918
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,300
We see a kind of an outward movement,

919
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,300
you can see the urbanization of suburbanism.

920
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:36,180
All kinds of knowledge and densities

921
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,740
and then starting to take place at the edges,

922
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:44,100
all of city centers that are losing functions,

923
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,740
this kind of historical process in the 70s and 80s,

924
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:49,860
lot of derelict areas, ground food areas,

925
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:52,540
which are then in subsequent decades,

926
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:55,780
increasingly becoming the places where you have waves

927
01:09:55,780 --> 01:10:00,060
of gentrification, a return of capital to city centers,

928
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,060
et cetera, et cetera.

929
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:06,140
And admit all this, and I'm trying to hugely summarize

930
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,140
and generalized here, because it's

931
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,340
a kind of ideal typical approach, diversity that

932
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,820
is increasing in a lot of cities,

933
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:20,540
new pockets of exclusiveness and exclusion

934
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,300
on the other hand.

935
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:25,460
So cities also becoming increasingly polarized.

936
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:29,500
So the urban is different depending

937
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,420
on the period you're talking about.

938
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,180
It could be characterized differently,

939
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:42,180
depending on where you are and in what period you're talking about.

940
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:53,420
Bottom left and right? Yeah, you could say that. I mean, in some handbooks it would be called

941
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:59,900
the Fortis City, this one. And this would be the post-40 city, which is exactly the

942
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:05,900
This is not one identifiable core in the metropolitan area.

943
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:11,900
Whereas this was still very much in relation to the core, but it captures different.

944
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,900
You could call it modernity.

945
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:22,900
Yes, but that would more refer to, you could say, a discussion of planning approaches,

946
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:28,900
modernist planning for instance, where it was okay, we're going to organize the city in zones.

947
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:35,300
zones, here is residential function, here we have industrial function. But you're right,

948
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:43,620
and that's in the 40s city. It was at a larger scale managed like that. There was also

949
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:53,140
where a lot of urbanist counter-reaction was launched against later on. Think about figure of

950
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:59,780
Jane Jacobs, who basically said, well, with modernist planning this hand, there's a top-down

951
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:05,140
approach. It doesn't have anything to do with urban life in an obvious own. So we have to take

952
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:10,660
stock of that, just thinking about a different way of planning. So modernism would be a marker,

953
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:16,900
I would say, of, again, yeah, of urban society, but also about planning traditions that have

954
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:25,860
produced before the city. And then another way and this was really mentioned is

955
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:34,340
yeah the urban or the city is also kind of a projector of symbol at power. It sends a message

956
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:42,180
to the world and this is becoming I mean goes back to the 12th and the 13th century where

957
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:50,820
the legal cities and flowers had the highest, wanted to have the highest building or some

958
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:57,940
zoom in the other in the 14th century and northern Italy had something to do with corporate power,

959
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:04,820
the merchant power, and also showing the liberties of cities vis-a-vis territorial states,

960
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:10,580
which were then still feudal states and the Middle Ages. You see that this is becoming much more

961
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:16,740
globalized and that's the content of these messages is also very diverse. You have the CCTV

962
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:23,620
building on Beijing, which is some kind of a representation of, you can say, the authoritarian power

963
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:32,420
of the Chinese central state over China, but also, et cetera, totally, there's the World Trade Center.

964
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:37,140
Yeah, I don't think we need to deconstruct that.

965
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:42,740
And in there's a lot of images, I mean about a claim

966
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:47,540
imperialism by the US, which was vested in the commercial

967
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:52,660
interests or the commercial power of the US,

968
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:58,260
which then also became a symbol of oppression, if you will,

969
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:04,580
and made it a target for attacks as we all know.

970
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:12,140
So it's a highly contested or arbitrary symbol there.

971
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:17,700
And often it's also kind of used in spectacular developments,

972
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:23,820
you could say, Putska Lifa in the Middle East and Dubai.

973
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:28,220
It's kind of a part of a wider process of, say,

974
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:34,620
supply side economics where it's really about building capacity, building state-of-the-art

975
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:39,580
infrastructure, with the idea that it built a strong business, another bill in the end,

976
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:49,900
drive growth. Dubai, an emerald without oil, oil has run out since the 60s, has had this

977
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:55,500
diversification strategy, and it has been to some extent a kind of self-fitting prophecy.

978
01:14:56,380 --> 01:15:02,700
So yeah, it's kind of a token of importance of centrality that has been proclaimed there.

979
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:10,060
It also is a token of all the things, a huge exploitation of temporary labor, for instance,

980
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:15,820
but that is typically the dark side of these kind of buildings that is less discussed.

981
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:22,940
So, far the spectacular urbanism makes us wonder what is behind this image.

982
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:29,500
So yeah, symbolic power is also kind of projected by certain kind of cities.

983
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:36,940
And then maybe a final definition is in the atmosphere definition.

984
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:43,900
It has a certain jurisdiction within a country.

985
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:49,100
It's the way where all kinds of management processes are administered for the population,

986
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:53,100
a service, but it had a public sector organized itself.

987
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:59,100
What is kind of interesting is that there's a lot of historical

988
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:05,100
and yeah, aberrations almost when you take, for instance, the example

989
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:11,100
of Miesen and West Flanders. I put an arrow there, but there's a

990
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:15,100
Belgian that well. It has about 1,000 population,

991
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,100
In 2019, but it counts as a city.

992
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,100
So it's kind of a historical artifact.

993
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:28,100
It used to be a very important trading center for broad cloth,

994
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:36,100
if you've ever been to Grüch, that was kind of the main kind of produce that was kind of traded there.

995
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:39,100
Grüch is what's 40,000 a day at that time.

996
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:44,100
So a fifth of the size of world city, Grüch is, I think the 13th century.

997
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:50,900
So what is a very small community now was there and then an important city and somehow

998
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:58,580
missing has kept city rights and would still count as a city in UN language.

999
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:06,980
Okay, so just to show that we should probably be very very about these classifications because

1000
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:10,180
they can be quite misleading.

1001
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:11,020
Okay.

1002
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:11,860
- Thank you.

1003
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:12,700
- Yeah.

1004
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:13,820
- One thing that's not like trying to get it out

1005
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:16,180
for the clinical care of the

1006
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,940
and the other, it's only the amount of the number

1007
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:20,340
of people living there or.

1008
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,180
- That's a good question.

1009
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,100
I don't know it by heart,

1010
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:27,180
but there would be a combination of many things

1011
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:30,300
that would be indeed size of the population.

1012
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:35,300
I think we have more morphological characteristics.

1013
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:42,300
typically it would be continuous built up areas.

1014
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:47,140
And then included in that,

1015
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:51,980
some definition of a percentage of people commuting

1016
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,300
to the poor city.

1017
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:57,620
So areas that are still dependent on the poor city

1018
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,820
because they're part of an integrated labor market.

1019
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:02,180
So I don't know it by heart,

1020
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,580
but there's kind of the agglomeration

1021
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,900
and then the bond here, which just gives a kind of an arbitrary

1022
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,340
of that.

1023
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:15,300
And that's basically what they call functional urban areas.

1024
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,380
That's the kind of definition that is

1025
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,980
practical, which gives you.

1026
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:23,220
The thing that you can also say is that you have to

1027
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,260
point--

1028
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,620
because I know what they need to tell what my

1029
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:28,340
friend is that there is a decision in

1030
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,820
everybody else who writes.

1031
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,180
So maybe they just never requested

1032
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,180
Anyway, it didn't.

1033
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:35,180
It did.

1034
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:35,180
It did.

1035
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:37,180
Well, back in the H.F.

1036
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,180
Yeah.

1037
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,180
Yeah.

1038
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,180
I think that that couldn't be--

1039
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,180
I don't know the ins and outs of that.

1040
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:46,180
But I think in Utah it could be part of the process as well.

1041
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,180
Yeah.

1042
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,180
[INAUDIBLE]

1043
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:52,180
We just look at our information.

1044
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:54,180
[INAUDIBLE]

1045
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:55,180
Yeah.

1046
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:57,780
They tried to come up with some kind of standardization

1047
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,500
on the criteria that I was mentioning.

1048
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:05,020
So how many people live there, more logical continuity,

1049
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:08,300
and then you could say economic relations.

1050
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,940
But especially with the population threshold,

1051
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,300
there's a huge dedication.

1052
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,700
Some countries would be 1,000, and others would be 10,000.

1053
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,140
It would be very good.

1054
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:26,260
I think they do because Belgium does.

1055
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:28,300
So that's kind of the irony.

1056
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:33,580
And that gets lost in when you look at the urbanization rates of 200 plus countries,

1057
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:40,140
you count the candidate. But the point by by Brennan instrument is that even if you solve that

1058
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:45,420
and come to a standardized definition, you're still not out of the woods because it could still

1059
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:52,860
create all kinds of chaotic conceptions because the burden is not the same as the city.

1060
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:56,700
Okay, so that was kind of what's the point, okay.

1061
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,900
So I hope, yeah, there's a number of perspectives here.

1062
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:05,500
There's not one size fits all answer to what you heard

1063
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,300
in the city is, but there's different ways

1064
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,020
of approaching the theme, okay.

1065
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:18,900
Now, one definition that we could still use,

1066
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,420
And this is also one that is used in the hamburger

1067
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:25,620
because it's kind of very generically at the abstract level.

1068
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,060
It's obviously urbanization is the process

1069
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:30,300
of becoming urban.

1070
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,300
And it refers at the abstract level

1071
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:36,660
to demographic process where it increasingly people live

1072
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,500
in more and more density.

1073
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,900
Has something to do with a globalization

1074
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:46,140
of urban influence,

1075
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:52,220
be an economic, political, cultural, it's kind of these places that matter.

1076
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:58,140
And obviously this frame of the urban age is mobilized there.

1077
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:08,220
And it's a call for starting to look into how cities are connected to the wider process of urban development.

1078
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:13,780
And this is also connecting back to this notion of planetary urbanization by

1079
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:22,780
and the sense what they argue is that while cities may not populate the entire hurt,

1080
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:32,780
they're actually quite delineated still. If you produce a map, you can't say that the entire global map is urban.

1081
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:40,780
Maybe a lot of people live in cities, but still it wouldn't be a totality. Whereas the urban,

1082
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:49,280
as a process, as a way of living, as a system of capitalist production, would be almost a totality.

1083
01:21:49,280 --> 01:22:00,780
And in planetary urbanization, characters actually de facto even when you go as far as possible from the urban context, from cities.

1084
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:04,280
It would still lead back to these cities one way or another.

1085
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:08,640
So the exploitation of sea beds in the North Atlantic,

1086
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,760
it's absolutely not--

1087
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,920
has not the characteristics of cities,

1088
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,320
but it's part of an exploitation process

1089
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:22,760
that are commanded through cities.

1090
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:27,760
So it's an example of what they call extensive urbanization,

1091
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,640
whereas intensive urbanization in their mind

1092
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,720
would be the morphology of cities.

1093
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:40,080
So it's a kind of sociological imaginary of urbanization as it all leads back to cities

1094
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:46,320
and one way or another. Whereas a more geographical imagination would start with, well, we can still

1095
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:53,360
illuminate certain places as being more dense, being more common than one another, whereas we also

1096
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:59,520
have to see the connections with other things. So that's just one more approach of looking at it.

1097
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,360
We've been talking a little bit about urbanism because it's always a bit of confusion,

1098
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,120
difference between urbanization, which we've been talking about, and urbanism.

1099
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:16,240
We have urbanists here. It's not just about observing an analyzing process,

1100
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:24,160
also designing cities and shaping cities in a particular way. So, urbanism is

1101
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:34,080
the Métis is the craft of actually designing cities to a certain end.

1102
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:39,600
But it also connects to, and that's perhaps also what you were talking about at some point,

1103
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,520
gaining an urban attitude as something of an energy of that particular society in cities.

1104
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:53,040
It refers to a particular psychological or sociological feeling that gives a particular meaning

1105
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:59,280
to the space. And I already talked about the opposition between the ideal type of a community

1106
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:06,000
where there's kind of warm social ties kicking things together versus society where it's more

1107
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:14,240
abstract, warmer roles that are in personal. I think when you look at cities and the representations

1108
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:20,960
and the way the urban space is consumed, you find a lot of that, you could say societal

1109
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:30,160
anonymity or that kind of detached element in those images. And when you look at,

1110
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:35,520
yeah, especially in the 19th century, I mean, when people started to capture

1111
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:41,520
personal modernity, urban modernity, and it was this idea of the figure of the floner,

1112
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:48,560
which was at the same time, it was usually the handy, a rich person that was both connected to

1113
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,120
cities because of his wealth and he had to show himself of it at the same time. It was also a

1114
01:24:53,120 --> 01:25:00,880
spectator, a walker by Passon who consumed urban space from an enormous and detached way.

1115
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:06,160
And especially in the 19th century, we have this gallery here close to the Grand Plus

1116
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:13,760
in Brussels, it was a kind of urban space was designed for this anonymous consumption,

1117
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,600
was all about collective spectacular consumption. And in many ways urban design,

1118
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:28,560
especially when we started rebrand our city centres, goes back to these forms of urban consumption.

1119
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:36,480
If you think about these renderings of a unspark bouffard, or if you look at renderings of how

1120
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,280
It will look like in 10 years.

1121
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:44,280
It has this kind of spectacular element always to it.

1122
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:53,280
That's that project, a particular kind of urban attitude that is there to consume urban space.

1123
01:25:53,280 --> 01:26:01,280
So urban design, it's about, you're really giving shape to urban spaces,

1124
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:06,080
also capturing how people interact with psychologically

1125
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,600
and social education, with the built environment,

1126
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,720
especially with urbanism,

1127
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,320
poor-ferences, environmental psychology,

1128
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,480
and that is a very important team.

1129
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:24,960
Planning is a future oriented activity,

1130
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,880
which actors are very types engaged

1131
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,760
so that they can govern how development will take place.

1132
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:35,920
So obviously, economic process, society process,

1133
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,440
don't just unfold in and of themselves.

1134
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,080
It's a kind of process that being mediated

1135
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:43,800
by particular planning cultures,

1136
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,640
being we talked about zoning before.

1137
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,400
It's about giving a place to certain activities,

1138
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,760
making choices of where things should be developed.

1139
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,000
And it's actually quite a power-laden process

1140
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,720
because development in one place

1141
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,600
could mean non-development in another place.

1142
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,680
Where do jobs, where are jobs being created?

1143
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,400
Where do they not?

1144
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,480
And how do certain planning procedures

1145
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:13,000
try to tackle a process of uneven development

1146
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,040
or under development in the city?

1147
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,360
And especially in a city like Brussels, one of the main,

1148
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,400
you could say, folk of urban planning

1149
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,640
in the regional plan has been the canal.

1150
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:33,760
was kind of a prioritization space which needed to be redeveloped in one way.

1151
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:41,280
It will be looking into the social geography of this place and throughout the course with

1152
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:46,640
also as we go on excursions. It's an ethnically diverse, the lower income

1153
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:52,240
neighbourhood with a lot of unemployment and it's also very much a zone of transition.

1154
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,200
There's a lot of things happening there.

1155
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,040
Redevelopment and planning is not neutral there.

1156
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,280
There has been a large focus on this area,

1157
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:05,280
both in terms of trying to achieve industrial redevelopment,

1158
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,280
because there was a lot of unemployment

1159
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:12,440
kind of a rollout of the zone of economic expansion

1160
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,800
that was installed there.

1161
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:18,240
That at the same time also the ambition to achieve

1162
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:25,240
to increase the mixing of residential and working.

1163
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:41,240
And what is kind of interesting there in Brussels is that there was a very big contradiction between the ambition to attract businesses to this area and create jobs and the ambition of

1164
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:47,800
of mixity because mixity worked as a kind of an incentive for all of residential developers

1165
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:59,000
to start building high end or regionally unaffordable apartments, house, etc.

1166
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:08,120
So the idea of let's mix stuff is actually making the return of jobs to this area

1167
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:12,840
very difficult at least to forms of industrial gentrification.

1168
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:20,760
And it's also leading to some kind of affordability crisis because the types of houses that are

1169
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:26,600
being produced there has nothing to do with what the local residents would actually need.

1170
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:32,760
Okay, so there's housing production but it's not tailored to the to the demand if you will.

Okay, I think, I think this is all, I would say, correct in a way,

1223
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,200
but it shows that there's different, different answers to this question.

1224
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:57,200
And the answer to this question has been different throughout the history of geography.

1225
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:06,200
I would say in the 19th century it was indeed about creating detailed information on these sources to geography

1226
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:13,200
and those kind of things because geography was installed in an imperial program of exploiting the colonies.

1227
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:21,200
But throughout the decades the main purpose or as a result of geography has shifted.

1228
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:28,200
Or there's different kind of parallel interpretations of what the purpose of geography should be.

1229
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:33,200
I started a number of definitions where else do we go?

1230
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:39,200
The real, real geographical society, this is kind of the heart of empire, if you will.

1231
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:45,200
One of the first geographical societies, it's kind of part of the British empire,

1232
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:52,680
as it's a kind of root disease and it gives us some idea of what geography could be.

1233
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:57,680
So it's the understanding of social and physical processes within the context.

1234
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:03,080
Place recognizing the great differences in culture, political system, economies, landscapes and environments

1235
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,960
because the world and exploring things between.

1236
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:12,960
So it's about the world as a mosaic, it's about geographical difference, sensitivity to contexts.

1237
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:21,900
And also thinking relationally, so how does something that happens in Brussels connects to

1238
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,140
quincias operands?

1239
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:25,800
So it's about connections between places.

1240
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,600
So these are not, I mean, I'm not saying these are ideal definitions.

1241
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:35,760
By far not, but we can be inspired and take certain things from.

1242
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:40,800
American association of geographers used to be the association of American members by the way,

1243
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:47,800
that they changed their name to reflect more diverse audience in the community.

1244
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:52,800
You want to understand the world, I'm not start with the river, city, mountain and

1245
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,800
village erode and follow it to the ends of the earth.

1246
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:02,520
Chography asks the big questions, where, how, why, what if, as you were saying, and gives

1247
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:06,600
you the perspective to answer them with advanced technology and the solid knowledge of

1248
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,200
the world in which we all live.

1249
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:12,640
So follow your nose, trace connections,

1250
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,400
and indeed ask these big questions.

1251
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:22,920
Perhaps in other disciplines, there's less space to do so.

1252
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,000
By the way, if you go to the original,

1253
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,360
you could say literal Greek transcription

1254
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:31,040
is heard description.

1255
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,160
But that doesn't tell you that much, right?

1256
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:40,840
standard definition would be to describe human activity at the interface of

1257
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:47,040
with the Earth or something like that. So somehow goes back to a very

1258
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:53,360
descriptive idea of what geography should be not necessarily producing any

1259
01:36:53,360 --> 01:37:00,440
analytical knowledge or explanatory knowledge. So I tend to not to like that

1260
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:08,080
definition too much but in original Greek it's what I mean. Now to further a little

1261
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:13,840
bit there and I think I mean this is going a little bit more towards my own

1262
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:19,160
interpretation as well just another quote. Take from the handbook while most

1263
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:23,760
social science disciplines can be roughly defined by what they study the

1264
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,800
economy culture society and so on. Geography is defined by how is that so that

1265
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:32,920
was you were saying and then so the world by our approach. Geographers studied the

1266
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:38,040
economy's set of politics and culture too but a geographical perspective is one that emphasizes

1267
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:46,520
space and is supposed to any of these things. So it's not just that we can claim like political

1268
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:53,880
scientists or like economists this kind of thematic field. It's really our you could say theoretical

1269
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:58,760
and analytical working with the notion of space,

1270
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:03,680
space as something that explains what human activity

1271
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:10,360
as it interacts with its environment that really identifies.

1272
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:13,520
So sets us apart asographers from us.

1273
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,000
Yeah.

1274
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,200
Just to question the power system,

1275
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,600
the condition and any difference from,

1276
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,640
no, as you jump sociology as well.

1277
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:26,640
because there would be far less attention to space, I would say.

1278
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:32,640
So, Charles, the only isn't that space is also the final of human interactions.

1279
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:36,640
Like, the old one is showing.

1280
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:40,640
How space defines, how I wouldn't think so.

1281
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:46,640
I think sociologists would start with a particular history,

1282
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:54,480
histories perhaps, look at the relations, organizational forms, perhaps identity, those kind of processes

1283
01:38:54,480 --> 01:39:02,000
that I think, and they perhaps they may describe the variety across different contexts in one way

1284
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:10,880
or another, but perhaps they would not use geography to explain those differences. So, for instance,

1285
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,400
I mean, what could I think of as an example?

1286
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:20,040
I mean, when you try to understand urban life,

1287
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:23,840
being sensitive to how you're inserted

1288
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:30,280
in the global network of cities could be one way

1289
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:32,040
to appreciate your own positionality.

1290
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:35,320
So if you're a citizen of a city like in Shasta,

1291
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,760
which is an exploitative or subordinate relation

1292
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,600
to other cities in the world,

1293
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:46,560
Let me give you a hint of why your living conditions are that bad, whereas sociologist

1294
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:53,680
may perhaps start explaining that from local cultures, local society characteristics,

1295
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,440
political system, etc.

1296
01:39:55,440 --> 01:40:00,240
The geographer would, for instance, try to put that in perspective, say, look, there's

1297
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:06,880
a no-for-racking system, a world system of sorts, and maybe we can talk about this next

1298
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,880
week that allows to explain that a little bit better.

1299
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:23,880
Okay, but I think, yeah, and that connects a little bit to the next thing and the sociological imagination.

1300
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:30,880
And these are the words, I mean, this is what they've created, Harvey writes and social justice in the city.

1301
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:38,880
It enables the possess it when it stands the larger historical scene in terms of its meaning for in-a-life and external career of writing of individuals.

1302
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:44,880
For the sociological imagination enables us to grasp history and biography and relation between the two in society.

1303
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:49,880
So it's about think about issues like class and how knowledge is produced.

1304
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:55,960
what kind of questions that you ask that are predefined or not predefined by

1305
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:02,120
shaped by your own class identity differences or identity. To acknowledge that

1306
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:06,400
would be one thing. But Harvey says the spatial imagination enables the

1307
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:11,360
individual to recognize the role of space and place and so on biography. So take

1308
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:21,280
for instance somebody from South Africa who starts teaching in London as a

1309
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:28,000
geographer, how with this personal trajectory lead to some kind of a focus on

1310
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
issues of what is modernity, what is non-modernity, what is development, what is

1311
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,560
under development and those kinds of things. So how brings us a career as a

1312
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,440
to the global south, going to the global north,

1313
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:44,680
might shape the questions that are being asked.

1314
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:47,080
Next to just issues of class at Missity

1315
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:51,120
and other elements that may shape positionality.

1316
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:54,120
I could use the example of Jennifer Robinson, for instance,

1317
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,520
from the fitness exercise.

1318
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,680
And she came up with the idea of ordinary cities,

1319
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,480
somehow debunking the whole idea

1320
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,280
that would be extraordinary world cities,

1321
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,840
and then the rest, OK?

1322
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:10,280
So just saying that in your personal biographies,

1323
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:13,320
your spatial trajectory and your spatial relations

1324
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:16,520
with other places may also have an impact

1325
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:20,160
on the kind of questions that you're asking.

1326
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,720
I'm not saying that sociologists are blind,

1327
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:27,000
but they just ask different kind of questions.

1328
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,240
Okay.

1329
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:31,400
Now for me, I mean, these are difficult theoretical discussions

1330
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,480
and it's also not a epistemological, epistemology class,

1331
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:42,120
But I think it's safe to say that as human geographers were interested in the interactions

1332
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:49,080
between space and society, how spaces, shape societies and individuals and vice versa,

1333
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:53,720
how individuals and societies shaped their environments.

1334
01:42:53,720 --> 01:43:01,160
And this is kind of what, at so jump, a famous American job for a call, the social

1335
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:09,640
spatial dialectic. And then you translate that to cities. It's how urban societies make

1336
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:16,360
the places they live in. And at the same time, how urban space morphologically or otherwise

1337
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:21,880
has, again, back an influence on urban life as groups and individuals. Think about

1338
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:28,760
segregation, which shows a segregated social structure. It's something social, but also

1339
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:33,760
So will the fine kind of interactions that you have with others in driven space.

1340
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,560
And they have an impact on what kind of encounters you have in the city.

1341
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:46,000
They have an impact on how privileged you are to what extent you know other social groups

1342
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,160
and societies, etc.

1343
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:52,640
So space, one example that you're going to the work of Nikhil later on, that shows that

1344
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:59,240
space has in itself some kind of autonomous form of explanation. I'm very

1345
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:05,400
the friends as a job for as you can see because as all geographers I have an

1346
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:10,640
identity crisis but that's kind of a very productive one I would say because

1347
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:16,040
this kind of typifies the history of post-war history of geography. Maybe

1348
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:21,880
other geographers will recognize that. Yeah so the social spatial dialectic

1349
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:27,080
perhaps as a synthesis what we can land on our society's people,

1350
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:33,880
make spaces and how it works back to them. And thinking about the autonomous power of space

1351
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:45,240
and explaining stuff. As an example, if I can, can I? Yes. Four ways, I mean you mentioned already,

1352
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:49,640
it's thinking about different concepts of space, territory, scale, network,

1353
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:57,480
place or common ways of thinking about space. And we point to different kind of spatial processes.

1354
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:03,480
And again, it's not that one is better than the other to understand what is happening.

1355
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:10,520
But as I will try to show by the example of Brussels, it's kind of seeking tension between these

1356
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:16,760
different concepts that gets us a little bit closer to understanding, for instance, in this case,

1357
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:25,000
the conundrum that Brussels poses. So one way of looking at the city of Brussels is a territorial

1358
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:31,000
one. It has a particular jurisdiction. It's the Brussels capital region which emerged as a region

1359
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:38,920
somewhere in the 1990s, next to Flanger's Hamelonia, and it has so competences, it has a government

1360
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:45,720
argument. We can do stuff, the side stuff on the territory, but not on the culture because that's

1361
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:51,920
something that is being decided by Columbus and the Francophone community.

1362
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:58,220
But other than that, there's kind of sovereignty on that level as what can be decided.

1363
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:01,220
So it's a very strict kind of bounded space.

1364
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:06,020
If you walk 10 meters outside those boundaries in principle,

1365
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:09,120
the Brussels government can't say anything about you.

1366
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:14,920
And on the other hand, it also can erect all kinds of barriers,

1367
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:19,720
as long as one wants to add another lane to the ring road across Brussels,

1368
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:23,720
because it has very centered on car mobility.

1369
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:29,720
Well, there's a waste of blocking that, because there are certain stretches of the ring road,

1370
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:32,920
when Brussels can say, "No, let's not do that here."

1371
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,320
And then the end-to-end up still with the bottlenecks.

1372
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:49,320
Okay, so this is territorial power to some extent, which has also been used by the Brussels government saying everything is 50 kilometers an hour max when you entered our territory.

1373
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:57,320
So yeah, take it or leave it. So with territorial view, what Brussels could be?

1374
01:46:57,320 --> 01:47:02,120
One would be more scalar view and scale.

1375
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:04,560
Yeah, you could say it's a spatial scale.

1376
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,800
It's kind of a sensitivity to different processes

1377
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,240
work on different scales.

1378
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:12,080
Some of them are really micro teaching

1379
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:16,680
is a micro process taking place in the scale here

1380
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,760
of the classroom.

1381
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,360
Whereas you could say, commuting is something that's

1382
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:25,000
big place at the far larger scale.

1383
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:31,760
as we go home, it's a process that radically goes beyond the boundaries of this class.

1384
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,960
It's the same when you look at economic activities.

1385
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:40,160
If you look at the metropolitan area more logically,

1386
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:45,480
Brussels is actually much larger than the Brussels capital feature.

1387
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:52,440
So if you were to define Brussels as a scale of where urban activities take place,

1388
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:57,240
you could end up halfway to flongers or halfway to Bologna.

1389
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:02,760
So it radically deborders the territory that is the Brussels capital region.

1390
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:11,960
In contrast to other contexts, there has not been a very successful process of, you could say,

1391
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:20,040
city regionalization, where there was some kind of governance expansion to manage the

1392
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,960
the metropolitan process.

1393
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:25,480
And a lot of context to see that new governance structures

1394
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:29,200
have been erected, think about London, for instance,

1395
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:33,280
it hugely exceeds the original heartland of London,

1396
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,680
but includes more and more of its peripheries,

1397
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:41,240
because these places are connected to the urban area.

1398
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,000
This is not what happened in Brussels,

1399
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,880
and this has something to do with the fact

1400
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:50,680
that is a very commonitarian sense definition,

1401
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:53,140
because it deals with all kinds of issues

1402
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:57,080
of redistribution of income, et cetera.

1403
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:00,560
We have to keep in mind that about 60% of Belgian GDP

1404
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:05,320
is generated in Brussels, but it's not being governed

1405
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:08,960
into its totality by the Brussels government.

1406
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,480
In fact, and that brings us to the third one,

1407
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:13,880
it's a matter of perspective.

1408
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:16,040
There's all kinds of micro networks,

1409
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:19,080
and in this case, this is the commuting map of Belgium,

1410
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,000
that makes that the surplus that has been generated

1411
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,520
by all these activities and Brussels,

1412
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,280
I think about head order functions,

1413
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:28,600
you're being functioned that apparently

1414
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:31,320
accounts for a quarter of the Brussels economy,

1415
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:34,080
it actually leaks to the periphery.

1416
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,880
So it leaks beyond the borders of the territory

1417
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,000
of the Brussels capital region,

1418
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,800
a lot of people including myself,

1419
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:50,120
work in Brussels, but basically paid taxes outside of Brussels.

1420
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:56,440
So I didn't get this beautiful old city in Belgium.

1421
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:59,920
And I get taxed in flounders.

1422
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,560
I spent a lot of money well, not so much,

1423
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,760
because I worked too much.

1424
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:07,640
I could spend a lot of money in Ghent.

1425
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:10,600
But it basically is some kind of fiscal leakage

1426
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:13,680
from territory, right?

1427
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:17,320
And this is a problem of Brussels.

1428
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:22,320
We also could talk about Europe, rats, who are not texts at all,

1429
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:23,320
but work in Brussels.

1430
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:27,200
So we can wonder about the multiplier, economic multiplier

1431
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:30,200
that's being created by all these activities in Brussels.

1432
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:33,200
And that means that, yeah, there's a lot of large visiting

1433
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:38,840
class, about 400,000 commuters come to Brussels every day.

1434
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:42,520
Well, pre-corona, let's see if it's still the case.

1435
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:46,880
But the use of city dispense time on the infrastructure,

1436
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,440
but not necessarily paying for that.

1437
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:53,160
And I'll spare you details of other kinds of ways

1438
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:56,680
of raging deaths as solidarity then between the regions

1439
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:01,320
of Flounders, for instance, space a number of billions

1440
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,760
every year to Brussels as a sign of solidarity,

1441
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:07,560
where you can also frame it as just bamed bill

1442
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:11,560
for being on the metro and Brussels, using it every day.

1443
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:15,560
So there's kind of a discussion there.

1444
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:18,720
And it also is framed in very, at a terrible,

1445
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:22,360
humanitarian terms.

1446
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:27,280
And this is kind of when you use a concept like place,

1447
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,360
it gets you a bit closer to these processes,

1448
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:31,720
how people attach meanings to this place.

1449
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:35,000
So Brussels and how it's represented in Belgium media

1450
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:43,120
or Flemming's media, I invite you to buy a Flemming newspaper and run it to Google

1451
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:50,120
to see how Brussels is being represented, is particular frame, which has been augmented

1452
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:59,400
or essentialized even further as we had the terrorist attacks in 2016, where even Mr.

1453
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:04,400
former president Trump described normally as a health hole.

1454
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:10,080
I was very nicely taken over by a Chinese media because it kind of resonates with the idea of

1455
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:21,400
yeah, unsafe image of Brussels, dirty image of Brussels.

1456
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:24,240
And yeah, so it kind of resonates there.

1457
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:31,720
what you see is especially is that this also, say, reenacted in the entire COVID crisis, we're

1458
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:38,480
again, it's the same frame of yeah, Brussels got managed, look at vaccination rates, it doesn't get

1459
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:45,480
it for the relationship control, they're messing up again. If we were independent and flowers, yeah,

1460
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:51,960
that we could be of all kinds of other COVID regulations, etc. That would be free already. So it's kind

1461
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:58,840
of this frame of attaching certain meanings to certain places there's big. So if you just go to

1462
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:07,320
Lidakaka, or you could also take Delbeak, it's a big sign, who are flarming in Thursday. And so it's

1463
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:19,080
Lidakaka, it's somewhere here. So it's really in balance on Brussels in terms of commuting.

1464
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:26,600
But what you see is that with the kind of return of higher and residential functions to city

1465
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:32,600
to city of Brussels, that there's actually a lot of displacement going on and a lot of people

1466
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:38,440
that used to live in what they call the residual housing market still affordable housing in Brussels,

1467
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:45,320
it's actually being pushed out and it's increasingly computing to Brussels from further

1468
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:51,920
further away. So in a sense you can say Brussels is spilling over all the way to

1469
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:56,120
Lidicakka. What you see is that there is a very strong opposition by

1470
01:53:56,120 --> 01:54:02,760
either deterring parties, a local mayor, which is really trying to form a

1471
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:08,120
kind of bridge, if you will towards all that is foreign in this case Brussels.

1472
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:17,360
Okay, so, Lydicarica is placed in opposition to this process of urbanization there.

1473
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:22,920
We can think about it what we want when it's certainly something that is explaining a lot

1474
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:29,280
of the tensions between Brussels and its growing intellect.

1475
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:37,940
So for takes of Brussels to a four different kind of spatial approaches and I think

1476
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:46,560
combining them tells us a bit more about what on earth Brussels as a city is.

1477
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:50,520
Okay, is there still time?

1478
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:55,040
You still have time for one minute of thinking about what being critical means?

1479
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:58,040
I think eight minutes we can stop.

1480
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:02,560
So one minute of thinking of what is critical,

1481
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,800
not in a sense your condition is critical,

1482
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,760
but what is critical urban studies

1483
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,240
or critical urban geography for you.

1484

I want to build on that.

I want to make a stage as being aware of your own bias

1503
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:58,040
with like confirmation bias, cherry picking up

1504

something that's a huge help with being green goes well.

Can you explain that?

1507

Cherry picking is the fun of picking up your sources.

while you have IDA and your only code source that also of same owners that also represent IDA,

1533

having an approach that is politically engaged

1534

[ Inaudible ]

1540
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:07,320
I have to hold myself in the discussion.

1541
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:08,760
But it's an interesting point.

1542
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:11,960
I think it's about the critical about what effect is.

1543
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:16,560
Personally, I would say, it says how to have a fact as produced

1544
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,640
to use Bruno La Proul.

1545
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:23,280
In the sense that if you put men in white jackets,

1546
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,640
it would give certain people the more power

1547
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,040
to actually produce a fact.

1548
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:29,720
Whereas, for voices, marginal voices

1549
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:31,080
would not be in that position.

1550
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,120
Yeah?

1551
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:37,000
It seems like, I could feel level and involve, like,

1552
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,360
keep your life the implications of the way

1553
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:42,160
you're conceptualizing things are in terms of economic

1554
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:46,760
and social, in terms of that, and re-evaluating

1555
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,160
the theory of their framework.

1556
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:50,960
So you're using things not where you're hiding on that.

1557
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,200
Yeah, interesting.

1558

So again, being a reflexive about your own positionality,

1559
01:59:56,240 --> 02:00:00,120
going to piece out, to what extent your positionality

1560
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:07,120
shapes the questions you ask and I try to address that.

[ Inaudible ]

1562
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:35,120
>> Yeah. So knowledge production as a power-related process.

1563
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:40,120
where some boys are sound louder than others.

1564
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:46,120
It reduces the thing that also has geographical implications

1565
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:49,120
because it's not just some people, I mean,

1566
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:52,120
over in days when spatial structures think about local,

1567
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:55,120
local, local, local self, that's happening.

02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:56,120
Okay, thanks a lot.

1569

1570
02:00:57,120 --> 02:01:00,120
I mean, I have not so much to add to that.

1571
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:03,120
You can take the definition of Jonas at all

1572
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:06,520
And I think it catches some of the things that were being said.

1573
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:14,080
Think about new concepts that reveal something that we didn't know yet, kind of obvious, but still.

1574
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:19,520
Think about being politically engaged, yes.

1575
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:25,200
Something that matters one way or another, but be reflexive about the fact that

1576
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:31,360
some things might really matter and be picked up, but not necessarily be, you could say, very progressive.

1577
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:38,360
I mean, in a fascist society, there's all kinds of knowledge on segregation to be produced

1578
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:43,720
that is very useful, and you could be extremely politically engaged in that, but not necessarily

1579
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:48,840
thinking about, you could say, marginalized forces there.

1580
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:54,760
Third point indeed, taking seriously the experiences, life, practice, and words of ordinary

1581
02:01:54,760 --> 02:02:00,200
urban residents or marginalized social groups to think about, really, okay, we have this

1582
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:05,440
hegemonic representation, what would happen if you would ask different people with

1583
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:10,280
wisdom in a different positionality, etc., etc. Obviously you have your

1584
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:15,680
positionality as a researcher in yourself and maybe sometimes very hard

1585
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:22,280
for instance as a man to study from his perspectives. He may also be not

1586
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:29,240
recognized as being a rightful person to study in these kind of aspects. So I

1587
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:37,480
I think it's a kind of a negotiation process there and then again, or think about women

1588
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:45,400
that focus on the liteness of investment banking in the city, think about work within the

1589
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:51,960
McDowell for instance, and how it's a difficult process for women to actually enter these

1590
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:57,480
spaces, have access. But once they get access, they ask very different questions that

1591
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:02,480
actually leading quite revolutionary concerns.

1592
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:06,480
And now to another formulation, and that's why I was a little bit hesitant with

1593
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:14,680
there are no facts. I don't agree. I think there are facts, in a sense that there are factual

1594
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:23,380
realities. And you see this kind of kind of middle ground between you could say, shoot

1595
02:03:23,380 --> 02:03:28,980
as being something that's being constructed, but you always have to construct it on the basis

1596
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:37,860
of some kind of empirical factual reality. So not radical deconstruction or post-structuralist thinking.

1597
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:44,660
There's always a way of saying this is, I don't know the entire truth, but this is probably

1598
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:51,460
a little bit more true than something else. And yeah, you can write the citation, a re-decitation

1599
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:55,060
Sorry, what he says is that the ultimate goal

1600
02:03:55,060 --> 02:04:00,860
is to reduce illusion in society and of itself.

1601
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:05,180
So if you have sharp needs, they not go.

1602
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:07,540
And with the vocabulary in concepts,

1603
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,580
you can work with that.

1604
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:11,140
And you will see things perhaps in a different life

1605
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:17,420
and take away false beliefs and illusions in society.

1606
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:21,420
And it also means that it's a kind of a placeless

1607
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:25,480
and timeless definition is sense that this could be the mission, for instance, of critical

1608
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:31,040
urban studies or critical urban geography. And what is critical and what is a false belief

1609
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:35,760
and what is an illusion may change over time. But it's kind of, it keeps holding as a

1610
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:45,080
finishing, but it may have to be updated in terms of habits. So some rules of thumb, there's

1611
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:51,920
There's no universal theory of anything, and I think we'll show that.

1612
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:58,400
We have to be sensitive to the fact that every theory has its birthmarks.

1613
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:04,760
What were the questions that really gave rise to formulating a research question to a theory

1614
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,240
in a particular way?

1615
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:12,720
Well, we'll have to take a look at the context of historical and station to understand

1616
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:13,880
what that was.

1617
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:19,920
So think about the Chicago School that you'll be talking about with Nick.

1618
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,360
It was assumed to be universal model.

1619
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:29,840
There's actually a model of a city that captures rapid urbanization in the early 20th century

1620
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,520
and northern Europe.

1621
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,880
And then the question to what extent it actually explains something in different locations

1622
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,600
and different times.

1623
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:40,460
We're not going to reject that, but we have to mobilize that concept and see how far

1624
02:05:40,460 --> 02:05:41,460
we get.

1625
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:44,740
So we have to be reflexive about these bird marks.

1626
02:05:44,740 --> 02:05:50,180
So, even the concept of class is something that is a western inception, if you will.

1627
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:54,660
To an extent, does it allow to actually capture, for instance, Indian society?

1628
02:05:54,660 --> 02:06:01,540
So we need to kind of provincialize theory and say, okay, it originated at some point.

1629
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:05,780
And now we can meaningfully think about how we can speak of course context.

1630
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:11,940
So think about a global city as a concept that emerged,

1631
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:14,540
say mostly in Northern America, Western Europe,

1632
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:16,740
what extent does it allow to capture what is going on

1633
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:18,660
in Singapore for instance?

1634
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:23,540
So to play while being reflexive about these concepts

1635
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:25,900
with the application across the country.

1636
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:28,580
And engaged pluralism, that's kind of, I mean,

1637
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:30,100
might be for engaged pluralism.

1638
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:32,540
It means that there are different kind of theoretical stances,

1639
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:34,740
different kind of question being passed,

1640
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:37,100
entering from different kind of teams.

1641
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:42,020
And I think it's not just about acknowledging that,

1642
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:44,180
but it's actually engaging with this kind of

1643
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:48,100
dissenting opinions and trying to look for a conversation.

1644
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,980
And maybe we can talk a little bit more about that

1645
02:06:50,980 --> 02:06:53,580
next week or in the next sessions.

1646
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:58,300
As Purbin studies has drawn and become ever more global,

1647
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:01,140
as the urbanization has also globalized,

1648
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:09,940
There's always a risk that has some work that will become lost and in comparison to use the words of Jamie back.

1649
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:18,700
That we lose our points of reference to actually be able to have some kind of coherent urban studies project or at least speak to one another.

1650
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:24,380
So I think there's a danger with a global research agenda with so many contextual differences.

1651
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:27,540
How do we still make sense of urban processes

1652
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:31,100
when Singapore versus Brussels?

1653
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:33,300
How do you put them there?

1654
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:36,140
Now, I want to bore you now to that with the next two slides

1655
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:41,340
too much, but I just want to say that what geography was

1656
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:43,020
and what kind of critical questions

1657
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:48,300
were asked has changed tremendously throughout time.

1658
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:51,420
Much of geography originally was really

1659
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:56,300
about human interaction with the environment,

1660
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:59,880
say environmental determinism where it was really

1661
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:02,340
believed, yes, it's really the physical environment

1662
02:08:02,340 --> 02:08:05,380
that would shape human activities.

1663
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:07,820
Regional geography was also a very big tradition,

1664
02:08:07,820 --> 02:08:10,460
especially before the Second World War,

1665
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:12,540
where it was really about the description

1666
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:15,900
of human activities in their physical region.

1667
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:17,100
There's still some tradition there.

1668
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:20,220
But what really happened after the Second World War,

1669
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:22,420
Most were any, especially since the 70s,

1670
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:24,280
it was a period of, let's say,

1671
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:27,660
a social and political economic upheaval

1672
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:32,360
is a huge branching out of geography.

1673
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:36,100
So there's quite a plurality of traditions there.

1674
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:40,780
And they take us quite far from the origins of geography,

1675
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:44,060
which was really about settlements, if you will,

1676
02:08:44,060 --> 02:08:48,980
and the pre-World War era was about, okay,

1677
02:08:48,980 --> 02:08:51,940
show East India and where are the settlements

1678
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:55,540
or describe me the structure of a city.

1679
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:58,900
Of the second world war, especially in the United States,

1680
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:01,140
it was a kind of a nomotetic move.

1681
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:03,300
And we have to formalize this.

1682
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:05,380
And you have for instance, Walter Castella

1683
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:09,660
who came with quite a neat model to explain

1684
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:12,820
why at certain locations you had certain settlements

1685
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:14,620
over certain sides.

1686
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:17,900
Or for instance, the O's and what's going on,

1687
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:19,620
start formalizing the idea.

1688
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:22,780
OK, if there's certain activities within the city

1689
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:26,180
at a certain space, it must have something to do with the kind

1690
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:29,900
of value that is being generated by those activities.

1691
02:09:29,900 --> 02:09:32,060
And the fact that some activities out

1692
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:34,220
with others on a certain location.

1693
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:36,620
So these are kind of foundational approaches.

1694
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:37,860
And I'm going very fast here.

1695
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:41,860
I know, but it's just to take note of that,

1696
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:48,660
This led to much more plural discussion as of the '70s.

1697
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:52,060
And I can't really do justice to hold these different traditions

1698
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:52,860
here.

1699
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:56,500
But what you could say, more radical and critical voices

1700
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:58,700
share in one tradition, you could say,

1701
02:09:58,700 --> 02:10:04,020
yes, questions of social justice, distribution.

1702
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:08,340
They work in a materialist setting for what people have

1703
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:10,300
and how this class, for instance, income,

1704
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:16,380
It's a track pass, how does that explain the visions in the city?

1705
02:10:16,380 --> 02:10:20,060
Nice names, such as David Harvey, Neil Smith,

1706
02:10:20,060 --> 02:10:22,260
and I think the fair that those were kind of

1707
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:24,260
periods with a lot of social change,

1708
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:29,100
where social mobility of the working class in 1970s.

1709
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:33,980
Feminine's geographies that also emerged at this point,

1710
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:39,140
questioning male dominated views on society, et cetera.

1711
02:10:39,140 --> 02:10:42,260
So thinking about placing geography,

1712
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:46,340
relating it to the process of capitalism.

1713
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:50,420
The other big strands you could say,

1714
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:56,020
is more you could say a humanistic geography

1715
02:10:56,020 --> 02:11:00,180
that thinks about urban lifestyles, urban behaviors,

1716
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:04,940
urban cultures, which less kind of relates itself

1717
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:08,860
to capitalism in a sense.

1718
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:11,860
but really starts with, okay, what kind of forces

1719
02:11:11,860 --> 02:11:13,820
haven't we heard in the city?

1720
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:16,260
How are cities being experienced?

1721
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:18,980
Can we think about the power of representation?

1722
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:21,100
How different spaces are being represented?

1723
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:23,380
What the power of discourse is?

1724
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:25,460
It's not just about material circumstances,

1725
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:27,620
it's also how we think about certain places

1726
02:11:27,620 --> 02:11:30,460
that will explain what they've explained.

1727
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:32,220
And also, we shift towards more important things,

1728
02:11:32,220 --> 02:11:34,460
all of the different methods

1729
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:39,460
that kind of specifies the cultural term more widely.

1730
02:11:39,460 --> 02:11:41,660
And this is not the end of a conversation,

1731
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:43,740
I would say, and that's kind of your buttons

1732
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:46,740
of purpose of this more widely

1733
02:11:46,740 --> 02:11:48,500
and urban journey, particularly,

1734
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:51,700
that all these different approaches exist next to one another.

1735
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:54,340
But you have to kind of be aware

1736
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:56,460
that they work in different kinds of traditions

1737
02:11:56,460 --> 02:12:00,100
and then formulate questions in a particular way.

1738
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:03,060
And I think you will see returning here and there

1739
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:05,380
throughout the course, somebody who works,

1740
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:07,180
perhaps a little bit more in that framework,

1741
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:09,180
was thought to refer to that tradition,

1742
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:10,740
and it's something to be aware of.

1743
02:12:10,740 --> 02:12:12,780
I can't adjust this to the history of geography

1744
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:16,780
in three slides, that would be over the top,

1745
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:18,820
but it's something to think about.

1746
02:12:18,820 --> 02:12:21,020
Okay, I'll end there.

1747
02:12:21,020 --> 02:12:23,180
Sorry, it's for taking a little bit longer.

1748
02:12:23,180 --> 02:12:26,060
By next week, please try to get over

1749
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:29,700
over these two texts, or share it with your colleagues,

And the world city hypothesis by John Friedman and Paul B.

1751
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:38,740
And somewhat less old, but still already bit later.

All right.
