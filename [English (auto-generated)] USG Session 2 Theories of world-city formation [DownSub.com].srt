00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,000
[Music]

2
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,380
thank you

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,820
welcome everybody good evening

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,820
welcome to the second session

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,980
off Urban

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,500
social geography

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,340
uh thanks for being here uh despite the

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,800
live stream and the recording

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,920
I think it really makes sense to be here

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,700
um

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,559
so we can have a bit of an interactive

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,840
session

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,920
um

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,680
how did you arrive in Brussels first

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,760
week

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,000
everything going okay yeah

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,079
yeah okay you're Landing still a little

18
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:01,920
bit

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,019
yeah

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,020
um how did you find the stuff so long

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,760
for for those attending

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,560
did somebody attacks it's not so long

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,720
yeah

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,700
they don't live up to your expectations

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,500
more or less

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,560
yeah

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,540
did you find it weird that I started

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,320
with uh over 50 of the urban population

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,540
lives in cities that this was on the

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,680
first slide okay yeah we didn't have a

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,060
deal that she would put that on there

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,340
but

33
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,159
I can see your critical Minds

34
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,900
deconstructing that first slide so that

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,979
um

36
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,520
yeah we have our answers here ready okay

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,280
uh today we'll be talking about you

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,860
could say an important chunk of of

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,020
research into urban uh urban geography

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,119
um most about geographers yes

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,880
they haven't no last week that

42
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,979
yeah it didn't work

43
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,119
um

44
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,360
yeah you remember yes okay as well no

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,660
the system doesn't work I'm not sure why

46
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,239
um but I have a singing voice so I'll

47
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,900
try to project my ideas

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,300
um and if you don't hear it I can do it

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,120
if it's higher or louder

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
um but maybe we should be a little bit

51
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,099
quieter than that will help as well so

52
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,440
world cities Global cities one of the

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,239
big debates I think in urban geography

54
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,340
in urban studies more widely

55
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,220
uh it's also a very long-standing debate

56
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,459
uh going back to at least the 80s which

57
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,980
probably also explains why you had to

58
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,239
read old stuff uh that you may or may

59
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,480
not find outdated uh I hope it's not

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,760
outdated they're all texts but I think

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,319
they're still relevant in one way or

62
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,780
another and we'll also try to discuss

63
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,819
that a little bit now what's the

64
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,300
structure of today there's three main uh

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,959
Parts uh this lecture

66
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,420
first of all we're going to discuss

67
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,459
I I mean very generally the centrality

68
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,260
of cities and city regions in the global

69
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,360
economy and will take you through three

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,940
uh complementary views or views that

71
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,860
built on one another by John Friedman

72
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,739
Sasuke assassin and Alan Scott

73
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,780
secondly uh so that's kind of a

74
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,340
conceptual theoretical discussion

75
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,200
secondly we'll have more of a

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,659
methodological discussion which deals

77
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,319
with how uh given these Concepts how we

78
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,300
can actually measure and say something

79
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,299
empirical about world cities and Global

80
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,140
cities

81
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,599
and one of the main methodologies there

82
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,780
is the methodology by gork which is the

83
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,060
globalization of world cities research

84
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,879
Network which was founded somewhere in

85
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,159
the 1990s by Peter Taylor and has been

86
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,099
one of the main you could say empirical

87
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,140
methodological uh contributions to the

88
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,319
debate from that period

89
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,799
and then third of all as we'll learn

90
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,080
um there was some kind of a dominance

91
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,780
if you will in this area of cities and

92
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,399
globalization

93
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,820
um and there as a dominant voice there

94
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,000
is also quite a bit of uh friendly and

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,380
unfriendly critique criticism uh toward

96
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,259
um this particular framing of of global

97
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,900
City and world city formation and I

98
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,300
think going into these debates is

99
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,100
actually quite telling

100
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,520
um as to how we Define uh world and

101
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,040
Global cities uh where we think that

102
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,440
that criticism is Justified where it's

103
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,540
Perhaps Perhaps less just a fight where

104
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,220
it deals with other kind of issues and

105
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,440
I'll be talking about four of those

106
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,440
points of criticism one you could call

107
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,900
the both Colonial critique a social

108
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,540
constructivist critique people that talk

109
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,759
about State rescaling and the role of

110
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,040
the state and then finally

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,320
um some Brilliant Minds that had

112
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,660
something to say about financialization

113
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,540
okay and that may alter a reading of

114
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,880
what actually happens in world and

115
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,960
Global cities

116
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,780
but before we start

117
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,500
my question to you uh why are cities

118
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,800
Central in the global economy and what

119
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,020
would it mean to say that cities are

120
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,300
actually powerful economically powerful

121
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,340
take a minute uh talk to your neighbor

122
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,900
uh right time a few notes and think

123
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,820
about what your answer could be go ahead

124
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:52,020

128
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,699

[Music]

130
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,539
thank you guys

131
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,120
okay first ideas are the most creative

132
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,160
ones

133
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,960
uh yeah

134
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,300
so how are cities Central in the global

135
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,699
economy and why oh how can we see that

136
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,300
they're powerful

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,419
is he the burning hand

138
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,940
become those centers of

139
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,400
um markets and of multinational

140
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,160
companies and that's why it gets more

141
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
and more power sometimes even more than

142
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,440
the nation states that are updated

143
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,780
because they become the part of this

144
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,759
International network of those

145
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,160
pharmaceutical cities

146
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,699
and on the other hand it's like most of

147
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,000
the innovativeness most of the capital

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,120
um like mostly not Material these days

149
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,900
but also like social capital is placed

150
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,660
in those big cities and that's why like

151
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,260
you you kind of have this uh point of

152
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,080
migration of high professional stores

153
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,640
okay thank you so it's something that

154
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,880
these are the seats of corporate power

155
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,680
and perhaps the elite that buzz around

156
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,120
those corporations okay other ideas

157
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,670
yeah the back

159
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,519
[Music]

160
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,920
yeah

161
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
um

162
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,420
for example

163
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,959
yeah

164
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,820
okay so not just economic processes but

165
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,640
also the power of people and ideas

166
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,040
cultures diversity okay other ideas

167
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,140
yes I guess it helps out to that but we

168
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,060
we're talking about flows because this

169
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,800
is

170
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
true that all these flows come together

171
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,940
in large cities and then it becomes more

172
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,040
than it goes from this large city to

173
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,140
another large city and kind of

174
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,560
goes further than the national level

175
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,940
instead of going from the north city to

176
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,860
the the other parts of the country

177
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,399
because it moves between cities

178
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,620
and what is the the substance of these

179
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,660
flows it can be anything like for money

180
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,160
to knowledge to people

181
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,779
Commodities as well

182
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,600
okay other ideas yeah we were talking

183
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,560
about

184
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,220
um just like cities like city government

185
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,740
uh often have you know controlled daily

186
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,339
life budget and make cool side effects

187
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,380
you know a large number of people

188
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,720
quality

189
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,519
it's kind of the Benjamin Barber

190
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,980
argument what if Mayors ruled the world

191
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,680
there's a lot of in a lot of contexts

192
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,899
you could say the main economic centers

193
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,180
are also important political centers and

194
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,380
the national economy and National

195
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,720
politics and it seems to be also that

196
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,980
there's some kind of an extra

197
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,320
territorial supranational Authority

198
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,660
there as well okay thanks for your

199
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,060
answers I think there's other options to

200
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,380
talk about but

201
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,839
I think you already uh got to some of

202
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,700
the essential points what I'm going to

203
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,519
show you it's a bit of a a dated list of

204
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,860
figures but just to give a little bit of

205
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,399
of exhibits as to how important in

206
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,680
economic terms then and perhaps also

207
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,420
like the political terms

208
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,880
some world cities or world city regions

209
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,339
or Global city regions are this is a

210
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,600
list and this is research by a certain

211
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,540
man named lombrex from the early

212
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,660
Northeast and he compared the main you

213
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,940
could say leading metropolitan areas in

214
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,660
in Western Europe so it's by no means an

215
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,940
international comparison at a global

216
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,700
scale but it's comparing

217
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,760
um Delta Metropolis this is basically

218
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,339
Amsterdam rottenham the Hague Etc the

219
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,800
Flemish Diamond which is roughly

220
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,620
speaking against Antwerp Northern

221
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,620
uh Brussels uh which is kind of the

222
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,420
economic Heartland if you still remember

223
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,720
in Belgium

224
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
which is Western Germany kind of old

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,459
industrial area which is a a large

226
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,040
conversation with a lot of industrial uh

227
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,740
activity or at least it used to be

228
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,959
France this is basically greater Paris

229
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,300
and then greater London is greater

230
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,880
London okay so comparing these five

231
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,980
areas on a number of characteristics and

232
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,959
you'll also see the NX figures what he

233
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,140
kind of finds is that these region city

234
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,420
regions metropolitan areas are bunching

235
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,120
above their weight if you compare the

236
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,880
share in a national surface so the size

237
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,300
in terms of built-up structure depending

238
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,459
the complete territory

239
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,680
it's actually quite small

240
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,320
um when you compare that to figures in

241
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,079
population

242
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,940
these largely outweigh the share in

243
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,920
national territory and then when you

244
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,760
look at the share of these areas in GDP

245
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,279
which is kind of the value total value

246
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,579
of all economic transactions which is a

247
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,980
flawed measure in many ways but it's one

248
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,200
way of starting to compare National

249
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,399
economies we see that that these areas

250
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,139
actually punch above their weight so for

251
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,540
instance when you look at the Flemish

252
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,339
Diamond to take the Belgian example 30

253
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,399
of national service 52 of the population

254
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,880
lives there but 63 of all economic

255
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,060
activities uh actually take place there

256
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,720
um

257
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,880
more striking figures are even there for

258
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,700
uh for Paris and London only one and two

259
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,120
percent off uh of the territory uh about

260
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,360
we could say one-tenth to one one-fifth

261
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,000
of the population but in terms of

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,639
um of economic power especially for the

263
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,700
case of Paris it's it's way bigger than

264
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,339
you would anticipate okay so a large

265
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,740
um agglomeration and concentration of we

266
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,839
could say economic transactions that is

267
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,940
taking place

268
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,279
it also means that a lot of these places

269
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,740
tend to be richer

270
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,320
um than their Hinterlands okay so it's

271
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,959
kind of a runaway process it's something

272
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,519
with these activities that are taking

273
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,920
place there that generates more wealth

274
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,860
per capita so this is GDP per head so

275
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,200
you divide the value of economic

276
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,260
activities by the total population in uh

277
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,560
in that City so typically uh these

278
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,959
places are richer than

279
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,260
European average and also compared to

280
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,079
the rest of the economy in that sense

281
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,600
when you look at Brussels Brussels is

282
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,899
you could say the richest city uh in

283
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,420
Belgium

284
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,760
in principle richer than the rest of

285
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,100
Belgium but as as we discussed last week

286
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,480
there's a lot of this wealth actually

287
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,639
leaking to the periphery which is

288
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,880
actually in Flawless and bologna so it

289
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,800
doesn't really show when you look at at

290
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,600
figures from the Press of Capital Region

291
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,260
but the same would actually apply okay

292
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,480
um another way of looking at it is yeah

293
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,399
and this was kind of referred to by it's

294
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,620
a concentration also of ideas Innovation

295
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,540
people

296
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,459
um it's very difficult to measure that

297
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,279
one way of doing that is is looking at

298
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,459
patents right which is a kind of

299
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:10,620
certification legal certification that

300
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,079
something has been invented in one area

301
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,139
or another a coveted vaccine uh some

302
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,680
kind of a chip an algorithm whatever and

303
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,959
it has intellectual property on it so

304
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,760
and it can be commercialized in one way

305
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,139
or another but it's a very you could say

306
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,740
oh stock exposed kind of measurement of

307
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,519
of places and their their a measure of

308
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,620
innovation but it's a way to compare

309
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,540
different areas and what you see is that

310
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,779
uh here it's a bit more mixed

311
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:43,320
um if you for instance in in France you

312
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,560
see that uh that Paris is actually uh

313
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,899
outperforming the rest of of the country

314
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,260
this is far less the case in the UK but

315
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,360
it is the case in uh for instance the

316
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,820
Flemish dark okay so it's a bit more of

317
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,420
a but mixed picture but we see that in

318
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,639
general there's a tendency to locate you

319
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,740
could say Innovative processes as

320
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,260
evidence to battles okay there's a lot

321
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,660
of innovation that is not being measured

322
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,480
here no social Innovation for instance

323
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,360
it's really linked to Technologies uh

324
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,220
high-end services and these countries

325
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,360
okay

326
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,480
when you look at the the structure

327
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,839
of the labor markets uh you see that

328
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,440
typically metropolitan areas is also

329
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,459
show a higher share of Highly Educated

330
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:35,399
uh Highly Educated work okay so

331
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,980
substantially bigger

332
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,240
um say like

333
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,600
say in the Delta Metropolis it's 30

334
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,540
percent of uh Highly Educated people

335
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,300
compared to more or less 20 percent of

336
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,160
the rest of them in Netherlands and you

337
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,339
can have a look at the other cities to

338
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,620
see how it fares okay so a different

339
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,959
kind of Labor Market structure which

340
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,699
tells us something about the kinds of

341
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,139
activities that are probably taking

342
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,639
place there

343
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,900
uh and another indicator there is when

344
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,959
you look at the employment uh figures

345
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,679
across different kinds of sectors so

346
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,599
there's the in the three sector model

347
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,559
that's agriculture industry and services

348
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,720
and we see that well obviously uh

349
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,880
agriculture is very small but that's a

350
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,179
constant everywhere but that there's a

351
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,260
significant larger share in services in

352
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,020
these metropolitan areas than in the

353
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,900
rest of okay so it's there's these are

354
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,460
places that are not marked by industry

355
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,240
but by service economies

356
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,640
so these are just the number of exhibits

357
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,679
uh that tell you something about the

358
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,360
economic importance but it doesn't

359
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,480
really tell you why these places are

360
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,700
important it's just kind of a hint that

361
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,799
something is going on there and actually

362
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,340
you already mentioned quite a few ideas

363
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,280
of how we can theorize the centrality or

364
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,080
at least conceptualize the centrality

365
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,380
and Power in off cities in the global

366
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,640
economy one of the main text uh that is

367
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,039
in the reader for this week

368
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,919
was this world city hypothesis by by

369
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,140
John you've rolled Reddit

370
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,140
so you can just interrupt me if you want

371
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,299
to interject something

372
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,980
um but I just want to give you a number

373
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,400
of notes of my personal notes on on uh

374
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,679
what John Friedman was actually writing

375
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,820
about

376
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,360
so a bit of context to this uh to this

377
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,480
thesis or hypothesis it's a hypothesis

378
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,980
that

379
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,799
groups a number of observations from the

380
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,559
1980s tries to come up with a bit of a

381
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,220
research agenda that needs uh empirical

382
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,860
testing right but you need to understand

383
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,280
a bit more of this context of the 1980s

384
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,919
people of my age have to have the habit

385
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,380
of starting history in the 1980s because

386
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,480
it was the decade they were born if I

387
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,160
was 10 years older I was probably going

388
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,400
to refer the 1970s but as a toddler this

389
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
was my my context right so

390
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,320
um you have to remember that in the

391
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,320
1980s this was this emerging kind of

392
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,020
idea that we would experience the end of

393
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,600
the city right uh it was the rise of uh

394
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,919
information and communication technology

395
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,220
on a very Democratic large scale uh not

396
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,840
yet the internet but that was emerging

397
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,179
in the 1990s and being democratized

398
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,900
cheap mass transportation it became very

399
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,539
cheap to fly around the world

400
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,240
um shipping became something that was

401
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,760
very affordable

402
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,860
and what we kind of see is a complete

403
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,380
restructuring of the economy this kind

404
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,520
of reaching its high day in the 1980s it

405
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,340
was already going on in the 60s and 70s

406
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,160
but by the 1980s what became obvious is

407
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,280
that we we are in a new situation

408
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,320
which would call the new international

409
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,980
division of labor with new kinds of uh

410
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,559
geographies of production much more to

411
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,440
the the global east uh and far less

412
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,320
centered on the old industrial areas in

413
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,600
uh say European and America what we've

414
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,780
been discussing last week and we see uh

415
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,780
that this new centrality of cities need

416
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,360
theorizing if cities are not the places

417
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,840
where a lot of goods are produced and

418
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,940
hence where you get some kind of a trade

419
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,100
surplus when you start trading these

420
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,440
Commodities say textiles Etc with other

421
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,240
places in the world what is then the

422
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,400
kind of source of power that cities

423
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,080
actually hold okay

424
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,179
and what John Friedman comes up with is

425
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,100
say look to answer this question we have

426
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,780
to look at how cities are actually being

427
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,020
inserted and indeed an urban system that

428
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,660
is not only National but as Supra

429
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,100
National is actually a global Urban

430
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,059
system

431
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,919
you have to understand that in mostly in

432
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,200
the 1970s a lot of the tradition in

433
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,660
urban geography was looking at Urban

434
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,720
systems in a very nationalist way it was

435
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,000
methodological nationalism it was

436
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,799
looking at Argentina you have Buenos

437
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,080
Aires which was the Central City and

438
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,539
then you had a number of smaller towns

439
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,340
uh but there was a huge configuration

440
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,220
there uh and it left to some it left to

441
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,620
some blind spot as to what actually the

442
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,720
position of these cities were and

443
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,940
processes that went beyond National

444
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,880
economies and as these processes became

445
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,679
ever more prominent

446
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,740
it requested a huge uh you could say

447
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,679
conceptual Innovation uh that started to

448
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,919
emerge in the 1970s hence the importance

449
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,900
of Regents

450
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,179
um theorizing conceptualizing about

451
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,200
world city so a global Urban system

452
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,179
and the kind of main underlying

453
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,679
hypothesis sorry yes

454
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,860
so the last part what I was saying is

455
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,980
that you have processes of globalization

456
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,200
which means that the way that Urban

457
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,480
geographers were looking at Urban

458
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,780
systems became obsolete in one way or

459
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,600
another they were mostly linked to how

460
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,360
economies were functioning at the

461
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,620
national scale

462
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,200
uh looking into let's say where

463
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,059
productive activities were located how

464
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,220
commuter flows were organized how

465
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,559
Capital float etc etc

466
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,960
but as an increased share of the economy

467
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,559
became you could say International or

468
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,000
transnational

469
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,919
yes the first thing that needed to

470
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,480
happen was some kind of a conceptual

471
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,760
framework or apparatus that allowed to

472
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,320
understand centrality at a different

473
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,340
level

474
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,500
but differently instead of talking about

475
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,419
National Urban systems people started

476
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:47,580
talking about global Urban systems all

477
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,440
right

478
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,559
but looking at centralities okay so what

479
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,740
Freedom kind of uh started to to argue

480
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,780
also on the basis of his reading of

481
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,600
David Harvey in 1970s on Manuel castells

482
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,820
is that we can only understand what goes

483
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,980
on in cities if we relate that to the

484
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,620
position of these places in This Global

485
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,179
Urban system so it's the kind of their

486
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,400
function that they take in the global

487
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,380
economy or rather in This Global Urban

488
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,140
system that will help to explain what we

489
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,159
find in certain places

490
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
turned around on the other side of that

491
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,179
coin is that this Global Urban system or

492
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,580
this global economy can also be in part

493
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,280
explained through what is going on in

494
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,799
key Global cities or in this case world

495
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,440
cities to use the terminology so it's

496
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,240
the processes that emerge and are

497
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,700
steered and controlled from these places

498
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,179
that will have an impact on them larger

499
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,820
macro processes in the global economy

500
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,820
so that's kind of this dialectic global

501
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,299
system macro level Global Urban system

502
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:53,720
world cities and they're kind of

503
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,900
co-productive or co-constitutive right

504
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,360
so one of I mean one of the main

505
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,640
excerpts or key answer excerpts there

506
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
from this world city hypothesis which is

507
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,539
kind of very poignant is

508
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:07,919
um key cities throughout the world are

509
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,080
used by global Capital as basing points

510
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,580
in the spatial organization and

511
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,860
articulation of production and markets

512
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,480
the resulting linkages make it possible

513
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,880
to arrange a world world cities and into

514
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,460
a complex spatial hierarchy so it's

515
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,559
about appreciating how indeed capital

516
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,620
is and its actors

517
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,380
is kind of basing itself in cities as

518
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,960
they organize Global Production

519
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,620
and uh commercial activities okay so

520
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,720
that was kind of the main focus and if

521
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,179
we understand that we will start

522
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,520
explaining why certain places are

523
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,820
important and others less and why some

524
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,460
cities are dependent in this process and

525
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,419
why others are actually powerful

526
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,580
so yeah as I said it's a period of

527
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,520
geo-economic restructuring uh the loss

528
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,039
of a lot of functions uh that were

529
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,860
typically taking place in cities and I

530
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,960
mean John Friedman was was writing from

531
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,679
Los Angeles which was a very

532
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,620
production-centered uh town or city and

533
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,659
it was losing functions and what he

534
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,200
observed was still a huge concentration

535
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,900
of skyscrapers

536
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,779
and corporate headquarters but

537
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,760
production had long left

538
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,279
so this kind of conundrum was how do we

539
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,159
explain that how do we make sense

540
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,400
and indeed as I've been explaining you

541
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,840
had this emergence of the new

542
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,220
international division of labor

543
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,400
activities that were being offshored to

544
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,580
other parts of the globe and the

545
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,279
emergence of a new set of Enterprises

546
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,880
corporations multinational corporations

547
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,220
if you could say an American firm would

548
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,559
be globalizing or multinational

549
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:58,080
corporations where it was actually kind

550
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,240
of hard to still identify to what extent

551
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,380
they were still connected to some

552
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,820
territory yes

553
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,220
when you say that the production

554
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,860
activity has long left

555
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,440
what is the exactly these credential

556
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,539
activities I mean I this was the

557
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,700
question when I was reading the text

558
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,700
yeah I mean obviously it would depend on

559
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,279
the city that we're talking about uh but

560
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,799
think about uh what happened in cities

561
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,340
like Brussels I mean textile industry

562
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,400
um all kinds of of production facilities

563
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,580
for consumer goods that were initially

564
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,860
uh I mean think about washing machines

565
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,440
uh you know everything that you use in

566
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,000
the kitchen

567
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,700
um these were typically produced in the

568
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,580
post-war era in you could say the high

569
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,159
income industrialized countries

570
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,980
but because there was you could say

571
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,140
pressure on the profitability of these

572
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,120
activities because the wages were rather

573
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,620
High

574
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,919
these activities were offshore by

575
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,059
emotional multinational corporations and

576
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,820
one of the main motivations was the

577
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,000
search for for lower wages okay or you

578
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,320
could say less regulated labor markets

579
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,200
uh than than what was occurring in say

580
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,940
the traditional industrial areas yes

581
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:45,179
yes yeah I mean yeah indeed I mean and

582
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,580
this sometimes a little bit of confusion

583
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,059
there because people sometimes say okay

584
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:53,159
these industrial activities uh shifted

585
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,440
to the periphery so I think in the first

586
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,659
instance is the initial periphery of the

587
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,520
city I mean the whole year the suburbs

588
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,679
but I think even and it had something to

589
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,020
do with you could say more the urban

590
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,659
geographies the land Trends uh the

591
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,600
ground prices in cities because it's I

592
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,580
mean you need large surfaces and it's

593
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,640
easier to organize peripheries but then

594
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,400
at the later stage they would basically

595
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,380
uh I mean these activities were Cuts

596
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,960
because of investment in technology and

597
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,659
because you needed Less jobs

598
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:27,179
to make the same products and or there

599
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,059
were shifted to other places around the

600
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,580
globe okay so but this is kind of

601
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,980
I mean what what started to occur I mean

602
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,779
some people even in some Industries it

603
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,940
was already in the 1950s it's a kind of

604
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,140
this

605
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,419
and over a day

606
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,880
but it culminated if you will in the 70s

607
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,980
and then the early 80s which was a

608
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,020
period of crisis in a lot of cities

609
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,760
so yeah this new type of corporate actor

610
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,860
multinational corporations transnational

611
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,679
corporations uh and how they organize

612
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,320
Global production networks so a

613
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,000
production Network that used to be kind

614
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,580
of regionalized or nationalized in one

615
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,440
way or another

616
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,960
um relied on local suppliers ended up

617
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,779
being Global I mean if you have tried to

618
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,720
order a bike in the past one year you

619
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,120
know what it means to depend on Global

620
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Supply chains or production networks

621
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,220
it's just

622
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,380
an intensely fine-tuned process if

623
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,240
anything goes wrong

624
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,940
I don't know a tanker blocking

625
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,179
um the Suez Canal or something

626
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:34,500
uh it's a precarious situation but

627
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,899
that's the kind of reality Global Supply

628
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,360
chains and it's a part of the economy

629
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,919
that's extremely dominated by these

630
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:42,480
multinational corporations just some

631
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,299
figures I mean there's a timeline there

632
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:49,140
1960s was about 66 billion what was kind

633
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,600
of uh foreign direct investment

634
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,700
sorry for the technical terms the terms

635
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,140
here but it means

636
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,260
um direct investment in setting up

637
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,419
um factories so you build a plant

638
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,679
somewhere else

639
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,580
so like uh Mercedes-Benz built a plant

640
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,620
in Korea or something I'm not sure if

641
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,640
they did

642
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,000
our Toyota builds a plant in in Texas

643
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,620
and it's kind of foreign direct

644
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,440
investment logic and it boomed basically

645
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,260
and you look at the figures of 2016

646
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,760
um I could update that I should probably

647
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,220
do that about a third of the global

648
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,559
economy is actually

649
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:31,100
um equivalent to these FDI figures yes

650
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,740
foreign direct investment

651
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,779
it's not too important but you just have

652
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,840
to understand that this is a measure of

653
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,320
transnational flows so it's a measure of

654
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,340
uh what part of the economy is

655
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,440
um not local but it's actually Global or

656
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,640
transnational

657
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,820
and it relates to uh the investment

658
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,240
activities by large corporations

659
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,340
to set up

660
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,799
Greenfield Investments out of this goal

661
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,620
so imagine a green field where you put a

662
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,020
new Factory or some such thing as

663
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,880
Brownfield Redevelopment which is an x x

664
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,340
site which is then a refurbish or one

665
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,419
way or another

666
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,940
okay so these are those kind of

667
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,419
activities so 90 of this global economy

668
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:25,140
uh of this FDI is concentrated in these

669
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,659
multinational corporations and slowly

670
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,580
getting to my point here this is also

671
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,340
why John Friedman was looking at

672
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,679
multinational corporations and their

673
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:37,080
geographies to identify and

674
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,360
conceptualize uh world cities so for

675
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,480
John Friedman Friedman it were the

676
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,340
cities where a lot of these headquarters

677
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,279
buy is an international corporations uh

678
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,580
we're located we're uh I mean those were

679
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,860
those cities that he identified as World

680
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,960
Series Okay so

681
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,580
since they're so important in the

682
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,080
globally okay

683
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,600
so as he says world cities are then uh

684
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,919
to be uh sites for command and control

685
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,299
and he really saw these corporate

686
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,580
headquarters as the places that controls

687
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,520
and command it in various ways either

688
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,220
through governance systems by decision

689
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,460
making by their internal structure uh

690
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,020
how Global Production was being

691
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,100
organized okay and it's kind of

692
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,220
methodological hypothesis was if we map

693
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,340
uh these headquarter geographies

694
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,980
we will actually be able to to map the

695
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,200
global Urban system and we'll also

696
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,299
understand the relation between

697
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:39,659
different kind of cities uh as to who

698
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,960
controls what and so it's a way to to

699
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,520
look at Power in This Global Urban

700
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,120
Network some places are more dominant

701
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,799
hold more command and control functions

702
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,140
than others okay so and then he came up

703
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,580
with this um

704
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,860
with this map or art program or whatever

705
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,720
you want to call it

706
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,059
um yeah it's certainly dated because

707
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,580
Soviet Union is still on there and it's

708
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,299
not gonna not part of this figure which

709
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,720
is also debatable maybe they were not uh

710
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,360
I mean you could say euro-american

711
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,000
corporate headquarters there but for

712
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,039
sure there were links uh even with

713
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,980
between the Soviet Union and capitalist

714
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,919
countries for sure but the whole point

715
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,899
is that what what Friedman actually does

716
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,299
here is Translate

717
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,059
uh the critical tradition of world

718
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,000
systems theory which is a way to explain

719
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,640
uneven development in the global economy

720
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,700
to an urban framework so identifies

721
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,640
three kind of areas globalization Arenas

722
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,880
if you will one centered on Asia one on

723
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,380
Northern America and one on Western

724
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,500
Europe and typically he kind of finds a

725
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,240
Power Balance where you you have

726
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,340
powerful cities with a lot of corporate

727
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,980
headquarters uh and you could say the

728
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,620
northern part of the hemisphere and more

729
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,980
you could say subordinate roles for

730
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,260
countries in the global South so when

731
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,880
you for instance look at Northern

732
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,300
America you have Los Angeles Chicago and

733
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,280
New York which are identified as core

734
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,379
cities with a lot of headquarters and

735
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:14,659
they're kind of

736
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,520
organizational networks threats to the

737
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,800
global periphery so there's connections

738
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,839
with Rio de Janeiro for instance Buenos

739
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,080
Aires and these are kind of

740
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,239
semi-peripheral cities who

741
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,760
also hold command and control functions

742
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,280
and headquarters that are oriented

743
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,460
towards these centers in the global

744
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,440
North could be that there are

745
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,080
subsidiaries of large corporations that

746
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,899
are organized their setup Etc so it's a

747
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,940
way to explain how power is distributed

748
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,280
in This Global Urban system and also

749
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,379
starts to explain why

750
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,500
perhaps some places benefit more from

751
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,359
this integration in the global Urban

752
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,540
system than others so it would probably

753
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,240
lead to an accumulation of wealth in

754
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,400
cities in the global North

755
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,440
to some extent also in the

756
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,060
semi-periphery think about Uria de

757
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,980
Janeiro but at the same time it would

758
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,520
also work as some kind of a funnel of uh

759
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,640
to siphon off a siphon actually of

760
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,800
surplus towards the global North

761
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,820
for instance uh a U.S corporation

762
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,280
producing stuff in Argentina

763
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,560
um in part there will be benefits

764
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,780
locally but at the same time there will

765
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,720
also be an extraction of surplus value

766
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,060
to the global North okay so it's also a

767
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,119
way to understand

768
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,940
unevenness in this global economy

769
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,160
I know it's a lot sometimes a lot of

770
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,800
economic terms but just to give you an

771
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,500
idea a restructured global economy and

772
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,480
the imaginary of a global Urban system

773
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,900
and cities taking a different role uh in

774
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,540
that on the basis of their command and

775
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,900
control functions which treatment

776
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,960
defines as headquarter functions

777
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,440
so that's world cities world cities

778
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,880
corporate headquarters command and

779
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,640
control I'm just giving you a number of

780
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,740
key Concepts there

781
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,859
a second way of theorizing it is and

782
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,960
that's why I also had the other texts I

783
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,180
could have given you the entire book the

784
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,300
global City but it would have taken you

785
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,280
uh a week probably or at least a few

786
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,140
days to actually read it you're still

787
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,079
invited to do so but it's a kind of a a

788
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,480
shorter uh kind of version of the

789
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,180
argument which kind of explains what

790
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,720
centrality is uh to Sasuke assassin okay

791
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,520
um but I'll give you a bit more context

792
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,160
by by referring also to her book the

793
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,339
global City so one of you could say what

794
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,320
is being argued to be one of the seminal

795
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,540
pieces talking about cities and

796
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,780
globalization it starts kind of from the

797
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,720
same route as Friedman I mean it had

798
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,760
been a very intense conversation in the

799
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,579
1980s about yeah what is going on with

800
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,680
cities they have shifting functions

801
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,540
they're faced with the industrialization

802
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,599
etc etc there's also a fiscal crisis of

803
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,060
the local state a lot of cities were in

804
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,540
trouble if you you saw the movie Taxi

805
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,520
Driver with the young Robert De Niro

806
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,900
he's uh he's driving around the Relic

807
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,820
New York in the city neighborhoods are

808
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,579
in trouble there's a lot of blight

809
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:26,040
um so cities were struggling to think

810
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,859
about what their functions could be and

811
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,859
what is going on especially in 1970s is

812
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,079
a complete restructuring of these Urban

813
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,800
economies so for assassin it's less only

814
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,720
about you could say new command and

815
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,880
Control Function about headquarters she

816
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,619
looks at the complete restructuring of

817
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,599
urban economies from you could say

818
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,220
manufacturing jobs to service economies

819
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,339
so we already saw that the majority of

820
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,680
economic activities in metropolitan

821
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,540
areas of our services but she

822
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,940
particularly focuses on on a particular

823
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,020
subset

824
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,200
of these Services which of course

825
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,420
Advanced producer services

826
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,460
so in the coming months you will

827
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,500
probably start to hate the notion of

828
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,200
advanced producer services or be

829
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,560
intrigued by it but it's a kind of I

830
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
mean you probably never heard about it

831
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,820
and neither did I before I ever read

832
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,060
about it but it tells it's it's kind of

833
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,660
um

834
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,060
trying to capture those very

835
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,280
sophisticated if you will Professional

836
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,339
Services that serve as inputs for other

837
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:35,460
firms so in in themselves they don't

838
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,320
really produce much

839
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,540
but still their input is very important

840
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,400
for other corporations

841
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,520
think about financial services

842
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,520
law management consultancy accounting

843
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,000
and auditing advertising etc etc so

844
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,140
these are not really producing things

845
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,240
that you can then buy and consume at

846
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,339
some point

847
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:00,540
this is actually very knowledge

848
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,640
intensive sometimes it's also called

849
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,579
knowledge intensive Business Services

850
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:07,619
which are kind of consumed as they are

851
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,800
produced so legal advice it's kind of

852
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,980
produced in in face-to-face meetings

853
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,940
think about a corporation that wants to

854
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,760
set up a shop or a plant or an

855
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,760
investment in China a European firm

856
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,000
probably you want to check a thing or

857
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,859
two with a large international law firm

858
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:35,760
that can give you a lot of experience as

859
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,980
to what the regulations are for I don't

860
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,099
know investment and ownership in China

861
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:42,660
um you would need

862
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,740
dedicated Financial Services how do you

863
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,579
finance uh your International expansion

864
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:52,140
you would need

865
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,180
um the advice of auditing firms

866
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,579
accounting firms because probably you

867
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,560
want to attract some further funding by

868
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,380
issuing I don't know stocks or bonds or

869
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,420
something like that so Financial

870
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,760
investors would want to look at at your

871
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,100
activities

872
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,740
[Music]

873
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,599
um

874
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,980
advertising yes how are you going to

875
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,420
sell your cookies cars Etc in China

876
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,859
um you need to know something about

877
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:19,800
about the local market or local markets

878
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,839
the sensitivities

879
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,599
um so yeah you may want to adapt your

880
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,880
practices there you may need the advice

881
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,460
of management Consultants because you

882
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,200
may say that you want to globalize but

883
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,240
how are you going to manage this process

884
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,400
what kind of responsibilities do you

885
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,619
give to your managers in China do they

886
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,200
have autonomy to take decisions

887
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,380
uh will you work with uh with the

888
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,540
central command structure how will you

889
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,520
think about the profit profitability of

890
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,220
your activities etc etc I mean it's not

891
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,280
a course in um in business studies here

892
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,920
but just imagine as a firm that you want

893
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,200
to globalize there's a lot of things

894
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,859
that enter into the picture and probably

895
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:04,380
uh these kinds of inputs that you need

896
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,839
are so specialized as it doesn't make

897
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,060
sense uh to start producing them

898
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:13,320
yourself okay so uh you just buy a very

899
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,079
very specialized inputs you get in touch

900
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,720
with lawyers Consultants Etc they would

901
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,599
fly in charge the hell out of you and

902
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,800
then

903
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,940
um run off and maybe their advice was

904
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,820
okay so a shift to the service economy

905
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,099
but with the globalization of production

906
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,200
and the globalization of markets and

907
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,079
financial markets we see that certain uh

908
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,880
service firms are becoming increasingly

909
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,740
important and these are these Advanced

910
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,260
producer Services Services

911
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,960
given to producing firms

912
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,680
um

913
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,900
and what she says is look instead of

914
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,579
looking at

915
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:53,579
um headquarters of Corporations we best

916
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:55,460
look not at the multinational

917
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,140
multinationals themselves but we we best

918
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,960
look at where these APS firms are

919
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,040
located

920
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,260
and it's not just that they have kind of

921
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,440
cold control over global Productions

922
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,200
networks as you could imagine corporate

923
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,780
headquarters where a CEO with a big

924
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,400
cigar takes a decision of uh flashing 10

925
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,760
000 jobs in in Belgium or something it's

926
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,099
a more dilute uh diluted form of control

927
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:27,420
which he talks about it's more about the

928
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,079
control capabilities it's uh the

929
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,380
assemblage or the you could say in the

930
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,560
entire mixture of these kind of service

931
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,540
economies that allows firms that use

932
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,119
these services to exert control of the

933
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,160
global scale so multinational

934
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,560
corporations Patel look at the long

935
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,320
story story short depends on yet another

936
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,480
set of players Advanced with user

937
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,420
services to actually be able to manage

938
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,160
Global Production

939
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,280
so that's kind of her reading not just

940
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,440
corporate headquarters but look at these

941
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,280
notes of advanced uh producers

942
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,980
and the second important element that

943
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,660
she links to that and we'll talk more

944
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,819
about that next week because it's a

945
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:14,339
slightly different topic is that this

946
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:17,700
these APS economies is high-end service

947
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,660
economies also is an important engine in

948
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,880
producing polarization

949
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,220
the other kind of process that produce

950
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,060
polarized uh cities but an important

951
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,579
driver according to sussland is

952
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,720
the higher remunerated salaries stuff in

953
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,220
these kind of

954
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:38,839
um

955
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,460
activities and this will have an effect

956
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,180
on the city so it produces an outcome

957
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,160
where you have high and low skilled

958
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,900
labor forces in APS or around APS and at

959
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,060
some point it could also even lead to

960
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,520
what she calls the peripheralization of

961
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,980
the core okay so there will be a drive

962
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,700
also to to boost informal labor markets

963
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,260
uh in parts of the local aircon okay but

964
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,160
we'll talk more about that uh next okay

965
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,940
so that's her idea about global cities

966
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,119
and in the end Global cities aside from

967
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,440
the production of specialized Services

968
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,079
needed by complex organizations for

969
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,420
running a spatially diverse dispersed

970
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,220
network of factories offices and service

971
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,079
outlets and the production of financial

972
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,000
Innovations and the making of markets

973
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,920
both Central to the internationalization

974
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,260
expansion of the financial industry so

975
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,560
for assassin it's both about and you're

976
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,300
free to refer to socials because it

977
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,400
rhymes with buttons as other students

978
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,200
have done so before and make movies

979
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,880
about

980
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,980
um so it's both about global production

981
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,440
networks but also the running of global

982
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,260
financial markets so it's not just the

983
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,480
production of goods themselves but also

984
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,400
connecting to the world of Finance to

985
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,560
get investments in these production

986
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,839
models okay so that's what Sasuke

987
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:02,579
assassin is talking about

988
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:06,780
and the the Paradox that she sees is

989
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,700
um is that as there's a kind of a

990
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,280
dispersion of activities at the same

991
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,140
time there's a growing need for

992
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,720
concentration okay the more dispersed

993
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,160
Global production networks the common

994
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,619
financial markets the more the need for

995
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:21,900
centralized control or control

996
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,000
capabilities over these markets so

997
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,900
that's kind of the Paradox of cities

998
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,960
despite uh the internet Etc or

999
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,720
virtualization of activities there's a

1000
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,520
continued role

1001
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,859
um for for face-to-face interaction

1002
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,400
interpretation and limited set of cities

1003
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,880
so why are APS located in a limited

1004
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,140
number of cities

1005
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,660
well she talks about different kinds of

1006
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,119
part dependencies so it means that once

1007
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,940
a situation establishes itself it's kind

1008
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,920
of there's all kinds of cells

1009
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,380
reinforcing mechanisms

1010
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,060
so

1011
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,940
if there's a concentration there's a

1012
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,339
deep Market in services so if you go to

1013
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:06,839
London for instance you're quite sure

1014
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:09,540
that you will find everything

1015
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,359
um if you have these kind of services uh

1016
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,579
some kind of a labor market culture

1017
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:17,040
where will emerge around that you'll

1018
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,339
find a specialized labor there and yeah

1019
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:22,440
in a lot of world and Global cities

1020
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,560
think about New York uh or London some

1021
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,180
kind of a yep culture young urban

1022
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,780
professional culture has emerged within

1023
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,480
these kinds of APs firms

1024
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,579
um there's also a lot of synergies

1025
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:37,380
between these firms and I'll tell you a

1026
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,020
little bit more about that so also these

1027
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,200
different ads firms work together as

1028
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,960
they Service uh their clients

1029
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,380
and what is even more striking is that

1030
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,480
these APS firms in and of themselves

1031
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,260
also become Global corporations so they

1032
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,020
also set up International

1033
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:00,180
networks either to follow their clients

1034
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,780
or to be to remain credible as a global

1035
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,260
as a global act okay so a number of

1036
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,020
reasons why this kind of geography

1037
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,880
reproduces itself and is increasingly

1038
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,099
anchored in in a number in a limited

1039
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:17,099
number of global cities

1040
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:20,220
some empirics uh from a dear a colleague

1041
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,700
from it will be much even clicking in uh

1042
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,240
who did a kind of nice set of maps on

1043
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,700
law firms in Brussels it's kind of

1044
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,599
interesting to see that the

1045
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:33,599
concentration in global cities you could

1046
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,700
say when at the more abstract level also

1047
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,040
translate into clusters at the

1048
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,140
Metropolitan level and it tells us

1049
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,819
something about you could say the more

1050
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:44,700
micro sociologies and geographies of

1051
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,319
these kind of Professional Services so

1052
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,240
what you see is on the left hand side

1053
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,339
law firms

1054
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:53,280
um the big picture are foreign law firms

1055
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,780
the smaller insect map is is Belgian

1056
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,099
firms the number of commonalities

1057
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:04,380
which is kind of the center of a very

1058
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,720
rich neighborhoods or set of

1059
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,180
neighborhoods in South Brussels is a

1060
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,420
location of both uh I think Belgian

1061
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,720
um Boutique law firms and also larger

1062
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,359
Law Firm but one is foreign law firms

1063
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:21,420
but what is special for the foreign law

1064
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,280
firms they're very much concentrated

1065
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,280
around the EU District okay so a lot of

1066
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,440
activities either have something to do

1067
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,400
with

1068
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,280
uh deploy their clients that are located

1069
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,140
there which is either directly the

1070
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,500
European commission or

1071
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,880
um or firms that's want to Lobby uh the

1072
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,160
European commission and this is kind of

1073
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,200
a process that we'll talk a bit more uh

1074
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,240
when we do the

1075
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,819
um the tour in Brussels in uh the end of

1076
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:53,400
next week okay so micro geographies are

1077
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,980
also uh produced microclusters produced

1078
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,900
at the urban level the same as for

1079
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,780
instance through in um in London has

1080
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,339
some great work by

1081
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,160
um cook at all not Captain Cook but

1082
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,880
another cook so we cooked up this figure

1083
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,260
um obviously what you see there is the

1084
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,300
city of London which is also a very

1085
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,940
particular uh jurisdiction in and of

1086
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,099
itself it's it has some kind of an

1087
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,920
exceptional rule that doesn't follow the

1088
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,079
regulations of you could say the

1089
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,420
continent in this case the UK in and of

1090
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,339
itself the government in a very weird

1091
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,800
way I never I can never recall how

1092
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,359
exactly and I'm not even sure that

1093
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:33,000
information is themselves but it's kind

1094
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,300
of a self Corp I mean the self-regulated

1095
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,400
self governed

1096
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
um jurisdiction

1097
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,400
on on the island

1098
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,819
where corporations also have a large uh

1099
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,819
say in okay so within the LA the limits

1100
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:52,920
of the city of London uh you find

1101
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,660
particular regulations there that's why

1102
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,940
the stock exchange is located there and

1103
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,560
all the financial institutions are

1104
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,319
located around and then besides that the

1105
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:03,359
specialized District the legal District

1106
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,420
etc etc so this tendency of of seeking

1107
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,520
proximity is also evidence yeah

1108
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:19,380
firms also uh interact with one another

1109
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,700
um so this is some work we did in

1110
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,020
Brussels uh we took a corporate survey

1111
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,960
uh aimed at uh APS professionals so we

1112
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,540
we sent the survey around to it with a

1113
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,180
league less expert ICT experts etc etc

1114
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,000
bankers and they kind of listed how they

1115
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,220
interacted with other APS firms either

1116
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,839
in their daily practice for themselves

1117
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:43,800
or as they uh were giving services to

1118
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,839
their customers okay and what you find

1119
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,780
is actually quite a bit of interaction

1120
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,880
um with sector itself

1121
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,119
uh and also particularly between sectors

1122
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,599
and law and finance law accountancy and

1123
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,880
law and against and financial services

1124
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,960
so just imagine uh as a corporation what

1125
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,559
often happens is that yeah when you

1126
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:10,260
issue some kind of financial product

1127
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,880
think about

1128
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,220
um a share or something or you want to

1129
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,720
go for a loan

1130
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,760
then we need a financial institution we

1131
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,579
need a law firm that needs to kind of uh

1132
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,980
come up with a prospectus or check the

1133
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,440
perspectives that is that is made by um

1134
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,160
by financial institutions uh Auditors

1135
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,960
and an accountant would have a look at

1136
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,960
that so this is a kind of connected uh

1137
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,839
thing to financial markets what we also

1138
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,520
found is quite some interaction between

1139
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,220
ICT and financial services this has

1140
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,599
something to do with you could say the

1141
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,579
digitization of finance that is

1142
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:46,859
currently going on

1143
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:49,440
um so quite a bit of interdependencies

1144
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,300
between different sectors will also

1145
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,119
explains why does the need for proximity

1146
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,380
yes there's a question

1147
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:01,859
that's a very good question

1148
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:04,260
um what do I remember from these

1149
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,260
percentages I think

1150
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,900
um all right so I think the um yeah

1151
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,300
that's it's standardized to the you

1152
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,099
could say the largest link so we looked

1153
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,540
at you could say the intensity of

1154
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,640
interactions and we found that within

1155
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,800
financial services this has the

1156
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,839
strongest link so

1157
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,880
it's it's a it's a relative scale so

1158
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,119
that's the strongest link it's uh 100

1159
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:28,500
and then you when you for instance look

1160
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,900
at the relation between law and

1161
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,960
financial services the strength of the

1162
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,300
tie between law and finance is only half

1163
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,460
of the kind of relations within Finance

1164
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,880
itself

1165
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,420
um it was measured in a different way

1166
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:50,220
it's measured uh by frequency so uh on a

1167
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:54,839
regular basis how much do you uh hire

1168
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:59,940
advice uh in you could say law etc etc

1169
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,020
um

1170
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,059
but there's other ways of of measuring

1171
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,880
that for sure okay so it's it's one way

1172
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,480
of doing that so yes this kind of

1173
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,880
um gravitational pull towards other

1174
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,520
actors in This APS complex explains kind

1175
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,440
of the reproduction of global cities

1176
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,800
another one was indeed this

1177
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,040
globalization of strategies of uh APS

1178
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,839
firms themselves so they're both

1179
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,940
clustered and they're globalized at the

1180
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,059
same time uh Deloitte

1181
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,760
um well I mean it's part of its uh of

1182
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,819
its branding process HSBC it's the same

1183
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:37,859
thing so it's playing on both being

1184
00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:40,200
Global and tapping into local knowledge

1185
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,200
okay you may think about that what we

1186
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,359
want but it's certainly a part of their

1187
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,520
corporate strategy or the geographical

1188
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,079
strategy

1189
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:50,339
Etc

1190
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:54,720
okay yes okay that's probably early days

1191
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,339
but are you guys looking at all about

1192
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:57,900
how

1193
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,400
coveted forward

1194
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:06,960
uh no I was taking care of my children

1195
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,359
um no uh but I think that's a good point

1196
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,059
I mean

1197
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:13,740
uh I think for sure there has been a

1198
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,280
tremendous impact on business travel

1199
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,800
but it's also kind of a long discussion

1200
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,839
as to what extent you need business

1201
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,240
travel these are the video conferencing

1202
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,819
and other kinds of things

1203
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:27,540
um

1204
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,460
so there's already quite a bit of

1205
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,800
research in there there's also you could

1206
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,559
say more ethnographic approaches uh that

1207
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,420
are kind of questioning

1208
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,359
uh the actual data relevance of having a

1209
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,119
global network but differently are these

1210
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,220
offices really being used or are they

1211
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,319
mainly there to have an address and

1212
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,319
populate websites uh and then you may

1213
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,000
actually find that it's much more

1214
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,520
concentrated within a number of global

1215
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,859
cities despite having a very Global

1216
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,559
Network and there could be other ways of

1217
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,839
organizing yourself either having

1218
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,819
temporary clusters or meetings or

1219
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:05,460
conferences to make things work that

1220
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,800
there's also and we'll read a bit about

1221
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,260
that a practice of circumference of

1222
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,200
people that are that are based in London

1223
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,880
that are then two years based in

1224
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,440
Singapore so there are other kind of

1225
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,180
strategies

1226
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,000
um but yeah the main kind of question

1227
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,980
will indeed be

1228
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,180
um

1229
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,720
covet now the final proof that there's

1230
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,760
an end to the city

1231
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,059
I think that's hugely overblown and I

1232
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:34,559
think that's quite a quite a bit of

1233
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,260
reasons about the knowledge and density

1234
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,960
of certain practices that explains why

1235
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,079
face-to-face and direction will prevail

1236
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,920
just as uh when you think about teaching

1237
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,960
there's hopefully some added value to

1238
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,480
face-to-face teaching over looking at a

1239
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,579
screen

1240
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:54,839
and it has something to do with the

1241
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:56,880
interpretation of information and is

1242
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,220
being shared about how grounding

1243
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,559
processes work do we think the same

1244
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,160
about certain Concepts Etc and if you

1245
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,800
don't do this face to face you just miss

1246
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,200
out on this micro uh feedback loops if

1247
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,240
this would be online I wouldn't see

1248
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,180
nodding or frowning so I would be in

1249
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,460
trouble sometimes okay so I think yeah

1250
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,640
it's clearly it's a very important

1251
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,839
question

1252
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,300
there will probably be a more strategic

1253
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,240
use of these sites and will also be a

1254
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,220
more selective use of face-to-face

1255
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,540
interaction which were done ultimately

1256
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,880
also input

1257
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,599
um

1258
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,760
input APS activities and their

1259
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,099
geographies but it won't lead to a

1260
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:44,400
dissolution I think personally uh I see

1261
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,319
no no theoretical reasons why that

1262
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,380
should be obsolete

1263
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,079
but it's uh it's it's research that

1264
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,240
could be done and I mean there's a whole

1265
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,700
class of uh of people digital Nomads uh

1266
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,280
these are more you could say

1267
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,660
self-employed they don't depend on other

1268
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,480
inputs uh in their production process

1269
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,700
think about setting up a website or

1270
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,680
something you can just go to Bali and do

1271
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,200
that from there but even there you see

1272
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,300
uh the emergence of temporary clusters

1273
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,800
other digital Nomads that are in Bali to

1274
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,660
discuss stuff

1275
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:25,140
etc etc so I think even there there's a

1276
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,619
social aspect to that and you get the

1277
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:31,800
return of centrality even where you

1278
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,780
don't expect it and it seems to be

1279
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,420
something that is related to the fact

1280
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,800
that we're talking about cognitive

1281
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,920
culture capitalism and that's a

1282
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,099
excellent bridge to what Aaron Scott is

1283
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:45,240
talking about

1284
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,480
in his notion of global city regions so

1285
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,460
we talked about world cities corporate

1286
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,220
headquarters sussing talks about global

1287
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,619
cities you look into a wider complex of

1288
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:57,660
these Advanced Services that sit around

1289
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,520
corporations

1290
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,319
and then uh Alan Scott who says well

1291
00:58:03,319 --> 00:58:06,300
you and your world in global cities how

1292
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,059
do you explain something like this which

1293
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,359
is a much larger conversation which is

1294
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:15,540
urban to some extent which depends here

1295
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,180
on San Francisco

1296
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,880
in case you haven't noticed but how do

1297
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,800
you make sense of this wider San

1298
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,559
Francisco Bay area with a lot of we

1299
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:27,599
could say centrality but it's not

1300
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,520
necessarily connected to poor

1301
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,119
metropolitan areas so what kind of Alan

1302
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,579
Scott is talking about and says yes uh

1303
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,559
very nice that we talk about this

1304
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,059
classic

1305
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:41,460
um world and Global cities when you when

1306
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,500
you look for instance she was talking

1307
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,079
about New York London Tokyo later on

1308
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,400
Chicago

1309
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,099
uh neat metropolitan areas but there's

1310
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,440
other kind of structures uh

1311
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,420
morphological structures polocentric

1312
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,799
regions that do not necessarily fit the

1313
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:02,240
definition uh that that

1314
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,740
Sasuke assassin or John Friedman is

1315
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,599
talking about and that also links a

1316
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:07,920
little bit to what we discussed last

1317
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,480
week

1318
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,480
um how the city looks like or where the

1319
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,000
urban is can actually spill over

1320
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,579
metropolitan areas okay

1321
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:20,760
so clearly places like uh like Silicon

1322
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,900
Valley

1323
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,299
um they're not dependent on the poor

1324
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:28,200
urban area per se but they also kind of

1325
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,420
um an example of the need for proximity

1326
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:35,599
and high-end Advanced sectors right so

1327
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,420
what Al Scott says is that yes

1328
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,359
something is right

1329
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,540
but the kind of wider uh process that is

1330
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,000
going on is a process towards centrality

1331
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,839
in knowledge intensive

1332
00:59:50,839 --> 00:59:54,660
activities and this pertains to ABS

1333
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,400
firms that are located and you could say

1334
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,980
the poor metropolitan areas but it also

1335
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:02,700
applies to high-tech firms the gaffa's

1336
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,339
platform corporations etc etc all these

1337
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,559
kind of innovations that came out of

1338
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:09,540
Silicon Valley for instance or when you

1339
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,339
look at the Pearl River delta which is a

1340
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:14,040
kind of much more Polo Centric uh

1341
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,579
production area in in the southeast of

1342
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:19,619
of China

1343
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,680
um it's also a form of centrality uh

1344
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,720
where you have some metropolitan areas

1345
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,640
or Metropolitan courts but it also goes

1346
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,160
beyond there so what what interests Alan

1347
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,339
Scott is more yeah this driver of

1348
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:35,460
centrality Beyond APS themselves and it

1349
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,859
says look at the centrality uh that

1350
01:00:37,859 --> 01:00:40,500
Sasuke assassin finds is actually part

1351
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,619
and parser of a wider uh shift towards

1352
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:45,900
cognitive cultural capitalism right so

1353
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,000
CCC

1354
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,520
and it means that a lot of economic

1355
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,940
activities crucially depends on on

1356
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:57,240
knowledge inputs and types of knowledge

1357
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,420
that are not generic not standardized

1358
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,319
that are not easily appreciable at a

1359
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,960
distance no you need interpretation

1360
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,540
dialogue with clients dialogue with

1361
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,119
other colleagues to make sense of what

1362
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:14,579
is going on because it's a very complex

1363
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:15,420
matter

1364
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,579
you need to make sense of the situation

1365
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:20,220
collectively and hence there's a drive

1366
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:23,940
for proximity there okay and this

1367
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:28,440
applies to an increased uh part of of

1368
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,260
the economy which also means that it it

1369
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,540
goes Way Beyond the first producer

1370
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,619
surface so and the spatial form it takes

1371
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:39,780
is is one of global city regions so you

1372
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,940
have a more polymorphic quality

1373
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,339
polycentric kind of structure

1374
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:47,040
and his kind of meta geography if you

1375
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,680
will is a world of global city regions

1376
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,619
with this kind of interconnection

1377
01:01:51,619 --> 01:01:54,660
interconnected and Blazer role in these

1378
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,180
uh Global production networks in global

1379
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,319
markets yes

1380
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,380
yes

1381
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,420
and this we need this kind of connected

1382
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,880
to this APS that are all this service is

1383
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,859
connected to

1384
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:19,799
um well the point by Scott is that uh

1385
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:23,280
yes in APS and law firms Finance Etc

1386
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,440
there's a clear need for proximity for

1387
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,119
the reason that we've been discussing

1388
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,760
but this also applies to other parts of

1389
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,660
the economy think about high-tech

1390
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:37,220
um think about education or whatever

1391
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,540
and these are also prone to this

1392
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,760
agglomeration Dynamics and that is

1393
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,140
because

1394
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:46,020
um increasingly the production process

1395
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:49,859
is knowledge intensive just compared to

1396
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:51,599
um you could say 50 years ago it would

1397
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,160
have been a very standardized process

1398
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,059
just make 1 000 cars per week

1399
01:02:57,059 --> 01:02:59,760
this is becoming increasingly customized

1400
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,400
uh it's much more about prototyping it's

1401
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,920
much more about

1402
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,960
tailoring uh particular cars I mean I

1403
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,280
don't know anything about cars but I'm

1404
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,880
I'm stuck with cars

1405
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,819
so it's it's much much more uh just in

1406
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:17,460
time delivery it's much more tailored

1407
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,220
rather than than mass production that

1408
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,640
used to be the case uh in the 50s 60s

1409
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,520
70s and this has shifted

1410
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,040
roughly in the 1980s where it was more

1411
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,559
about flexible production systems where

1412
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:33,420
you could say the connection with

1413
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,760
suppliers but also customers clients

1414
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,040
became much more important so it's a

1415
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,720
kind of broad scale

1416
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,579
restructuring of the economy which also

1417
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:44,400
explains why proximity matters not only

1418
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,859
in these Advanced administers but more

1419
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:49,740
broadly to bitcoin I don't understand

1420
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,740
what drives

1421
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,319
these companies together in Silicon

1422
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:56,880
Valley for example

1423
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,520
okay well I have a whole lecture on that

1424
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,040
and economic and financial geography but

1425
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,799
I mean in part part of the story as you

1426
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,780
could say the Contemporary benefits of

1427
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,760
economic agglomeration which has

1428
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,680
something to do with yeah what economic

1429
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,720
geographers call positive externalities

1430
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,000
by being there you get certain benefits

1431
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,980
that you wouldn't get if you're not

1432
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:17,880
there

1433
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,359
stepping into high-scaled labor uh High

1434
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,579
skilled labor for instance Venture

1435
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:26,460
Capital etc etc but there's a lot of uh

1436
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,260
what people call Cloud dependencies as

1437
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,760
well and when you look at the story of

1438
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,460
Silicon Valley there used to be a lot of

1439
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,220
government investment there

1440
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,680
um I think U.S military and the

1441
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,780
semiconductor business making chips and

1442
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,420
those kind of things was hugely funded

1443
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,940
by the federal government

1444
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,640
in NASA DARPA and all kind of Ministry

1445
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,780
of Defense

1446
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,299
and a lot of these Innovations within

1447
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:54,059
later on commercialized by private

1448
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:55,440
players

1449
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,960
who then use these Technologies to build

1450
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,119
their own platforms and there's great

1451
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:02,160
work by Mariana matsukata for instance

1452
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,940
who uh who's a great Economist who says

1453
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,660
well if you look at your iPad

1454
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,359
almost every critical

1455
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:14,460
uh element there piece of technology can

1456
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,380
be related back to some kind of federal

1457
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:20,280
investment uh etc etc so

1458
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,680
which brings certain to an argument

1459
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,079
about is it really private Innovation

1460
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:27,299
that we're talking about or does it have

1461
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:28,799
something to do with sustained

1462
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,799
investment by public authorities in

1463
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:33,780
these kind of Investments the same is is

1464
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,880
true for big Pharma for instance it's

1465
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,400
universities that come up with new

1466
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,660
vaccines and these are then

1467
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,720
commercialized by Pfizer Etc

1468
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,599
um so it's very complex story and no

1469
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,599
clear answers it's a field of its own uh

1470
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:50,520
but what we need to do we need to

1471
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,400
understand is that this proximity and

1472
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,099
the centrality goes beyond cities

1473
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:57,420
themselves

1474
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,359
okay so it's it's much more prevailing

1475
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:02,040
process

1476
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,680
but still I mean the point being is that

1477
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,640
at some point APS firms uh even in these

1478
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,319
Global city regions they would still

1479
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,819
have some kind of a role to play as

1480
01:06:11,819 --> 01:06:14,099
connectors think about Silicon Valley

1481
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:15,660
firms

1482
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:18,540
um that come up with new technologies or

1483
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:21,660
that want to make make a profit out of

1484
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,640
these new Innovations

1485
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,680
they would have to be kind of certified

1486
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,900
patented their intellectual property

1487
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,940
would be protected as probably very

1488
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,859
likely that would be uh San

1489
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:34,140
francisco-based law firms that would

1490
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:40,520
then specialize in okay uh yep

1491
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:54,720
well I mean they're not you now this

1492
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,400
kind of these are the debates I'm just

1493
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,160
rehearsing the debate of the 1980s 90s

1494
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,559
slowly getting to the Northeast and

1495
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,180
we'll we'll move through that uh

1496
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,799
throughout the lecture

1497
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:05,760
um

1498
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,579
uh but this mainly tries to capture what

1499
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:12,059
went on uh in the 1980s and what what

1500
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:14,520
was the starting point if you will of a

1501
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,200
theorizing of world and Global cities

1502
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,619
right now

1503
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,079
there was a belt yeah

1504
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:36,420
well uh well there there so the question

1505
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,579
is as to what extent is the Rust Belt a

1506
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:41,940
global City I don't think I mean it it

1507
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,700
would uh Alan Scott would really see

1508
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,619
that as a as a global City region

1509
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:48,960
because it's it's mostly you could say

1510
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,539
uh a remnant of an older process of

1511
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:53,640
industrialization which was much more

1512
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,619
focused on mass production so think

1513
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:59,400
about uh factories in Pittsburgh Detroit

1514
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,260
etc etc

1515
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,599
the fort Factory

1516
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,400
um and this was kind of in the history

1517
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,039
of the of the US it was a kind of

1518
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:10,260
process of industrialization that was

1519
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,260
finalized but on its returns since since

1520
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,599
the 60s 70s and then you had to switch

1521
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,679
to the Sunbelt States uh a lot of

1522
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,060
production especially in the car

1523
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,179
industry was taken over by Japanese

1524
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:25,799
Investments and a lot of states where

1525
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:30,719
the labor rights were less protected so

1526
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:35,520
mm-hmm

1527
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,219
I mean the difference would be uh to

1528
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:39,779
what it's and I mean it's just one

1529
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:41,219
example but the question would be to

1530
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:44,759
what extent do uh in this day and age uh

1531
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:47,100
knowledge synthetic intensive production

1532
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,779
activities or other activities takes

1533
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:50,640
place in the Rust Belt I think to some

1534
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,859
extent this is the case but it wouldn't

1535
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:56,219
be an uh a leading example I don't want

1536
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:58,500
to be exclusive I think it could be

1537
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,359
visualized as such but it would be more

1538
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,339
of an empirical question to what extent

1539
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,439
is actually taking place

1540
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:07,439
um whether it's just a morphology of old

1541
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,979
Industrial Area like the rural area or

1542
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:12,238
whether there's some kind of an

1543
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,359
integrated region which you do see in

1544
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,219
Silicon Valley because it's kind of all

1545
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:20,160
organized about technology

1546
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,500
um we could perhaps argue that it used

1547
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,520
to be a global City region of yesteryear

1548
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,500
uh but perhaps the globalization was

1549
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,299
less less advanced

1550
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:33,000
there and then uh or at least it would

1551
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,580
be would be different

1552
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,319
okay just to say there's different

1553
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:39,420
conceptualization let's try to capture

1554
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,179
functions but also the morphology of

1555
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:44,040
these places and I think it's something

1556
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,100
to reflect on uh and comparing uh where

1557
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,620
you get okay

1558
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:50,520
um

1559
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,679
yeah I think in the interest of time I

1560
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:56,040
will have to move on because I I'm using

1561
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,320
a lot of words uh but I think it's

1562
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,140
important that things are clear

1563
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,480
um so second of all and I might speed up

1564
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,460
a little bit I want to give you a

1565
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,880
methodological example of how people

1566
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,160
actually dealt with this conceptual

1567
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,560
apparatus of world and Global cities in

1568
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,140
global city regions

1569
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:18,120
to measure these processes or

1570
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,179
empirically study these processes

1571
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:23,040
so this is the work by the globalization

1572
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,159
and world cities research Network

1573
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,460
um and it basically starts with

1574
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:32,100
um with a number of questions I mean

1575
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,400
uh when you look at some of these claims

1576
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,340
I mean it's it's one thing to say yeah

1577
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:41,219
we have to acknowledge world city

1578
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:42,900
formation process of global City

1579
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,640
formation process or to say that

1580
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,320
inter-urban connections are really

1581
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,600
important and actually when you start

1582
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,400
diving into this

1583
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,600
and you quickly run into into trouble

1584
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,100
um and this is actually something that

1585
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,199
that was kind of loaded already in the

1586
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:01,860
90s uh so a very long time ago but I

1587
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,900
want to give you the entire development

1588
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,060
of the agenda

1589
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,699
um that is actually quite quite few

1590
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:11,880
insight into uh world city Network

1591
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,920
formation so we had a number of case

1592
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,080
studies in the 80s and 90s especially

1593
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,719
with Sasuke assassin on a particular set

1594
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,580
of cities along the New York et cetera

1595
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,739
Etc there was all kinds of hypothesis

1596
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:24,960
and claims about the insertion in a

1597
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,699
global Urban system

1598
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,820
but actually empirically there was very

1599
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,280
little insight into this so what

1600
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,040
connects cities how Central was cities

1601
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,560
in these Urban systems

1602
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,100
I was kind of uh very much an ad hoc

1603
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,860
answer that you get to the extent that

1604
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,739
uh John Randy short said there's even a

1605
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:49,199
dirty little secret in world cities

1606
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:52,140
research actually empirically there's

1607
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,360
very little on the actual connections

1608
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,280
being made between cities so we don't

1609
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,280
really know a lot about this this is

1610
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,620
something that's uh kind of a research

1611
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:06,420
Gap to use neoliberals uh academic speak

1612
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,140
um

1613
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:09,960
that uh that the globalization and World

1614
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,860
Series research network was checked onto

1615
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,440
um and there was a number of ways of

1616
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,020
trying to to deal with that

1617
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,280
um

1618
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,500
people try to work with secondary data

1619
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,219
in the 1990s of starting 1990s thinking

1620
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:29,520
about for instance yeah uh looking at at

1621
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,000
the flows of airline passengers so our

1622
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,400
cities connected

1623
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,960
um by by Airlines

1624
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,239
this for instance gave rise to these

1625
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,460
kind of

1626
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,060
type of research and this shows you

1627
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,580
say the world city Network on the basis

1628
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,739
of Airline flows

1629
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:56,540
any idea whether this is a viable method

1630
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:00,120
can we measure the centrality of cities

1631
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,400
in the global economy by using Airline

1632
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,820
flows

1633
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,540
bill

1634
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:14,219
foreign

1635
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,780
yeah so some major airports are not

1636
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,480
necessarily in global cities yeah other

1637
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,719
ideas

1638
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,659
I couldn't find any data okay other

1639
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:42,360
kinds of sources to be used okay so the

1640
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,420
flow of Bitcoins okay yeah I'm bit more

1641
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,340
particularly with with this kind of data

1642
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:51,739
on airline flows other ideas yes

1643
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,300
traveling or

1644
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,940
absolutely different kind of attitude

1645
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:02,840
absolutely yeah other ideas

1646
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,149
[Music]

1647
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,179
that's exactly the same I mean it's

1648
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:14,340
debatable I mean are you measuring

1649
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,260
economic importance or are you measuring

1650
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:19,100
command and control

1651
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,040
yeah that was also the kind of yeah

1652
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,920
there's a hub and spoke system people

1653
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,020
write about papers flying where you

1654
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,480
don't want to go uh so it doesn't really

1655
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,640
connect I mean there's a lot of people

1656
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,400
in Reykjavik but not necessarily to um

1657
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,280
to do anything there yeah and the other

1658
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,520
ideas

1659
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,219
yeah yes yes yes absolutely yeah okay so

1660
01:14:56,219 --> 01:14:59,520
I mean it's uh I mean at First Sight you

1661
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,620
kind of can do something because it's a

1662
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:03,060
kind of intuitive picture here

1663
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,100
especially when you look at the top of

1664
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,679
the hierarchy uh so you find that New

1665
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,580
York and London is actually there uh but

1666
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,860
then you quite quickly go into all kinds

1667
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,900
of anomalies yeah

1668
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,679
these Hub airports that's that um uh are

1669
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,380
kind of not necessarily relevant tourist

1670
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,300
destinations which tell us something

1671
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,100
about economic importance but not

1672
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,780
necessarily about the importance in

1673
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,300
terms of controlling the global economy

1674
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,280
which is kind of a different kind of

1675
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,260
process

1676
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:35,580
um

1677
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,380
yeah I was going to say something else

1678
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:40,380
about that but it's yeah uh I forgot

1679
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,880
about it

1680
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,100
um yeah so we can also think about about

1681
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,860
new data Collections and

1682
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,860
um so we have Bitcoins is one way and I

1683
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:50,940
want to pick your brain a little bit

1684
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:53,340
more on that but before that I mean just

1685
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,540
saying that

1686
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:57,480
uh one of the big struggles in the 1990s

1687
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,460
that researchers Urban researchers were

1688
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,140
confronted with and this is still the

1689
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,360
case today and you'll probably note that

1690
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,420
in some of your courses is that a lot of

1691
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,060
the statistics are collected at the

1692
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,520
state level and not necessarily at the

1693
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,719
urban level

1694
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,500
and Peter Taylor uh by now Emeritus

1695
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,480
Professor that founded the globalization

1696
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,040
of world city research not to always

1697
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,920
refer to this notion of Statistics it

1698
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,620
connected to

1699
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,820
statistics and indicators that were

1700
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,320
collected by the national state to

1701
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,620
measure the national economy etc etc and

1702
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,900
at some point the centrality of cities

1703
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,760
in economic process

1704
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,659
has only Krypton uh slightly so we we

1705
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:41,699
have sometimes at the national level

1706
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:44,540
indicators about cities but then

1707
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,580
inter-city connections and flows it's

1708
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,260
very hard think about trade flows for

1709
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,179
instance

1710
01:16:50,179 --> 01:16:54,000
it's between National economies but you

1711
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,760
really have to assume that probably

1712
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,699
the major metropolitan areas will be

1713
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:01,560
more tight into this process than others

1714
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,920
yes

1715
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,620
um

1716
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,360
sorry yeah

1717
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,800
um yeah or like South American

1718
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,600
interviews and a lot of resource

1719
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,560
extraction happened in these places and

1720
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,239
uh

1721
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,860
no no but these yeah I mean it's always

1722
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,360
a question and we'll return to that

1723
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,600
about the the power of representation

1724
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,860
this is the result of when you cut off

1725
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:34,199
the list at some point so it's the most

1726
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:36,440
connected places just in terms of

1727
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,880
Passenger flows which is another reason

1728
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,080
why it's not a parade example

1729
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,159
yeah but you can turn it around and you

1730
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:50,100
can focus on Africa uh African cities

1731
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,739
and how they're connected in uh in

1732
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:55,620
global global airline networks so you

1733
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,239
could do some kind of if you will bottom

1734
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,100
of analysis and it's actually something

1735
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:00,719
that we did that we look at the

1736
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,000
evolution of African cities and global

1737
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,820
airline networks and it could tell you

1738
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:07,679
give you a hint about how these places

1739
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,620
are are internationalizing the

1740
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:13,020
globalization Global globalizing through

1741
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,480
their Airline networks but even then

1742
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,820
could still be a very rough uh rough

1743
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,739
figure and it would also as we found

1744
01:18:19,739 --> 01:18:21,960
capture other kinds of processes the

1745
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,900
liberalization of the airline industry

1746
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,020
in Africa rather than the increased

1747
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,460
importance of someone

1748
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:32,400
uh cities in the global Urban Network

1749
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,520
so yeah just just to give you an idea of

1750
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,540
what is the trouble when you start

1751
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,699
looking for new kind of data you perhaps

1752
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:41,040
can think a little bit about what other

1753
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,340
kinds of summations uh you could use

1754
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,199
and it was exactly kind of a conundrum

1755
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:48,239
or thing that that people were were

1756
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:52,320
chewing on in the 1990s and as it became

1757
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,300
evident that some kind of new meta

1758
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,780
geography uh was needed and I'm using

1759
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:01,199
meta geography in a sense uh that it

1760
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:04,320
refers to a social spatial structure if

1761
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,840
you will that helps to make sense of the

1762
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,140
world so it's a geography that explains

1763
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:15,060
uh how processes work like the nation

1764
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,460
states tells us something about to what

1765
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,520
extent uh

1766
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,520
identitarian politics is able to

1767
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,800
territorialize I mean to to make it

1768
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,020
difficult

1769
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,900
whereas uh whereas perhaps

1770
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,699
um the world city Network tries to

1771
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:36,000
capture uh the integrated fashion of

1772
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,699
economic processes and this is actually

1773
01:19:38,699 --> 01:19:39,659
what

1774
01:19:39,659 --> 01:19:42,179
uh what Manuel costells was writing

1775
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:44,460
about in the 1990s when he was talking

1776
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,400
about this space of float which you put

1777
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,440
into opposition with the space of places

1778
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,199
so he said well we have this traditional

1779
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:55,560
view of the world as a mosaic of

1780
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,480
territorial States

1781
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,480
which are kind of yeah if you put them

1782
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,300
together you get a world map but there's

1783
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,820
another kind of geography that is out

1784
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:08,239
there which is

1785
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,679
discontinuous so it's it's kind of it's

1786
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,659
not a continuous space these are kind of

1787
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:15,000
islands if you will that are connected

1788
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,800
to flows of goods people

1789
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,159
um money knowledge etc etc so this is

1790
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:25,320
kind of characterizing the space of

1791
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,300
float and it's kind of it's a

1792
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,219
socialization process this sociologist

1793
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:34,440
so as a society emerging on that and it

1794
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:38,940
was a kind of uh kind of visionary I but

1795
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:41,280
I I he intended to be Visionary in a

1796
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,380
sense that this would be the norm so we

1797
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,020
would be become the network Society we

1798
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,960
can wonder about that but what is kind

1799
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,400
of still relevant I think is that

1800
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,020
there's a tension between these spaces

1801
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,780
of flows so these islands of connected

1802
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,600
urban areas

1803
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,600
uh which is to some degree detached from

1804
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,780
a mosaic of city-states and there's all

1805
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,360
kinds of oppositions between that if you

1806
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,699
look at the election map in the UK not

1807
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:11,820
the election map the referendum map

1808
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,400
um and you look at the

1809
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,960
leaf or remain

1810
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,880
uh vote

1811
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,460
it was clear that London uh wanted to

1812
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,080
stay in which tells us something about

1813
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,900
the importance of being remaining

1814
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,280
connected to we could say other

1815
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,080
Financial Centers on the European

1816
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,480
continent the rest of Britain I mean

1817
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,060
summarizing now

1818
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:35,159
uh was was against that which shows that

1819
01:21:35,159 --> 01:21:37,320
there's a disconnect in the daily lives

1820
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:41,100
of people uh to um to to the interest of

1821
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,960
the city

1822
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,199
um I'm not saying that uh the leaf uh

1823
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:47,880
campaign actually connected to the real

1824
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,920
needs of Brits but that's another kind

1825
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,560
of discussion okay so this space is a

1826
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,179
flows served as a kind of new method

1827
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:55,980
geography which then was an impetus to

1828
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,840
start collecting new data which

1829
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,659
ultimately brings me to

1830
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:03,420
um the god heuristic and I'll try to be

1831
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,219
as brief as possible in the interest of

1832
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:07,199
time it's also not something that you

1833
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,760
need to

1834
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,860
I don't know you don't you don't study

1835
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:13,620
this by heart but it's a way uh to kind

1836
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:17,780
of appreciate a certain methodology

1837
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,420
um so just go to this website once at

1838
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:24,060
least uh it's hosted by Loughborough

1839
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,159
University in East England in the

1840
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:27,500
Midlands

1841
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,840
uh it's a very interesting source for

1842
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,340
urban level

1843
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,920
case studies uh studies on

1844
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,920
connectivities between cities that you

1845
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,600
can also use for other courses I'm

1846
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,640
thinking of the course by bus for

1847
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,860
instance so

1848
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,960
um it's quite a quite an inventory of

1849
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:49,199
nice case studies uh there so what's the

1850
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,940
starting point of this you could say

1851
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,699
project uh by globalization of World

1852
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:57,000
Series research network was is let's

1853
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,600
take APS firms as the clearest indicator

1854
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:05,340
space species of this new space of flows

1855
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,260
so there's a new space flows that

1856
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,420
characterizes how the global economy and

1857
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:12,239
Global Society works and as we read

1858
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:15,719
castell's assassin it's very likely that

1859
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:18,780
if we use these corporations we'll be

1860
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:22,800
able to indicate a command and control

1861
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,020
functions cities so the starting point

1862
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:28,080
are the geographies of APs firms to tell

1863
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,060
us something about world and Global

1864
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,239
cities

1865
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,260
the reason is as I explained earlier

1866
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,020
these APS firms rnms and of themselves

1867
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:39,659
International Players they are they have

1868
01:23:39,659 --> 01:23:42,060
a global City geography if you will so

1869
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:44,940
it makes sense to start looking into

1870
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,260
those

1871
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:48,480
and the idea is that you can actually

1872
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,219
build a model

1873
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:54,780
on the basis of these APS geographies

1874
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,659
and the model is based on

1875
01:23:57,659 --> 01:24:00,600
the co-presence the shared presence of

1876
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,320
APs firms in multiple cities

1877
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,600
summarize is one in one and whatever

1878
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,060
it will make connection between these

1879
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,219
two cities and we can assume that there

1880
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:17,340
will be some kind of flow of probably

1881
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:21,179
emails telephone calls ideas there will

1882
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:22,920
be secondments people will travel

1883
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,199
between these officers money will flow

1884
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:28,560
between these officers etc etc so the

1885
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,260
shared presence of APs firm in multiple

1886
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:33,719
cities so one firm being located in

1887
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:36,000
multiple cities so and there's three

1888
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,460
steps with any model you need to specify

1889
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:41,040
it then you can measure it it's filling

1890
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,080
it with data and then hopefully

1891
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,179
something comes out of this this model

1892
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:47,460
okay

1893
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:51,360
so yeah how does gork solve it so just

1894
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,500
as a as a random example a number of

1895
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,480
global or world cities New York London

1896
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,239
Brussels Kuala Lumpur and Hamburg

1897
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,100
and these are kind of

1898
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,280
contain spaces with a number of firms in

1899
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,820
there and these are our APS firms so

1900
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:11,880
this is a model this thing cities and

1901
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,940
they host APS firms so many firms are

1902
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:18,780
actually the same okay so we have by now

1903
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,780
uh transformed uh corporations such as

1904
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:23,880
Audra Anderson Lesnar Von Clifford

1905
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,739
chance the law firm Bruce Allen Hamilton

1906
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:29,340
Lloyds as an insurance company so just

1907
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,679
to give you some impressions

1908
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,739
so how is it specified what does God do

1909
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:37,920
it says well oh there's a firm here in

1910
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,900
London or Brussels

1911
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:42,540
how important is this firm actually okay

1912
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:45,179
so you try to measure this in an

1913
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:47,760
objective or at least standardized way

1914
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,560
so that you make the same error every

1915
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:53,580
time or that you write every time so you

1916
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,920
say okay for this one office in Brussels

1917
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,400
by Barclays or something or HSBC a bank

1918
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,739
how important is it and we use a very

1919
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:04,620
standard scale zero to five no offers ah

1920
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:07,560
easy you give it a zero uh oh it's the

1921
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,659
global headquarters then it's a five

1922
01:26:09,659 --> 01:26:11,280
okay and throughout the agent you see

1923
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,679
but it would be I don't know KBC or

1924
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,960
something like that large Belgium tank

1925
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,360
okay and then there's a whole range in

1926
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,380
between

1927
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:22,620
a typical office would be two maybe a

1928
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,239
regional headquarters and there's a lot

1929
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,760
of those in Brussels that actually

1930
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:30,179
control European activities uh would be

1931
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:32,460
a three or a four

1932
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,199
um so yeah this is kind of the idea

1933
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:37,080
there's a hierarchy and office functions

1934
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,120
and we can measure this in a

1935
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,760
standardized way

1936
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,440
nervous values

1937
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:47,460
so imagine what the importance of of uh

1938
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,739
the connection between uh two offices

1939
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:53,460
would be so a very important office in

1940
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:54,420
Brussels

1941
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:57,420
a very important office in London would

1942
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:00,360
probably generate more traffic in terms

1943
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,300
of emails than phone calls which is then

1944
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,760
again a proxy for you could say the

1945
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,980
importance of the activities in global

1946
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:10,380
command temperature okay so it's

1947
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,840
basically calculating the Intercity

1948
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,060
relation the R value there

1949
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:18,420
by multiplying these service values so

1950
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:20,580
very basic so you have a very important

1951
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,920
one times a very important one gives you

1952
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,380
a very strong relation between these two

1953
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,120
places okay

1954
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,100
it looks a bit like that you can imagine

1955
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:30,840
the connection so

1956
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,820
the thicker the line the more important

1957
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,380
the connection between these kind of

1958
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,560
offices uh and yeah

1959
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,739
you can populate a complete Matrix with

1960
01:27:40,739 --> 01:27:43,440
that you could do that in Infinity until

1961
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,179
you drop that or you don't have the

1962
01:27:45,179 --> 01:27:48,600
energy to look for more information on

1963
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,940
office networks okay so but this is kind

1964
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,920
of the basic model and it allows you to

1965
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,600
do for instance this kind of thing so

1966
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,239
there's three cities in this very short

1967
01:27:57,239 --> 01:28:00,780
list we drop Singapore and work and they

1968
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:03,480
have these different kind of firms APS

1969
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,000
firm a b c and d and we can could

1970
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,840
imagine a bubble where you say okay and

1971
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:14,159
firm a has a global office in New York

1972
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,040
um a very important office uh or a

1973
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,719
regular office in Singapore and a

1974
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:20,100
regular officer

1975
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,860
and it would be a bit different for b c

1976
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,659
and d okay

1977
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:28,380
so just one example out of thin air

1978
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:32,239
what you can then do is start to measure

1979
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,699
uh the connectivity of cities

1980
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:38,940
thus far we've been talking about

1981
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,440
first

1982
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,020
and what the importance of the city is a

1983
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,780
referral you can also think about what

1984
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:48,360
is now the strength of a city's

1985
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,760
connection based on the on the presence

1986
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,820
of firms so what you do is you basically

1987
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,699
summarize all these different ties

1988
01:28:56,699 --> 01:29:00,540
between cities for one uh for one city

1989
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,000
okay sounds a bit complex but it really

1990
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,540
isn't so what you would do is think

1991
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:09,020
about the connection between different

1992
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,580
cities on the basis of the corporate

1993
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,219
Network so think about five times two

1994
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:17,520
plus five times two would be the

1995
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,159
connectivity generated by first theorem

1996
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:23,400
doesn't be four times two New York would

1997
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:27,719
be five times one uh in addition to that

1998
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:31,560
and two times five and in some you would

1999
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,380
get a figure of 48 that's purely a

2000
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:36,600
relevant example but it would give you

2001
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,139
the highest connectivity in uh in this

2002
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:42,179
model right and then for the other kind

2003
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:44,100
of cities we could do a similar exercise

2004
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,380
for instance

2005
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,060
it wouldn't be generating connectivities

2006
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:50,639
for firm A and D because there's no

2007
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:52,739
presence for these terms so you could

2008
01:29:52,739 --> 01:29:55,800
generate some connectivity or a and for

2009
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,820
C it can also summarize that and what

2010
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,800
you could also do is Express this as a

2011
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,139
proportion of the most connected City in

2012
01:30:04,139 --> 01:30:06,360
this tiny example of New York and you

2013
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,840
would get to say well entrance is four

2014
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,440
tenths connected as well as New York so

2015
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,960
New York is is our leading we're all

2016
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,420
sitting here then we have Singapore and

2017
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:20,540
then enter okay so a very very small

2018
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:24,360
example to tell you how to structure

2019
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:27,360
okay service values thinking about

2020
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,760
connections between cities and then

2021
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,520
summarizing these connections that gives

2022
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,860
us an overall view of the productivity

2023
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:39,540
of a city in the world uh sitting okay

2024
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:43,260
so we have specified the model and then

2025
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,060
you can start measuring it and filling

2026
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,840
it with data

2027
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:52,980
um and how has gork done this well the

2028
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,960
specification obviously refers to the

2029
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,699
aps firms and um and it's kind of nice

2030
01:30:58,699 --> 01:31:01,920
is that this measurement has occurred

2031
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,679
several times since I think 2000 but

2032
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:06,780
every time in the same way so kind of

2033
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:10,199
definitions of uh of categories of this

2034
01:31:10,199 --> 01:31:12,540
kind of APs sectors has remained the

2035
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:15,000
same there has been numerous kind of

2036
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,699
reiterations of these measures so five

2037
01:31:17,699 --> 01:31:19,980
sectors are are connected to substance

2038
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,080
interpretation currency advertising

2039
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,780
Financial Services traditional insurance

2040
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:26,639
law and management consultancy

2041
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,780
basically what God does is the leading

2042
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:35,159
firms 175 verbs based on Forbes and

2043
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:37,340
other kinds of corporate corporate lists

2044
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:40,080
uh that tells something about turnover

2045
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,980
the size of these phrase etc etc uh are

2046
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:46,280
kind of selected

2047
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:50,699
and then what is also done is is yeah

2048
01:31:50,699 --> 01:31:52,620
you could do this with an infinite

2049
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:55,020
number of cities well not infinite but a

2050
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:58,080
very large list of cities but uh to

2051
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,060
avoid a bit of I don't know it's not

2052
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,440
bias but to

2053
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,080
together manageable data set you could

2054
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,080
say the largest cities or what we know

2055
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,940
from certain countries as economically

2056
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,239
important cities are selected in this

2057
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:14,219
list so it's not a purely inductive

2058
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:16,739
exercise it's kind of an informed

2059
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:19,620
decision to include some uh cities and

2060
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:22,080
other colors so a lot of firms a lot of

2061
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,960
cities and then on the basis of

2062
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,780
information uh that we that we can find

2063
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:31,340
on corporate websites we make a decision

2064
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:35,159
as to how important offices are

2065
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:38,280
and then you can basically start uh

2066
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,620
filling an entire Matrix so just an

2067
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:44,580
example uh to to share a bit of how this

2068
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,960
works I mean if you think about just

2069
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,000
look at the website can be quite tough

2070
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,340
but you can actually although a lot of

2071
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:52,560
these websites find very detailed

2072
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,500
information coming at the address level

2073
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:58,260
of uh of these offices and a lot of

2074
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,360
these corporations are very proud that

2075
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,159
they're located in the meeting world

2076
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:05,460
cities kind of a branding so quite often

2077
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:08,659
you can find that yes

2078
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,159
uh yes

2079
01:33:11,159 --> 01:33:13,560
to avoid defenestration that's a very

2080
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,040
good idea

2081
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:19,320
I think yeah I'm not sure whether it's

2082
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:22,199
going to take away all the noise that

2083
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:25,020
that's what you're aiming at

2084
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:27,900
um so yeah so it's um

2085
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:30,000
it's a freely accessible source of

2086
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,800
information

2087
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,080
but obviously

2088
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,620
um it's also a bit of guesswork it needs

2089
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,380
to come up with some kind of

2090
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:42,800
interpretive guide to to reach

2091
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,960
uh these websites and to make decisions

2092
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,719
as to how you will uh give attachive

2093
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:52,860
value to these stories okay just one uh

2094
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:55,260
for example and then you can build this

2095
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,060
kind of matrices

2096
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:00,179
so all the firms in a lot of countries a

2097
01:34:00,179 --> 01:34:02,580
lot of cities and then you can start

2098
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:05,040
applying that problem okay so it's an

2099
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,020
approximation of the importance of

2100
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:09,420
cities in these corporate networks uh

2101
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:11,580
and it has delivered a kind of sustained

2102
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,920
analysis or modeling of these

2103
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:17,580
interactions uh on that basis

2104
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:20,159
and then maybe you already have seen

2105
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,860
this kind of maps so a lot of uh world

2106
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:25,980
city Network research and start to look

2107
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:28,500
uh into the actual geography that we

2108
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,679
produced so this is some research uh

2109
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:33,719
from a while ago

2110
01:34:33,719 --> 01:34:37,320
um it just shows the the absolute levels

2111
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,420
of connectivity so the global network

2112
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:41,880
connectivity and the darker practices

2113
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,360
are the most connected places and then

2114
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,800
uh the lower

2115
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,940
um the lighter colors so it gives you an

2116
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:54,420
idea take a good look at this map

2117
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:56,580
what you learn from that or where you

2118
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:59,940
find striking

2119
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:04,820
anything striking here

2120
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,880
does it confirm what you thought

2121
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,320
you learn new things

2122
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:14,639
yeah

2123
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:16,260
no

2124
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:20,480
yes I am I'm pretty sure

2125
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:25,320
this is the world mapping there are lots

2126
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,360
of human things

2127
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,360
so why are there so many Europeans to be

2128
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:31,800
selected like you said like if you're

2129
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,980
kind of making the largest cities

2130
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,840
in Europe we don't have the largest

2131
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:40,800
number of populations so I I don't think

2132
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,920
no so but it's it's a list uh so this

2133
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,260
there's a number of criteria I mean

2134
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:49,520
population is one but it's also in in

2135
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,620
certain countries I mean uh is also

2136
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:55,199
looking forward to basically with known

2137
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:59,040
economic importance so in Belgium uh it

2138
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,320
would also include Francisco

2139
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,600
uh which is absolutely another two

2140
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,600
million uh inhabitant cities so but we

2141
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,960
know it has important board activities

2142
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,659
just to be clear these are not 525

2143
01:36:12,659 --> 01:36:15,719
cities within selection I think it's 123

2144
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:18,719
so it's focusing on the most connected

2145
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:21,960
cities uh which as a result

2146
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,239
apparently gives

2147
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:27,120
a geography that is skewed towards

2148
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,060
it's a North America Western Europe and

2149
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:34,159
then has a bit of presence elsewhere

2150
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:36,679
yep

2151
01:36:36,679 --> 01:36:40,760
it seems like this

2152
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:43,760
is

2153
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:47,219
like that like there's like a whole lot

2154
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:48,960
of economic relationships that are

2155
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,360
Global that that business like that is

2156
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,060
absolutely a good case relationship

2157
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,679
um you know which like on an individual

2158
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,300
level are probably not put the money but

2159
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,900
like yeah

2160
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:10,139
I I agree 300 so the question is I mean

2161
01:37:10,139 --> 01:37:11,580
does this represent citizen

2162
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:14,280
globalization or does it represent the

2163
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:17,880
location strategies of APs firms and to

2164
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,880
what extent is this the same so it's

2165
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,980
it's the question is to what extent you

2166
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:26,100
go along and they claim that ABS firms

2167
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:28,139
are an indicated species of commandment

2168
01:37:28,139 --> 01:37:29,280
control

2169
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,699
I think to some extent this is the case

2170
01:37:31,699 --> 01:37:34,260
but there's clearly other processes but

2171
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:35,699
I think and that's something that will

2172
01:37:35,699 --> 01:37:39,000
return to later on uh

2173
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,980
we have to I think another key

2174
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:42,780
distinguish between say more economic

2175
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:46,020
geography readings whereas there's also

2176
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:48,000
more urban studies critiques some people

2177
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,199
would say that you're not capturing

2178
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:50,900
globalization here

2179
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,400
and there's other process we should look

2180
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,500
at yes that's true but it doesn't

2181
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,780
discredit one particular reading or one

2182
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,520
particular focus on the process as long

2183
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,080
as we're clear about what it is it

2184
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,820
measures and what it is that it doesn't

2185
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,620
but if I complete the example that

2186
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,300
remittances I'll return to that in a

2187
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,280
second is is

2188
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:11,340
um it's very appropriate so this we have

2189
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,560
to be careful that we that we

2190
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,360
we're not switching to some kind of

2191
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,820
Imperial uh

2192
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:21,780
act here uh to try to claim that one

2193
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:24,120
process dominate something but if we're

2194
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,520
specific we can say something

2195
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,460
same here it's uh the same period That's

2196
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,880
a kind of comparison uh between two

2197
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,580
periods in time if we I mean there was a

2198
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,620
data collection and allows analysis in

2199
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:41,280
2000 and then just before the crisis uh

2200
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,040
in 2008 I mean the previous crisis I

2201
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,320
mean I'm getting old

2202
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,260
um so comparing uh the structure of the

2203
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,000
world city Network which is effectively

2204
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,699
on the aggregate level

2205
01:38:53,699 --> 01:38:56,219
um the structure of corporate strategies

2206
01:38:56,219 --> 01:38:59,280
and their geographies and I mean it's

2207
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,199
kind of interesting to see that even

2208
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:04,139
before uh the euro-american or North

2209
01:39:04,139 --> 01:39:06,420
Atlantic financial crisis there was

2210
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:08,159
already a shift going on in terms of

2211
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,219
strategic importance of cities in the

2212
01:39:11,219 --> 01:39:13,739
East and I mean both in Eastern Europe

2213
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:17,280
and uh the global east so I'm talking

2214
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,040
about uh Chinese cities for instance so

2215
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,199
if for instance we're interested in in

2216
01:39:22,199 --> 01:39:24,540
secular shifts within the structure of

2217
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:27,600
the world economy it shows that it's

2218
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,340
also reflected in the corporate

2219
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:32,040
geographies of these APS firms

2220
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,360
which

2221
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,400
knowing that they're important inputs

2222
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,739
for Global corporations tells us

2223
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:39,780
something about the relevance of these

2224
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:43,440
cities and how Capital circulates on the

2225
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,480
global scale so it tells us something

2226
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,120
that everything and that's also and

2227
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:52,500
that's also why Rob uses heuristic and

2228
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,300
that there's some modestly connected to

2229
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,340
that heuristic is a kind of a starting

2230
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,620
point it's a searching device

2231
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:01,440
when you say oh what the hell is going

2232
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,699
on in

2233
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:04,940
let's say Miami

2234
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:07,980
it's dark red what could be the process

2235
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:11,159
going on how does it explain that how do

2236
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:12,900
you explain that it's one of the worst

2237
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,900
uh performers if you will and lost so

2238
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:17,580
much connectivity where it's a very

2239
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:19,739
important Transit Hub between Latin

2240
01:40:19,739 --> 01:40:23,580
America and a North America

2241
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:27,120
is why is it losing its functions uh is

2242
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,460
it because Latin America is becoming

2243
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:32,639
less important or uh for North American

2244
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:36,060
Capital uh what could be going on there

2245
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,380
I mean you can think about numerous

2246
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:40,560
other examples uh there and it should be

2247
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,360
I think and that's how I personally use

2248
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:45,179
it the starting point for analysis and a

2249
01:40:45,179 --> 01:40:46,620
different set to a different set of

2250
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:49,800
methods you could do a case study

2251
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:52,139
follow the thing follow your nose and

2252
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:54,060
try to problematize these kind of

2253
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:57,360
filings but it's a way to refer to refer

2254
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,699
back to that and it gives you and that's

2255
01:40:59,699 --> 01:41:01,620
I think the added value some kind of

2256
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:04,880
standardized overview

2257
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:06,780
there's a lot of things that's further

2258
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:08,639
that we can say about that

2259
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:09,239
um

2260
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:12,719
I really need to press on uh because

2261
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:14,400
it's taking a bit more time than

2262
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,920
expected are you still okay to proceed I

2263
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,320
promise that we won't take 25 minutes

2264
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,360
but maybe 20 minutes

2265
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,580
if I'm lucky

2266
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,219
is that okay or you want a break

2267
01:41:25,219 --> 01:41:28,520
otherwise it's going to take

2268
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,780
yes you can

2269
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:33,300
um yeah is there a collective need for a

2270
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,000
restroom break

2271
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,760
is that a yes hand okay

2272
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,040
uh yeah two minutes because we really

2273
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,179
because

2274
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:46,199
we can't take too much time so

2275
01:41:46,199 --> 01:41:49,920
if you project that in 20 minutes your

2276
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,739
bladder will break uh go now

2277
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:01,760

[Music]

2308
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:35,520
so yeah just one thing that you should

2309
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,980
appreciate by now a long tradition of

2310
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:40,320
Rural and Global cities research then

2311
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,320
this kind of empirically informative but

2312
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:45,719
at some point and especially the early

2313
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:49,199
2000s there was a danger that or at

2314
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:51,739
least this research agenda was was

2315
01:48:51,739 --> 01:48:54,060
interpreted as you could say dominant or

2316
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:57,480
hegemonic even uh within Urban studies

2317
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:00,179
or citizen globalization and as such it

2318
01:49:00,179 --> 01:49:03,840
also raised quite a bit of criticism

2319
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,179
um and I think it's debatable to what

2320
01:49:06,179 --> 01:49:08,040
extent this is just quite at some points

2321
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,139
it certainly is for the points I think

2322
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:12,480
I'm personally but I'm also kind of

2323
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,940
involved in these debates a bit more in

2324
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:17,100
the wild well just take you through them

2325
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:19,440
uh and I hope to do so within the next

2326
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,540
uh 20 minutes

2327
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:24,960
right uh I think we could say I still

2328
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,719
think that the heuristic can be powerful

2329
01:49:27,719 --> 01:49:29,520
to the map and spatially analyze Global

2330
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,940
Connections but uh clearly something can

2331
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:35,040
be said that I'll just skip that and cut

2332
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,440
the business one of the most important

2333
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,840
uh could be a more most trenching

2334
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,060
critiques was launched at the beginning

2335
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:46,739
of the Northeast by a famous

2336
01:49:46,739 --> 01:49:50,280
um scholar Jennifer Robinson

2337
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,920
um a South African uh working from

2338
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:53,880
London

2339
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:57,719
uh wrote a book uh ordinary cities or

2340
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:00,659
whatever uh papers was

2341
01:50:00,659 --> 01:50:03,239
um world cities or a world of cities

2342
01:50:03,239 --> 01:50:06,119
where she kind of

2343
01:50:06,119 --> 01:50:08,340
um or was a bit frustrated with with

2344
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:11,639
this dominance of world cities uh

2345
01:50:11,639 --> 01:50:13,619
research in the debate about citizen

2346
01:50:13,619 --> 01:50:16,260
globalization and it says she says well

2347
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:17,820
it's quite a different thing to talk

2348
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,560
about world cities or to be interested

2349
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:21,659
in a globalization of cities more widely

2350
01:50:21,659 --> 01:50:24,719
right and that's good reasons for this

2351
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,900
difference or the kind of the lack of of

2352
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:29,820
what role in global cities research was

2353
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:31,739
doing then in addressing cities in

2354
01:50:31,739 --> 01:50:34,800
globalization since and we've seen the

2355
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,500
maps a lot of the cities around the

2356
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,540
globe and especially in the global South

2357
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:41,520
are basically dropped off

2358
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,179
the physical literal map right so we

2359
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:47,460
find that there's a lot of connectivity

2360
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:50,880
in European Western European North

2361
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,340
American Asian cities but there's

2362
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:55,500
actually very little to be told about

2363
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,300
African cities they're basically not

2364
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:59,280
represented police

2365
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,980
so it's an issue of representation there

2366
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:04,219
in her view

2367
01:51:04,219 --> 01:51:07,139
uh but it also deals with

2368
01:51:07,139 --> 01:51:09,719
um with how we conceptualize uh world

2369
01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:13,500
and Globe cities and in her argument

2370
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:16,080
um we've focused too much on a limited

2371
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,719
number of economic processes whereas all

2372
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:21,239
the kind of connections remain unsteady

2373
01:51:21,239 --> 01:51:23,880
and one of the examples that was already

2374
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:25,679
given was yeah you can look at

2375
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,840
remittances and you would get a

2376
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,360
completely different view perhaps

2377
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:33,840
on these Urban Networks

2378
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:36,960
so when her kind of claim is that

2379
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:40,139
by doing so by these say geographical

2380
01:51:40,139 --> 01:51:42,960
conceptual biases World Series research

2381
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,760
has ignored role in position of numerous

2382
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:46,619
ordinary cities in the global economy

2383
01:51:46,619 --> 01:51:49,260
and there's a tendency

2384
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:53,159
to uh you could say offer a eurocentric

2385
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:56,699
global City Theory and then projecting

2386
01:51:56,699 --> 01:52:00,119
that in other areas of the world so a

2387
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:01,860
post-colonial critique

2388
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:04,800
it's concerned with people say power

2389
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,199
relations in the production

2390
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:11,639
of theories and Concepts and how these

2391
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:15,360
Concepts and theories are reproducing

2392
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,760
uh existing inequalities and there's

2393
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:20,400
these are also geographical so it's a

2394
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,260
social spatial and evenness at the

2395
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,940
global scale

2396
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:27,060
we keep on kind of reiterating the

2397
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,580
dominance of certain kinds of activities

2398
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:31,800
come up with certain kind of maps

2399
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,860
measuring things in a certain way in the

2400
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:36,840
end we're part of the process and part

2401
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,480
of the problem if you will

2402
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,340
I think there's certainly an argument

2403
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:43,980
had to be made there

2404
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:46,080
um I think representation is problematic

2405
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:49,199
in my own research that was also kind of

2406
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:51,060
the starting point of why I was

2407
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:53,460
interested in looking into uh Islamic

2408
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:56,159
Finance as a way to understand Middle

2409
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:57,920
Eastern

2410
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,080
uh World City information processes not

2411
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:03,780
to a traditional lens of the classic APS

2412
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:07,199
firms but to look at okay to what extent

2413
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:10,020
or local norms and ethics religious and

2414
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:13,380
other regarding Finance

2415
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:16,560
um giving rice to a global sector and

2416
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:19,020
that's in and of its own that could then

2417
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:21,139
also start allow us to unpack

2418
01:53:21,139 --> 01:53:23,400
inter-urban connections that was kind of

2419
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:25,920
what I did in my uh my own work on

2420
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:28,860
Islamic Finance so I I certainly am

2421
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:31,320
extremely sensitive uh to this outcome

2422
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:34,739
but at the same time we also have to uh

2423
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:36,719
be clear that that part of this

2424
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:39,600
criticism perhaps also out of place I

2425
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,760
think uh Jennifer Robinson really starts

2426
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:44,100
from an urban studies critique and she

2427
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:46,199
wants to understand

2428
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:48,300
um you could say globalization and its

2429
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:50,400
plurality not just economic but

2430
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,380
otherwise and even within economic

2431
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:56,400
processes why diversity whereas for gork

2432
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,860
I think the purpose is how can we

2433
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:00,780
understand the reproduction of uneven

2434
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:02,699
development on a global scale at least

2435
01:54:02,699 --> 01:54:06,239
in the freedomanian tradition where it

2436
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:07,260
was about

2437
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:10,020
how can we explain it indeed the fact

2438
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,360
that that there's still under

2439
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:15,480
development in Andre the Frank's terms

2440
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:18,060
in in the global South does it have

2441
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:19,679
something to do with the supporting the

2442
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:22,679
position of these cities and macro

2443
01:54:22,679 --> 01:54:25,920
processes macro macro capitalist process

2444
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,920
so is it something with

2445
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:31,500
the extraction of value organized

2446
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,060
through these corporate networks and

2447
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:35,040
supported by its APS firms that actually

2448
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:37,560
explains why these cities are not on the

2449
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:40,020
map so is this a result

2450
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:43,500
uh is this not a neglect on this place

2451
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,060
it's the fact that these places are not

2452
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:47,580
represented means they're either

2453
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:50,219
bypassed by these core protectors or

2454
01:54:50,219 --> 01:54:51,600
that they potentially are are

2455
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,520
subordinating in this process

2456
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,619
which could then be a question of is

2457
01:54:55,619 --> 01:54:57,139
this really the case

2458
01:54:57,139 --> 01:55:00,060
uh can we look into this processor so

2459
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:02,460
sometimes a bit of a confusion I think

2460
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:05,340
uh between kind of a deliberate choice

2461
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:08,159
not to include certain places whereas

2462
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:09,600
some of these maps are actually to be

2463
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:11,880
taken as as a result of a critical

2464
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:13,440
analysis

2465
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:17,400
I do agree that in a number of you could

2466
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:19,320
say analysis that are more technical in

2467
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:21,960
nature uh in terms of the world city

2468
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,300
Network this kind of critical Edge was

2469
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:26,639
sometimes lost and there's a kind of a

2470
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,980
mission drift towards mapping networks

2471
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:30,900
whereas the connection to process of

2472
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:33,060
uneven development was less clear that's

2473
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:34,800
a bit of my personal

2474
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,159
uh crusade to um to make the connection

2475
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:41,639
uh to the Critical Agenda again so this

2476
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:43,619
but certainly

2477
01:55:43,619 --> 01:55:46,020
um Jennifer Robertson points us to to be

2478
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:49,080
very clear about what it is that we are

2479
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:51,179
measuring through this kind of goal

2480
01:55:51,179 --> 01:55:52,920
analysis and what we're not so it's

2481
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:55,619
about placing them these kind of methods

2482
01:55:55,619 --> 01:55:59,520
in a wider uh you could say firmament of

2483
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:04,199
of methods uh two to work with that

2484
01:56:04,199 --> 01:56:06,540
now it does also connect to what kind of

2485
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:09,840
practice uh we which we wish to endorse

2486
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:12,540
within the tradition of urban studies

2487
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:15,420
in the sense that uh and this is kind of

2488
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:16,679
our

2489
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:18,739
um or my personal

2490
01:56:18,739 --> 01:56:21,060
disappointment with a lot of research

2491
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:23,760
that has followed the work by Jennifer

2492
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:27,119
Robinson from the South but there's a

2493
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:29,100
lot of tendency with weird rich Jennifer

2494
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:33,860
or Jenny uh and a very reductionist

2495
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:36,239
representation of her legitimate claims

2496
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,159
claims and we we actually wrote a paper

2497
01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:41,460
about this with the egregious title uh

2498
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:44,760
kind of straw man speak uh where we kind

2499
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,440
of deal with

2500
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:48,540
um with distilling what is kind of

2501
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:50,699
Justified criticism and where we think

2502
01:56:50,699 --> 01:56:53,219
it's a bit too much and what we

2503
01:56:53,219 --> 01:56:56,460
particularly regrets is that some of

2504
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:58,639
this criticism has led to

2505
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:02,100
disengaged or polemic pluralism where

2506
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:04,380
it's a kind of rejection certain agendas

2507
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:07,020
to do something else without taking

2508
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,060
stock about of the knowledge that is

2509
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:12,239
produced there so what we try to then

2510
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:13,980
propose is some kind of a middle ground

2511
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:17,280
is a more engaged form of urban studies

2512
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,900
debate which also means that you can say

2513
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:21,139
yes

2514
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:23,580
like analysis analysis or relatively

2515
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:25,619
research in general

2516
01:57:25,619 --> 01:57:27,719
we need to put it in its place but it

2517
01:57:27,719 --> 01:57:29,219
doesn't mean that we can try to work

2518
01:57:29,219 --> 01:57:31,260
with this Concepts to make sense of

2519
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:32,599
places

2520
01:57:32,599 --> 01:57:35,760
beyond the short list of world cities

2521
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,500
could be that I'm babbling and I'm

2522
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,780
defending on explaining myself in

2523
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:41,520
different kind of ways in unnecessary

2524
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,860
ways but let me try to make it more

2525
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:49,139
clear uh you can say ah Beirut Manila we

2526
01:57:49,139 --> 01:57:52,260
don't need a world city Concepts it's uh

2527
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:54,420
well the world city is a euro-american

2528
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:58,080
invention can't do anything with that

2529
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:59,940
uh it could be something that you could

2530
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:02,820
say uh they say yeah we need the concept

2531
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:04,679
of the middle eastern city of the Asian

2532
01:58:04,679 --> 01:58:06,420
City because everything is particular

2533
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:09,840
and then we need to build that theory uh

2534
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,699
and then it's so unique and particular

2535
01:58:11,699 --> 01:58:13,619
that you you can't do anything

2536
01:58:13,619 --> 01:58:15,119
so

2537
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:18,599
people disagree and say look

2538
01:58:18,599 --> 01:58:21,480
there's no one-on-one projection of

2539
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:24,780
world city formation as a process on a

2540
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:27,800
city like Beirut for instance or Manila

2541
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:30,360
uh but we'll have to work with the

2542
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:32,340
concept to see to an extent it does

2543
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:34,020
explain something of what we find and

2544
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:36,360
what extent it doesn't and perhaps we

2545
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:41,659
need to enhance or tailor uh diversify

2546
01:58:41,659 --> 01:58:43,739
the concepts

2547
01:58:43,739 --> 01:58:46,080
and in the process we potentially may

2548
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,880
even learn something about the place

2549
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:50,880
that we we study but at least we still

2550
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,040
remain in a position that we can speak

2551
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,739
back to the original debate which is I

2552
01:58:55,739 --> 01:58:57,540
think the point of urban studies that

2553
01:58:57,540 --> 01:58:59,340
were not Lost in Translation but try to

2554
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:03,060
connect to some kind of organized or

2555
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:05,159
overarching debate even if you're

2556
01:59:05,159 --> 01:59:08,520
studying in very diverse places

2557
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,619
now yeah I won't say too much about

2558
01:59:10,619 --> 01:59:12,480
these two cases because it's also part

2559
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,639
of our discussion seminar but just to

2560
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:16,920
point down the kind of contrasting cases

2561
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:20,280
uh so in one paper we looked at Beirut

2562
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:22,440
um which is kind of an interesting place

2563
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:26,280
I mean we call it a city more by X path

2564
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:29,040
uh we're also the formation processes so

2565
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:32,340
what you see is a built environment uh

2566
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:34,380
with skyscrapers

2567
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:36,420
um they obviously took a hit and are

2568
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:40,020
taking a serious hit uh currently uh

2569
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:41,940
with the the entire term of the country

2570
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:43,860
isn't

2571
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:45,840
um but on the first side you would say

2572
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:47,760
okay there's actually when you start

2573
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:50,040
looking at APS activities it's actually

2574
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,320
very little going on there there's a lot

2575
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,719
of very little Regional headquarters

2576
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:56,820
there's very little International firms

2577
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:59,340
but when you then start looking into yes

2578
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:02,699
remittance flows or and and the diaspora

2579
02:00:02,699 --> 02:00:04,560
you find that almost one-fifth of

2580
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:07,199
Lebanese economy is made of out of these

2581
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:09,360
remittances and a lot of it braces back

2582
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:12,060
to ABS professionals that are located in

2583
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:15,440
the Gulf so it's our it's our McKinsey

2584
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:18,900
trained pedigree Consultants McKinsey

2585
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:21,480
Liberty that is then advising the Saudis

2586
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:23,760
or people in Dubai the Elites in Dubai

2587
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,699
that earn their money there uh send back

2588
02:00:26,699 --> 02:00:30,780
their money and buy a hugely overpriced

2589
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:34,460
apartment in the city center of Beirut

2590
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:36,840
at the real estate market which is then

2591
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:40,500
kept artificially booming by almost free

2592
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:42,480
credits from the Central Bank of Lebanon

2593
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:45,060
which is also the personal property of

2594
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:47,400
the living families of

2595
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:51,599
um of Lebanon so it's kind of connected

2596
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:54,060
um now in any case uh it shows you that

2597
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:57,420
if you follow your nose in a sense there

2598
02:00:57,420 --> 02:00:59,880
still are some characteristics of world

2599
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:02,699
city formation especially in the role of

2600
02:01:02,699 --> 02:01:05,580
high skilled labor but it's a kind of

2601
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:07,920
it's it's an impressive Regional

2602
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,360
capacity building

2603
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:12,900
Regional uh circuits of value that are

2604
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:15,420
kind of connected back to the city

2605
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:17,580
yeah

2606
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:19,080
um so it's function as a kind of a

2607
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,420
capital city to the region rather than

2608
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:24,360
as a kind of server service deliveries

2609
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:26,760
if you look at Manila it's kind of the

2610
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:28,860
opposite you'd say wow a lot of

2611
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:30,900
activities there a lot of APs firms

2612
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:33,599
they're all there but then you when you

2613
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:35,340
start looking into these activities and

2614
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:36,840
there's something that Rihanna gleibert

2615
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,040
has done

2616
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,980
it's basically part of the largest one

2617
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:42,900
of the largest Outsourcing sectors of

2618
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:45,840
Tendencies uh that you find so a lot of

2619
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,719
back office activities for Global Banks

2620
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:51,360
and other kind of service providers but

2621
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:54,360
it's not really command and control or

2622
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:57,020
not at least not what we think of it

2623
02:01:57,020 --> 02:02:00,840
and it may also work through and what it

2624
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:02,580
can explain in terms of the segmentation

2625
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:04,380
of the labor market but because it would

2626
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:07,380
not be high-end managers that are then

2627
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:10,020
gentrifying neighborhoods

2628
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:11,760
but it may give rise through a middle

2629
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:14,040
class or something so it may result in

2630
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:16,920
other kinds of Labor Market structures

2631
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:19,320
but at least we can still refer back to

2632
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:21,179
world cities and start comparing to what

2633
02:02:21,179 --> 02:02:22,139
is going on

2634
02:02:22,139 --> 02:02:24,179
so this is an example of an income

2635
02:02:24,179 --> 02:02:27,500
passing approach to try to encompass

2636
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:29,880
diversity in your research design and

2637
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:32,040
try to make sense of it okay so that's

2638
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,179
how we solve it I won't say anything

2639
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:34,860
more because I want to leave something

2640
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:38,699
for the debating session

2641
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:42,900
second uh point of criticism is uh

2642
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:45,360
social constructivist critique

2643
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,639
um again a bit the same in the sense

2644
02:02:47,639 --> 02:02:51,840
that representation matters and this is

2645
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:56,400
the great work by Dory Massey uh who was

2646
02:02:56,400 --> 02:03:00,659
a uh trying to say nice economic

2647
02:03:00,659 --> 02:03:04,040
geographer from the UK

2648
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,280
um

2649
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:07,320
thought about spatial divisions of labor

2650
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:09,599
was one of the leading voices and and a

2651
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:11,820
lot of progressive debates uh in

2652
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:13,920
geography

2653
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:16,199
um and she also wrote a book

2654
02:03:16,199 --> 02:03:19,619
world city in 2007 uh where she kind of

2655
02:03:19,619 --> 02:03:23,580
engaged with with this agenda

2656
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:24,780
and

2657
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:26,880
um what she basically says in this book

2658
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,560
is

2659
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,360
um yeah

2660
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:31,139
um

2661
02:03:31,139 --> 02:03:35,280
world cities are not just a given an

2662
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:38,460
economic geographical reality based on

2663
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:41,340
as we set the clustering of these abs

2664
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:44,040
firms their labor markets Etc

2665
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:46,739
but they are but they're also a product

2666
02:03:46,739 --> 02:03:51,840
of uh discourses representation

2667
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:55,560
etc etc so they're mediated by political

2668
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:57,599
interests

2669
02:03:57,599 --> 02:04:01,500
um Elites others and other actors that

2670
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:04,679
project certain discourses about world

2671
02:04:04,679 --> 02:04:07,080
and Global cities and these also have

2672
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:10,679
ultimately uh performative effects so

2673
02:04:10,679 --> 02:04:13,199
they they produce or co-produce certain

2674
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:15,659
realities okay so that's kind of

2675
02:04:15,659 --> 02:04:18,440
knowledge Theory so the world

2676
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:21,719
is also to some extent shaped by how you

2677
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:24,599
represent this and then you can can be

2678
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:27,060
an Ardent very strong believer of that

2679
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:29,000
and say okay the world is almost

2680
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,139
exclusively reducible to how we

2681
02:04:31,139 --> 02:04:33,119
represented whereas others would work

2682
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:35,280
more in the kind of materials fragrance

2683
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,199
okay not everything is shaped by words

2684
02:04:37,199 --> 02:04:39,920
right so

2685
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:44,159
something to think about at what extent

2686
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:47,040
Rapid Station actually matters now

2687
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:50,820
during uh explains this for London

2688
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:52,679
and she says yes it's a globalized

2689
02:04:52,679 --> 02:04:54,900
financial center but the way we perceive

2690
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:56,460
it and the way the city reproduces

2691
02:04:56,460 --> 02:04:59,699
itself is the outcome of a decade-long

2692
02:04:59,699 --> 02:05:02,159
battle of representation which was led

2693
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:04,800
by dominant Financial Elites politicians

2694
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:08,460
not often uh not seldomly connected to

2695
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:10,800
all boys networks that have been

2696
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:13,020
projecting the world city status of

2697
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:15,420
London and this has become some kind of

2698
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:17,659
a hegemonic

2699
02:05:17,659 --> 02:05:20,940
unquestioned uh neoliberal growth

2700
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:23,520
strategy okay it has been part of that

2701
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:26,520
neoliberal strategy since uh the 80s and

2702
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:28,980
the kind of ideas that what is good for

2703
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:31,619
the financial industry is good for the

2704
02:05:31,619 --> 02:05:33,179
city what's good for the city is good

2705
02:05:33,179 --> 02:05:34,920
for London not good for London it's good

2706
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:37,199
for the southeast of England

2707
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:38,880
what is good for the Saudis is good for

2708
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:42,060
the UK and uh dear Europeans with good

2709
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:44,940
what is good for the UK is also good for

2710
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:48,300
Europe so please deregulate Finance

2711
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:52,139
so it's a rhetorical strategy she calls

2712
02:05:52,139 --> 02:05:56,280
uh the passport Toto where the park is

2713
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,679
there to represent the whole so it's the

2714
02:05:58,679 --> 02:06:00,780
interests of the city of London which

2715
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:03,239
are projected to be the interests of the

2716
02:06:03,239 --> 02:06:06,900
UK citizen and again as brexit has shown

2717
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:10,560
this has been quite uh radically uh

2718
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,080
rejected again

2719
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,040
um

2720
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:18,020
whether legitimately or not

2721
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:20,760
um so yeah there's this neoliberal

2722
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:22,619
growth strategy and it also was

2723
02:06:22,619 --> 02:06:24,900
connected to a legitimate legitimized

2724
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:27,239
certain material decisions in the sense

2725
02:06:27,239 --> 02:06:28,020
that

2726
02:06:28,020 --> 02:06:30,960
if you look at this course is about does

2727
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:34,440
hydro need a new uh Runway because of

2728
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:38,340
capacity issues yes London cannot uh

2729
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:40,739
keep up with its Global City status or

2730
02:06:40,739 --> 02:06:42,840
it cannot grow it its connection to new

2731
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:45,599
Emerging Markets if it doesn't have an

2732
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:48,980
extra Runway so please neighbors

2733
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:51,800
go away or

2734
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:54,900
needle your ears

2735
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:57,239
um but we absolutely need this and

2736
02:06:57,239 --> 02:06:59,400
Global City discourse is there to

2737
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:01,679
justify that but also when you look at

2738
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:03,719
the Restriction of the UK economy and

2739
02:07:03,719 --> 02:07:07,380
70s and 80s I mean closing the mines etc

2740
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:10,139
etc and this has produced very uneven

2741
02:07:10,139 --> 02:07:12,480
outcomes in the UK a lot of cities in

2742
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,280
the north and hope mining areas

2743
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:17,580
industrial areas saw a decline and at

2744
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:19,020
that point what would have been

2745
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:22,440
interesting is low interest rates or

2746
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:24,480
that could boost investment to

2747
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:26,820
restructure these peripheral economies

2748
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:29,580
that didn't happen at that point there

2749
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:31,619
was an inflation there was high interest

2750
02:07:31,619 --> 02:07:33,540
rates which made

2751
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:36,920
but simply money very expensive

2752
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:39,840
and which made that it was very hard to

2753
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,699
seek investment in these areas and

2754
02:07:41,699 --> 02:07:43,199
obviously this was in the interest of

2755
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:45,900
the southeast which generated an influx

2756
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:48,780
into Financial Services Etc which then

2757
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:52,739
further grew a global City London so

2758
02:07:52,739 --> 02:07:55,080
it's a particular political agenda that

2759
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:58,139
is behind there that has produced there

2760
02:07:58,139 --> 02:08:01,500
another final point that we us as

2761
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:04,440
academics or academics to be are not

2762
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:07,739
neutral bystanders and her claim is that

2763
02:08:07,739 --> 02:08:09,060
especially when you start looking at

2764
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:11,400
these world city rankings

2765
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:15,000
um that Gog is claimed to produce this

2766
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,520
is part of the problem it's kind of

2767
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:19,860
fueling the self-fulfilling prophecy is

2768
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:23,460
giving people in the city of London

2769
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:25,560
the instruments and the exhibits to say

2770
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:28,860
look uh we're still the leading City but

2771
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:31,860
Dubai is closing please come on we need

2772
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:34,500
further investment uh in the city or we

2773
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,000
need the regulation or something like

2774
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,679
that

2775
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:39,599
um so that's kind of for also attention

2776
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:41,940
critique and sense that yes

2777
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:44,340
um world cities research is performative

2778
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:46,739
in that sense

2779
02:08:46,739 --> 02:08:49,860
so yeah uh just a few uh slides there

2780
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:53,040
and I'll return to that I mean the

2781
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:55,679
pictures that we have of representations

2782
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:58,139
that we have of London

2783
02:08:58,139 --> 02:09:00,960
um are the Blitzen Glam quite often and

2784
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:04,500
it's typically the city but then how

2785
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:06,840
cities kept the city of Lomas kept

2786
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:08,460
working or the wise much important area

2787
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:10,920
remains often undiscussed but that's

2788
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:12,900
something that we'll talk about next

2789
02:09:12,900 --> 02:09:14,219
week

2790
02:09:14,219 --> 02:09:15,000
um

2791
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,699
yeah and this is kind of uh Battle of

2792
02:09:17,699 --> 02:09:19,800
representation is ongoing this is a bit

2793
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:23,159
of a dated figure it's still with uh uh

2794
02:09:23,159 --> 02:09:25,440
with Theresa May there who I was going

2795
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:28,380
for a global Britain agenda uh and again

2796
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:30,540
you see that yeah

2797
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:31,380
um

2798
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:34,500
uh this kind of City Elite is trying to

2799
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:37,139
push it in the the whole campaign in a

2800
02:09:37,139 --> 02:09:41,219
certain way uh threatening to leave

2801
02:09:41,219 --> 02:09:43,739
um rapidly in the city of London which

2802
02:09:43,739 --> 02:09:45,480
would then impact you could say the

2803
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:49,080
global City status of of that City okay

2804
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:50,940
so it's kind of still the same

2805
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:54,599
repertoire that is being used uh at

2806
02:09:54,599 --> 02:09:57,659
times when when brexit was was still uh

2807
02:09:57,659 --> 02:09:59,820
unfinished business

2808
02:09:59,820 --> 02:10:01,800
it's probably not still not unfinished

2809
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:05,880
business but voila now I think uh and

2810
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:07,400
then I really almost had to close

2811
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:09,540
performativity is a very important

2812
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:11,219
criticism that's something that we

2813
02:10:11,219 --> 02:10:12,960
should be very reflexive about it

2814
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,000
basically means

2815
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,699
the insights that you produce kind of

2816
02:10:17,699 --> 02:10:19,260
figures that you produce the maps that

2817
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:21,239
you produce to what extent do they shape

2818
02:10:21,239 --> 02:10:24,119
and impact reality to an extent are they

2819
02:10:24,119 --> 02:10:26,340
picked up what is the responsibility of

2820
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:30,300
a researcher to keep ownership over his

2821
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:33,300
or her results

2822
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:35,580
do we have an impact of that and it's

2823
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:37,080
something that that is also very

2824
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:38,940
important to reflect on in relation to

2825
02:10:38,940 --> 02:10:41,340
world cities and Global cities

2826
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:44,040
and there I think my personal stance is

2827
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:47,040
that we should probably not exaggerate

2828
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:49,739
the influence of world and Global cities

2829
02:10:49,739 --> 02:10:52,139
research in the sense that it's only

2830
02:10:52,139 --> 02:10:56,099
part of a much wider phenomenon of of

2831
02:10:56,099 --> 02:10:59,340
City rankings etc etc and actually when

2832
02:10:59,340 --> 02:11:01,199
you start looking at it it's often the

2833
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:03,719
ABS firms themselves that come up with

2834
02:11:03,719 --> 02:11:06,000
all kinds of rankings another much more

2835
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,239
picked up in popular debates by

2836
02:11:09,239 --> 02:11:12,599
politicians that want to gain uh

2837
02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:16,139
a world in global City status rather

2838
02:11:16,139 --> 02:11:19,980
than referring to go in and of itself I

2839
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:21,420
mean it would be a pleasure to actually

2840
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:23,580
know that people read academic papers

2841
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:26,159
but I think it's actually quite quite

2842
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:28,199
limited so yes we need to be reflexive

2843
02:11:28,199 --> 02:11:30,239
about that but at the same time it could

2844
02:11:30,239 --> 02:11:32,580
maybe a little bit overblown and

2845
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:35,219
rankings are produced uh probably by

2846
02:11:35,219 --> 02:11:37,820
other facts

2847
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:41,580
um I'm sorry to run through this another

2848
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:42,870
point is

2849
02:11:42,870 --> 02:11:43,380
[Music]

2850
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:44,460
um

2851
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:48,540
and a criticism a criticism that deals

2852
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:50,940
with uh to what extent

2853
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:52,980
uh world and Global cities takes into

2854
02:11:52,980 --> 02:11:56,040
account you could say political economy

2855
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:59,639
um processes or the politics of global

2856
02:11:59,639 --> 02:12:01,440
City formation and I think that connects

2857
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:03,599
uh to the work of

2858
02:12:03,599 --> 02:12:06,060
um of Doreen Massey

2859
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:08,340
um and it's a kind of an agenda that was

2860
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:10,080
pushed by new Brenner especially at the

2861
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:12,360
high at the end of the 1990s

2862
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:14,520
and he says well it's not just economic

2863
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,260
geographies it's not just agglomerations

2864
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:19,320
cluster etc etc uh what we need to

2865
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:21,300
account for is the restructuring of the

2866
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:22,280
economy

2867
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:25,860
and what he says a rescaling of the

2868
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:27,300
nation state

2869
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:30,360
so the way uh capitalism is being

2870
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:33,360
governed is not exclusively at the

2871
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:35,099
national scale but something is

2872
02:12:35,099 --> 02:12:36,540
happening with that at the same time

2873
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:38,760
it's becoming supranational so you get

2874
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:40,320
all kinds of international organizations

2875
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:43,980
IMF oecd etc etc in Europe we have

2876
02:12:43,980 --> 02:12:45,560
European Union that starts to

2877
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:49,619
increasingly govern uh the economy and

2878
02:12:49,619 --> 02:12:51,260
at the same time there's a kind of

2879
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:54,659
devolution growth and the importance of

2880
02:12:54,659 --> 02:12:57,480
regions of cities as governance layers

2881
02:12:57,480 --> 02:12:59,940
and some kind of kind of a hollowing out

2882
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:02,880
of the national level so in the words of

2883
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:04,500
of you know Brenner it talks about

2884
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:06,960
globalization as the undoing of the

2885
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:09,480
state whether as the re-specialization

2886
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:12,000
or re-territorialization of the state

2887
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,460
where it attaches itself to new spatial

2888
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:16,739
layers and it calls these new state

2889
02:13:16,739 --> 02:13:19,739
spaces uh to which you have new kinds of

2890
02:13:19,739 --> 02:13:22,800
all kinds of new state projects growth

2891
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,900
projects so

2892
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:27,060
to summarize that seems a bit complex

2893
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:30,179
but there's a shift in in how National

2894
02:13:30,179 --> 02:13:32,940
economies are being managed in terms of

2895
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:35,219
spatial scales it's also happening in a

2896
02:13:35,219 --> 02:13:37,079
much more entrepreneurial way and I'll

2897
02:13:37,079 --> 02:13:40,440
say more that about that next week

2898
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:42,540
but the point is that this these are

2899
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:45,420
politically negotiated processes

2900
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:47,579
and you can have a look at at this

2901
02:13:47,579 --> 02:13:49,619
overview slide uh to the kind of

2902
02:13:49,619 --> 02:13:52,020
detailed uh process that are going on

2903
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:55,020
there but just to give one example they

2904
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:57,840
also kind of gave last week Brussels is

2905
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,360
kind of in this

2906
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:01,920
straight jacket of the Brussels Capital

2907
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:04,800
Region whereas it doesn't

2908
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:05,579
um

2909
02:14:05,579 --> 02:14:08,639
refer to the spatial scale of the actual

2910
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:10,800
metropolitan area or the economic weight

2911
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:11,880
of

2912
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:13,679
of the city

2913
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:15,960
whereas in other context you see the

2914
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:18,000
formation of

2915
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,340
um of the larger metropolitan areas as

2916
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:23,579
governance structures where Global City

2917
02:14:23,579 --> 02:14:25,860
from the foot is now trying to put a

2918
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:27,500
high in life

2919
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:31,639
it's a kind of more Global City region

2920
02:14:31,639 --> 02:14:34,139
organization which has its own

2921
02:14:34,139 --> 02:14:36,780
governance structure etc etc so there is

2922
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:40,619
easier to appreciated than that emerges

2923
02:14:40,619 --> 02:14:42,900
when you compare that to Brussels so

2924
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:45,420
it's it's a rescaling process and you

2925
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:48,179
see that in a lot of European contexts

2926
02:14:48,179 --> 02:14:51,719
not seldomly also kind of pushed for by

2927
02:14:51,719 --> 02:14:54,060
the European Union who likes to see

2928
02:14:54,060 --> 02:14:57,480
the Europe of regions it's kind of this

2929
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:00,540
idea that you need larger entities

2930
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:01,260
um

2931
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:05,520
city regions or regions to to kind of uh

2932
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,159
take control over upscale economic

2933
02:15:08,159 --> 02:15:09,599
processes

2934
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:12,540
so yeah a sensitivity to how the states

2935
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:15,060
spatially reorganized itself to an

2936
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:17,460
extent there's new governance layers to

2937
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:19,500
manage also these economic processes

2938
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:21,900
that was kind of also added to the

2939
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:24,360
debate and then finally very final

2940
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:27,840
slides is and it's kind of a critique or

2941
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:29,159
a criticism

2942
02:15:29,159 --> 02:15:30,719
buy

2943
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:32,760
um where people working in the realm of

2944
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:34,820
financialization

2945
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:38,040
I'll say much more about that if you

2946
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:39,060
take the economic and financial

2947
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:40,980
geography course it's

2948
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:43,679
it's all about financialization but just

2949
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:45,780
the point of the fact that

2950
02:15:45,780 --> 02:15:46,880
um

2951
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:50,520
criticism deals with what it is that is

2952
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:53,579
going on in world cities so it doesn't

2953
02:15:53,579 --> 02:15:57,420
really uh criticize the relevance of

2954
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:00,300
command and control practices in world

2955
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:02,219
and Global cities but it says that

2956
02:16:02,219 --> 02:16:04,320
perhaps the nature of these activities

2957
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:07,199
has transformed over the past 20 or 30

2958
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:09,060
years

2959
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:12,540
so financialization what does it mean it

2960
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:15,960
means that an increasing part of uh

2961
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:19,199
economic processes or value-based

2962
02:16:19,199 --> 02:16:21,360
processes or profits generating process

2963
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,099
not occurring you could say in

2964
02:16:23,099 --> 02:16:24,900
productive activities but is somehow

2965
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:27,119
connected to financial circuits so

2966
02:16:27,119 --> 02:16:30,659
financial investments is by owning

2967
02:16:30,659 --> 02:16:32,519
Financial assets rather than actually

2968
02:16:32,519 --> 02:16:36,120
producing something uh that uh that

2969
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:38,459
people get rich and it also explains a

2970
02:16:38,459 --> 02:16:41,280
runaway inequalities between those who

2971
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:44,218
have large uh huge amounts of wealth and

2972
02:16:44,218 --> 02:16:47,879
others who who rely on their labor but

2973
02:16:47,879 --> 02:16:49,558
we'll say something about that next week

2974
02:16:49,558 --> 02:16:52,620
so financialization also means that

2975
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:54,599
there's a lot of pressure on

2976
02:16:54,599 --> 02:16:56,099
corporations

2977
02:16:56,099 --> 02:16:59,519
two generate returns for financial

2978
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:01,799
investors so it's not just about

2979
02:17:01,799 --> 02:17:04,138
competing with other capitalists too to

2980
02:17:04,138 --> 02:17:06,718
be the most efficient car producer of

2981
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:09,780
cookie manufacturers it's also to do so

2982
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:12,359
to generate as much shareholder value

2983
02:17:12,359 --> 02:17:14,519
compared to your to your competitors

2984
02:17:14,519 --> 02:17:17,519
it's one I mean this kind of called

2985
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:19,260
corporate financialization it's the

2986
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:21,478
restructuring of Corporations so that

2987
02:17:21,478 --> 02:17:23,160
the shareholder value is actually being

2988
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:24,660
created

2989
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:25,978
so

2990
02:17:25,978 --> 02:17:29,218
perhaps world cities are still about

2991
02:17:29,218 --> 02:17:33,058
seamless service for globalization so

2992
02:17:33,058 --> 02:17:34,558
the management of Global Production

2993
02:17:34,558 --> 02:17:37,379
processes networks but this other side

2994
02:17:37,379 --> 02:17:39,359
financial markets perhaps needs to be

2995
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:42,000
taken much more seriously and these abs

2996
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,099
firms may be more and borrowed and

2997
02:17:44,099 --> 02:17:47,218
Loyals and process of financialization

2998
02:17:47,218 --> 02:17:51,478
rather than productivist logics

2999
02:17:51,478 --> 02:17:52,620
um

3000
02:17:52,620 --> 02:17:55,740
so yeah just uh wait

3001
02:17:55,740 --> 02:17:58,439
um so yeah and I think

3002
02:17:58,439 --> 02:18:00,478
um this is what I say here World Series

3003
02:18:00,478 --> 02:18:02,760
may become like obligatory passage

3004
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:05,099
points for other reasons than the ones

3005
02:18:05,099 --> 02:18:07,500
that have been assumed uh already and

3006
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:10,138
that's why uh in one paper we talk about

3007
02:18:10,138 --> 02:18:13,320
an augmented world city uh hypothesis

3008
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:16,340
it's not just about generating value

3009
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:19,080
from productive activities but it's also

3010
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:21,780
about extracting value to rent

3011
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:24,420
extraction practices from those global

3012
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:27,058
production networks and you can see that

3013
02:18:27,058 --> 02:18:28,920
for instance when when you see how

3014
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:31,920
corporations attract funding uh you need

3015
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:36,179
a whole uh amalgamation of of connected

3016
02:18:36,179 --> 02:18:39,718
ABS firms to issue in this case a Euro

3017
02:18:39,718 --> 02:18:42,299
law which is some kind of an offshore uh

3018
02:18:42,299 --> 02:18:46,920
investment instrument and this is a um a

3019
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:49,398
firm a real estate Corporation

3020
02:18:49,398 --> 02:18:52,260
Northern Germany and it's kind of face

3021
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:56,398
all these people to issue debt on a

3022
02:18:56,398 --> 02:18:58,500
global scale so to finance Its Real

3023
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:01,920
Estate projects in Germany so world

3024
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:04,859
cities are mobilized to attract funding

3025
02:19:04,859 --> 02:19:07,679
and to optimize that in a particular way

3026
02:19:07,679 --> 02:19:10,019
the same thing happens when you look at

3027
02:19:10,019 --> 02:19:12,420
the other side of the equation when

3028
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:15,000
value has been produced the point is

3029
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,620
that you

3030
02:19:16,620 --> 02:19:19,740
limit the taxes that you have to pay on

3031
02:19:19,740 --> 02:19:23,120
your Surplus value otherwise

3032
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:25,260
shareholders won't be pleased and you're

3033
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:27,540
competing with other firms to pay as

3034
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:30,179
much shareholder value as possible and

3035
02:19:30,179 --> 02:19:32,700
this is a classic example by Google who

3036
02:19:32,700 --> 02:19:36,120
is using a double dutch Irish sandwich

3037
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:38,459
to um

3038
02:19:38,459 --> 02:19:40,500
yeah to make sure that it's it's

3039
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:43,978
minimizes its its uh its its taxes right

3040
02:19:43,978 --> 02:19:44,820
so

3041
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:46,859
it puts I mean I studied the details and

3042
02:19:46,859 --> 02:19:48,599
I actually don't know them by heart but

3043
02:19:48,599 --> 02:19:51,479
places some intellectual property in

3044
02:19:51,479 --> 02:19:53,939
Ireland and that fermented through the

3045
02:19:53,939 --> 02:19:56,040
Netherlands goes back to Ireland and

3046
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:58,979
then it passes through the Caribbean

3047
02:19:58,979 --> 02:20:01,439
um uh to optimize that circuit and this

3048
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:03,020
is also something that firms like

3049
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:06,120
Deloitte and law firms are also engaged

3050
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:09,120
so it's the optimization of these kind

3051
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:11,399
of financial structures uh amidst

3052
02:20:11,399 --> 02:20:13,500
financialization is also a very

3053
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:16,740
important function of world cities so in

3054
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:17,880
the end

3055
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:20,399
I think to summarize the picture it's

3056
02:20:20,399 --> 02:20:21,960
about

3057
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:24,180
um you could say representation you

3058
02:20:24,180 --> 02:20:25,740
could think about

3059
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:30,140
um world cities as kind of Mount Everest

3060
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:33,479
agglomerations of wealth that is being

3061
02:20:33,479 --> 02:20:35,760
generated and then will then spill over

3062
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:38,340
across the territory but you can also

3063
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:41,100
think about uh how's it called in

3064
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:44,520
English the Marian deaths 11 kilometers

3065
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:48,359
deep uh where a value that is being

3066
02:20:48,359 --> 02:20:51,180
produced elsewhere is being extracted to

3067
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:56,399
and is basically uh putting a drain on

3068
02:20:56,399 --> 02:20:59,160
the global economy and if you look at

3069
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:00,600
what happened during the financial

3070
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,220
crisis

3071
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:04,740
each of the financial sector created a

3072
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:07,080
lot of surplus if you will generate a

3073
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:09,780
lot of profits then came the crisis and

3074
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:12,899
it I mean I think in Europe it was the

3075
02:21:12,899 --> 02:21:15,720
figure of 700 billion uh that the

3076
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:17,460
financial sector was kind of bailed out

3077
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:19,859
and it was even more in the U.S

3078
02:21:19,859 --> 02:21:23,939
it's huge figures of saving these kind

3079
02:21:23,939 --> 02:21:26,100
of activities where in general they're

3080
02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:28,380
actually putting a next drain on the

3081
02:21:28,380 --> 02:21:29,880
global economy

3082
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:32,340
so we really have to think about world

3083
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:34,859
cities in a critical way

3084
02:21:34,859 --> 02:21:36,960
what do they contribute or what are the

3085
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:38,340
actors in world cities what do they

3086
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:40,560
contribute and what what kind of things

3087
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,479
effects are or more

3088
02:21:42,479 --> 02:21:45,180
problematic I'm very sorry to take a

3089
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:47,280
little bit more of your time but that

3090
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:49,800
was kind of four ways of being critical

3091
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:53,280
about world and Global cities

3092
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,979
there's no time for Q a now but next

3093
02:21:55,979 --> 02:21:58,560
week we'll continue and maybe we can

3094
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:01,200
start with uh with some questions next

3095
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:03,540
week week if you would have them

3096
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:07,380
and uh we'll talk with the flip side of

3097
02:22:07,380 --> 02:22:08,580
the coin

3098
02:22:08,580 --> 02:22:10,020
about the flip side of the Chrome is

3099
02:22:10,020 --> 02:22:12,180
just polarization so what does it mean

3100
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:14,580
world and Global City formation for

3101
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:16,620
these very places

3102
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:19,040
and these are the two texts that you're

3103
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:23,060
warmly invited to read

3104
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:25,020
thank you

3105
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:28,179
