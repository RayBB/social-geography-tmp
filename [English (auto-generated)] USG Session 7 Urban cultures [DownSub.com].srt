1
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,400
I'll start recording immediately because

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,919
I forgot to start recording for the

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,599
lecture of Claire at least for part of

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,880
it let me see here

5
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,280
all right can everyone hear me

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,879
yeah I see shaking ass that's good

7
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,740
I now also open to chats I finally found

8
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,439
out how to deal with the chat while

9
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,380
being in a formal uh presenting mode

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,380
um I think it's about time to start

11
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,320
um welcome to the second lecture for

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,540
um Urban social geography where I'll be

13
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,960
spend in the next two hours uh let's see

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,200
if yeah how how much time we need

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
um for election Urban cultures so um as

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,420
you remember in the last session I

17
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,100
largely gave a historical overview of

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,200
what I consider to be essential let's

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
say core coordinates of thinking about

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,380
culture in urban geography and more

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,420
widely some other let's say related

22
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,880
disciplines starting with a brief

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,979
discussion well but it's a relatively

24
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,960
specific discussion on Frederick Jameson

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,659
and his notion of post-modernism moving

26
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,119
to the shift of moving to let's say the

27
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,640
1980s early 1990s debate on um

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,840
post-modern urbanism and the LA School

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,719
of urbanism and then shifting to a to a

30
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,758
wider or but also related debate on the

31
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,860
symbolic economy those were the key

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,200
coordinates that I tried to to get

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,620
across one of the questions well you

34
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,420
can't see the slides can can everyone

35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,420
see the slides oh that's odd thank you

36
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,400
for asking the question because I'm

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,580
actually screen sharing now

38
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,640
um let me just see I'll just

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,220
stop share you should be able to see the

40
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,840
slides

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,700
another sec

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,700
um

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,819
share screen

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,080
I'll do it like this done simply this

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,280
just a sec

46
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,180
okay you now see my screen

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,700
except that I can't see you now just a

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,959
sec

49
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,379
this is odds uh one here we are

50
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,700
yeah never see the slides now

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,860
I see you one yes thank you so I hope

52
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,280
that's okay perfect okay yes okay thanks

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
a lot yeah feel free to unmute sometimes

54
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,840
that's easier than uh than working with

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,120
uh sign language

56
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,980
um the only thing is I can't see you now

57
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,019
let me see

58
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,959
um where is that

59
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,000
just want to say ah here we are okay now

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,560
I see you and hopefully you see me and

61
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,599
we see the slides you did hear what I

62
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,459
was saying right so okay let's let's

63
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,560
keep it from there

64
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,959
um so what I try to get across last week

65
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,819
is what I just discussed I tried to give

66
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,379
an historical overview of some of the

67
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,879
core elements that I thought I think

68
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,680
were are important thinking about Urban

69
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,080
culture over the last 30 40 years

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,180
actually oh and some people are in the

71
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,260
waiting room

72
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,580
my life is so so easy let me see

73
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,120
[Music]

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,700
before you start working here where are

75
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,340
we no no no no

76
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,319
um I'll stop sharing again that will

77
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,000
admit all again

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,440
but at some point it becomes a bit

79
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,120
tricky then people just have to wait for

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,280
the last the next uh

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,739
the next pause is otherwise it becomes

82
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,720
difficult because with the session of

83
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,280
clear I could actually manage this but

84
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,079
since I don't have an assistant next to

85
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,660
me this is uh what we'll work with Okay

86
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,820
next round we'll we'll go for another

87
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,840
run here we go uh

88
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,360
chat

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,740
and start

90
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,060
and now I just need to slip this

91
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,699
do we disadvantage that I don't see you

92
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,900
anymore ah here we are there we are

93
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,759
okay getting there

94
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,180
so for the third time uh I tried to give

95
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,560
an historical overview one of the

96
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,180
questions I received last week is okay

97
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,100
are we going to learn more about actual

98
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,680
cultures so cultural expressions stuff

99
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,560
that interests interests us as 20 20

100
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,300
year olds 20 year olds that's what I

101
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,460
remember so the question to the answer

102
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,740
to that question is yes uh in the

103
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,620
session today I will focus a bit more in

104
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,840
detail on specific well I I will always

105
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,620
focus on research on Urban culture but

106
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,540
look at zooming in more specifically on

107
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,280
Research that looks at actual cultural

108
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,259
expressions but always from the

109
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,180
perspective as to how this has been done

110
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,580
in urban studies there are many other

111
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,139
disciplines of course that focus on

112
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,360
culture or cultural expressions coming

113
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,220
from the humanities in particular

114
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,500
but I will largely zoom in on how this

115
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,419
has been approached within within Urban

116
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,039
studies

117
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,699
um

118
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,979
that will hopefully become clear or

119
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,780
clearer in a minute

120
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,120
before doing so I have I want to broaden

121
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,860
the debate a bit beyond urban geography

122
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,960
per se and and I show some of the slides

123
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,340
and discuss some of the slides that I

124
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,340
also already mentioned uh last uh last

125
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,900
week

126
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,300
because if you look at the way urban

127
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,759
geography has has undergone its own

128
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,220
cultural turn as I'm as I hinted at last

129
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,560
week what we saw happening in in

130
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,240
parallel is that many other disciplines

131
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,740
within the social science the humanities

132
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,840
have also undergone a kind of spatial

133
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,820
turn so we've seen a kind of meeting

134
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,280
halfway a kind of rakash more between

135
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,139
geography becoming a more cultural

136
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,120
discipline but other disciplines also

137
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,759
becoming more cultural becoming more

138
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,840
geographical becoming more spatial

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,400
um so this cultural this spatial turn

140
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,380
had a number of reasons as I already

141
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,660
mentioned I think last week one of them

142
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,240
being a post 1989 obsession with

143
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,220
globalization so the moment you start

144
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,960
thinking seriously about globalization

145
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,880
you quasi-automatically start thinking

146
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,280
about spatial issues about geographical

147
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,380
issues because what if it's here but

148
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,120
also somewhere else you start thinking

149
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,500
about Connections

150
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,300
the other one being a kind of critique

151
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,160
of modernity which had really shaped I

152
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,479
think most of the social science and

153
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,120
Humanities debates up until the 1970s

154
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,419
which primarily sort of uh paid

155
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,160
attention to temporal issues to time

156
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,539
because that's the very logic of

157
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,840
thinking in terms of modernity so what

158
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,539
we've seen over the years since the late

159
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,759
1970s roughly speaking is we see this

160
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,100
kind of de-emphasizing us of temporal

161
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,500
issues and emphasizing

162
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,620
uh of of spatial issues and this is

163
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,120
where the let's see the spatial turn

164
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,880
comes in so this in turn and this is

165
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,620
what I want to briefly focus on for the

166
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,080
opening of this today's session led to

167
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
an increased interaction between urban

168
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,560
geography Urban anthropology and

169
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,840
cultural studies many other disciplines

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,400
also but for me those are some of the

171
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,620
core disciplines that really

172
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,919
um shaped I think the future of uh of us

173
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,020
the the the the research on Urban

174
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,580
culture at Large

175
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,199
now there are

176
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,960
a number of core teams in urban

177
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,120
anthropology and and or cultural studies

178
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
that have shaped the late 20th century

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,639
early 21st century trajectory of what I

180
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,419
consider to be let's say

181
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,120
interdisciplinary Urban studies I'm not

182
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,740
going to give a review here of urban

183
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,660
anthropology or cultural studies they're

184
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,300
both fascinating disciplines I learned a

185
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,699
lot from both disciplines

186
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,020
um I mean I was trained in cultural

187
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,639
studies myself before becoming a

188
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,560
geographer you could say

189
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,960
um but there are two let's say teams

190
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,599
that I want to briefly flag here which I

191
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,440
think

192
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,620
um I have a much longer history in in in

193
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,900
anthropology and cultural studies but

194
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,000
have which have really been picked up in

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,979
in into this finale Urban studies and

196
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,900
shaped this debate up to the present day

197
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,200
the first debate uh being around what I

198
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,059
label here is informality

199
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,740
it's the kind of debate that that

200
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,620
emerged in anthropology and and

201
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,200
development studies largely focusing on

202
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,180
informal economy labor markets

203
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,640
precarious work migration issues of

204
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,100
workers legality and illegality

205
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,959
distinction but also the regulation so

206
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,480
the political governance of uh of

207
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,580
informality I'll give a few examples in

208
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,360
a minute

209
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,339
the second core team that I think is

210
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,680
important to to keep in mind as a kind

211
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,480
of understanding of the history of

212
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,880
research on Urban culture is research on

213
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,820
everyday life that's a term that is you

214
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,380
don't see the term used that much

215
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,600
anymore I would say in the last 10 years

216
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,760
or so you still see it a lot but then

217
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,279
less so as a theoretical concept but it

218
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,899
was it was a term that was pretty much

219
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,600
dominant almost in dominance in the

220
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,620
1980s 1990s 2000s largely used as a kind

221
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,480
of shorthand or a kind of buzzword for

222
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,100
referring to issues around agency

223
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,920
community community building also

224
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,260
resistance issues as well as consumption

225
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,000
and identity questions and related

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,700
representational questions which then in

227
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,740
turn uh had an often a lot to do with

228
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,899
how things were represented in in media

229
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,700
so everyday life

230
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,560
refers to many things just as

231
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,240
informality refers to many things but if

232
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
you would have to give a kind of

233
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,660
nutshell summary this slide pretty much

234
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,560
covers it I think

235
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,940
now briefly if you think about

236
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,300
informality within biology Urban

237
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,740
anthropology and development studies

238
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,200
it's a term that is last was less use in

239
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,100
in cultural studies it's a classic team

240
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,779
especially from the early 1970s onwards

241
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,420
the the core reference and perhaps uh

242
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,820
the the first person who coined the idea

243
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,399
of the informal economy that many others

244
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,660
of course who did research on the

245
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,820
informal economy without labeling it as

246
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,700
such was key to heart and one of the

247
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,140
classic articles or one of the first

248
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,720
articles there is this article from 1973

249
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,060
which is titled informal income

250
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,860
opportunities and urban employment in

251
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,140
Ghana now the article is actually case

252
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,680
study as such is less relevant than

253
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,720
um than the understanding as to what he

254
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,519
coined in this article how this is

255
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,220
shaped let's say subsequent debates so

256
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,320
heart primarily focused on a number of

257
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,620
things you focused on actual employment

258
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,899
so people making a living beyond

259
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,060
government jobs Beyond factories and

260
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,519
Beyond large-scale companies yeah I said

261
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,500
okay there's a whole world out there of

262
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,779
how people make a living especially in

263
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,579
Ghana but he then sort of extrapolated

264
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,980
this through Urban Africa at large say

265
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,660
okay there's a whole world out there of

266
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,839
work that we actually don't see we don't

267
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,640
capture it we don't matter we don't see

268
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,380
it because we don't have the vocabulary

269
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,899
to really pay attention to it

270
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,820
so that's that's the first observation

271
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,579
he makes there yeah that makes it uh he

272
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,779
bases this on a distinction between

273
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,820
informal and formally where he says well

274
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,459
all the vocabulary that we have is

275
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,019
largely catering to especially from

276
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,360
economics to capturing registering and

277
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,760
registering and measuring uh formal

278
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,519
labor so labor that actually shows up in

279
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,640
in GDP uh values Etc yeah labor that is

280
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,579
actually taxed and a lot of the labor

281
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,680
that we see in urban Africa you argued

282
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,720
is not taxed as such or we don't see it

283
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,220
for that reason

284
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,260
so he introduced the distinction

285
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,720
informal labor formal economy formal

286
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,079
employment and informal employment

287
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,820
he also then makes a distinction between

288
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,680
illegitimate and legitimate labor where

289
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,320
he said okay legitimate activity which

290
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,940
is not the same as informal and formal

291
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,700
he says okay we can have informal

292
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,459
activity according to him so economic

293
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,220
activity which is not measured as such

294
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,779
which is still legitimate which he then

295
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,820
argues those are activities that do

296
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,160
actually make a contribution to economic

297
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,040
growth but at a small scale so if you

298
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,720
let's say uh sell uh uh Foods on on a

299
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
local market but this is not this is not

300
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,440
captured you're not registered as an

301
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,480
official business this according to them

302
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,640
is legitimate in for a legitimate

303
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,920
informal activity which I think most of

304
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,019
us can actually agree with and then

305
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,360
there's illegitimate informal activity

306
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,399
where he says well that can refer to

307
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,260
criminal activities but also for example

308
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,260
to bagging or bribery or corruption

309
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,260
which he considers to be a illegitimate

310
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,240
so there's a kind of fourfold

311
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,519
Distinction which is uh which has really

312
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,019
shaped the thing to debate and you can

313
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,940
question and disagree with some of the

314
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,160
species of his arguments but the way he

315
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,560
structured this idea has uh has been

316
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,000
quite important

317
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
now I mentioned this here not because I

318
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,660
want to discuss with you Urban Africa or

319
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,019
1973 Keith Hart but because I think some

320
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,940
of the the let's see the landmark

321
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,740
studies that he and others have done in

322
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,320
the early 1970s have informed the

323
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,180
debates that followed elsewhere

324
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,100
informality is an interesting concept

325
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,839
because it's one of the few Concepts You

326
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,120
could argue that has really seen a

327
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,740
concept travel from the global styles to

328
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,320
the global North so where most of us are

329
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,300
very well aware of critiques to what

330
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,860
let's say Urban studies saying well it's

331
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,480
actually eurocentric or at least Western

332
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,700
Centric informality is one of those

333
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,459
Concepts which you could say started in

334
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,260
the global South and actually has been

335
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,820
picked up increasingly in order to

336
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,680
understand also practices within the

337
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,959
global North to such an extent I would

338
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,579
argue that as one of the few Concepts

339
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,380
which really transcends this kind of

340
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,540
global style Global nor divides and

341
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,100
really sort of contributes to thinking

342
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,560
in terms of a global Urban studies so if

343
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,240
you look at work for example of of

344
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,880
ananya Roy or Jennifer Roberson they've

345
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,980
picked up on the on the informality

346
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,260
topic as a way of also thinking about

347
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,000
Urban studies in more Global terms

348
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,560
without being being let's say

349
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,200
eurocentric or Western Centric

350
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,000
um there are all kinds of related terms

351
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
and they all have to do let's say this

352
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,279
disciplinary specifics that are pretty

353
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,079
much try to cover the same field but I

354
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,880
won't discuss here such as unregistered

355
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,639
economy Black Market the non-observed

356
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,920
economy Undeclared work or the Shadow or

357
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,680
hidden economy and for those that say

358
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,060
more trained and feminist Theory it's

359
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,800
quite obvious let's say that the

360
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,959
distinction between informal and formal

361
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,600
but actually also maps on to the

362
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,040
distinction between public and private

363
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,100
with public with public activities often

364
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,779
being seen as part of the former economy

365
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,519
but let's say private activities such as

366
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,920
care work being seen as the informal

367
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,260
economy often also not measured and thus

368
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,260
supposedly not worthy of attention yeah

369
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,019
and of course this is as overlapped and

370
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,180
and been involved in rethinking the

371
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,980
terms of that debate to an important

372
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,639
extent also

373
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,320
so on Urban anthropology when thinking

374
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,180
about informality you get the research

375
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,279
on the opportunities but also precarious

376
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,139
created by unregulated economic

377
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,600
activities uh I will give some examples

378
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,279
later but it's quite obvious for example

379
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,199
if we fast forward let's say to research

380
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,240
on creative and cultural Industries and

381
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,100
research that is now being done on

382
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,980
precarious uh precarious uh artistic

383
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,620
labor for example it's it's it struggles

384
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,600
with a similar attention where to a

385
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,399
large extent artistic labor is also

386
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,500
unregulated which creates all kinds of

387
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,779
freedoms and opportunities but is at the

388
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:34,860
same time this let's say this

389
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,019
unregulated nature which makes it very

390
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,820
precarious because there's no way you

391
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,040
can actually support or let's say where

392
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
a state or a welfare state of other

393
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,300
mechanisms can actually structure the

394
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,639
kind of economic activities

395
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,920
Urban anthropology historically speaking

396
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,420
has also seen a strong interest in the

397
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,600
gender dimensions of informal works I've

398
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,820
already hinted at this partially in the

399
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,220
home situation partially mostly females

400
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,279
being women working on markets Etc so

401
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,800
all kinds of uh gendered in exclusions

402
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,839
that are part of this discussion and

403
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,940
again these have shaped debates in the

404
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,639
in the decades that followed

405
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,199
also important things that Urban

406
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,779
anthropology we see informality being

407
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,100
linked strongly to transnational

408
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,560
Dimensions yeah so with the idea that

409
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,860
informal uh labor market in formal Urban

410
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,480
labor markets are often also highly

411
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,240
transnational labor markets on one level

412
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,279
with

413
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,660
diaspora connections people sending back

414
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,579
their their their earnings or part of

415
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,800
their earnings to their home country but

416
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,060
also with many migrants actually

417
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,459
occupying in former labor markets in in

418
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,500
country in cities across the world so

419
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,579
there's a kind of transnational

420
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,440
connection which urban anthropology

421
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,720
certainly was among the first uh to pay

422
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,240
uh to pay attention to oh which has seen

423
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,820
an increasing amount of research in in

424
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,800
urban and interdisciplinary Urban

425
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,839
studies

426
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,000
to use an example of the mandir was in

427
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Barcelona for example who often have an

428
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,620
African background uh and who have who

429
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,480
live in relatively precarious situations

430
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,400
well very precarious situation in Spain

431
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,980
being sort of legal illegal semi-legal

432
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,959
in different different kinds of statuses

433
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,959
and trying to make a living uh in in

434
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,319
this case Barcelona

435
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,880
so that's a five minute summary of a 40

436
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,099
40-year debate in urban anthropology so

437
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,500
apologies for any sort of uh lack of

438
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,599
selfies but my discussion is relatively

439
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,700
instrumental here and that I want to get

440
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
across some of the key uh let's say

441
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,039
conceptual elements uh conceptual

442
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,200
nuggets you could say that that should

443
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,000
also shape debate and interdisciplinary

444
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,059
Urban studies a second term that that

445
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,880
I'm sure you've come across before in in

446
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,679
your reading is everyday life

447
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,820
now but wasn't anthropology but

448
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,799
especially I think in cultural studies

449
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,900
this notion of everyday life really

450
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,299
shaped the debate and and and signifies

451
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,640
in many ways a concern with the lift

452
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,500
experiences and meanings constructed by

453
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,900
subjects in their own worlds

454
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,240
um partially emerging you could save in

455
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,059
in the 1970s as a chronic critique of

456
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,039
supposedly structuralist Marxist theory

457
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,260
paying more attention to agency so it's

458
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,380
part of that 1970s 1980s debate but then

459
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,840
also um

460
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,039
increasingly moving into a let's say

461
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,020
substantive Empirical research

462
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,940
where uh where research started paying

463
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,559
attention to the actual lift experiences

464
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,580
and the meanings of of people yeah so

465
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,380
people as active creative agents rather

466
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,780
than as passive consumers uh this is

467
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,280
kind of what the the broad

468
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,620
interdisciplinary sprawling debate of

469
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,360
everyday life uh signifies

470
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,900
now there are many

471
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,880
I think within different supplies that

472
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,559
have in one way or another try to engage

473
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,480
with everyday life with or without using

474
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,700
the concept one which I will only hint

475
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,400
at I think here but which might be

476
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,500
discussed in some more detail by those

477
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,720
that follow not I know what not everyone

478
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,820
does but depending on your program those

479
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,620
that follow Urban sociology of Ava

480
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,020
swimkidao there's a kind of tradition of

481
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,640
community studies and anthropology and

482
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,799
cultural studies which historically has

483
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,539
focused on participant observation and

484
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,160
extensive periods of field work to

485
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,780
really gain trust and insight knowledge

486
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,240
of everyday practices so basically an

487
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,919
anthropological stance you could say you

488
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,919
become part of a community and only

489
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,780
through this inside knowledge you will

490
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,880
actually understand the meanings and and

491
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,380
interpretations attached to certain

492
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,640
practices

493
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,679
it of course also has a history going

494
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,600
back to the Chicago school with research

495
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,179
on also ethnographic research on on

496
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,700
urban areas and various let's say Urban

497
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,799
topics such as gangs ethnic segregation

498
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,660
lifestyle delinquency

499
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,820
but there's also a rural connection

500
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,220
whereas especially within our sociology

501
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,620
let's say partially in parallel to the

502
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,000
Chicago school which was always more

503
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,520
urban in its orientation where some

504
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,380
classic Community studies especially in

505
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,080
the 1950s and 1960s

506
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,820
um sort of started applying you could

507
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,559
say rural concepts of classic Community

508
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,500
studies to Urban settings so look going

509
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,780
into a supposed community in an urban

510
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,640
setting and then focusing on let's say

511
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,460
family and kinship relations or

512
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,980
traditions and rituals yeah this kind of

513
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,720
community studies literature has been

514
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,600
quite heavily criticized over the years

515
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,820
largely for being too localists or for

516
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,320
assuming Community as relatively

517
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,360
homogeneous which was already

518
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,179
problematic you would say in a in a

519
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,100
rural setting but certainly you is

520
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,799
problematic in a much more dynamic

521
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,240
dynamic Urban setting so this idea that

522
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,120
communities actually share same values

523
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,640
was increasingly questioned but the

524
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,500
tradition there of let's say focusing on

525
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,440
everyday life of these communities uh

526
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,539
was already was established by this kind

527
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,539
of uh this kind of literature

528
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,000
excuse me uh there's somebody waiting on

529
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,039
their waiting room let's see because

530
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,020
every time when I have to well I might

531
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,980
be able to do it like this

532
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,039
nope where are we

533
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:02,760
participants here we are okay four more

534
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,020
because I can't do this all the time

535
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,760
because it's quite interrupting so but

536
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,100
I'll now I'll start again

537
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,039
okay you can still see me

538
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,220
perfect now we'll continue

539
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,660
um

540
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,179
so especially from the 1980s onwards I

541
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,280
think we've seen a Revival of the of the

542
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,440
community studies uh that moved beyond

543
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,880
the kind of nostalgic notion of

544
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,200
community and this is where sort of

545
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
again the everyday life uh Notions uh

546
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,400
um well returns in a way or becomes more

547
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,240
present in in in in theorizing uh urban

548
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,860
communities

549
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,900
some basic Trends and again I just

550
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,520
mentioned them here but I think they

551
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
basically still structure the debate up

552
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,260
to this day is that artists started

553
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,940
using conflict theoretical approaches

554
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,260
instead of cohesion theoretical

555
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,659
approaches so looking at

556
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,940
let's say interactions obviously social

557
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,760
interactions between uh actors between

558
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,340
people but also not sort of assuming

559
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,980
let's say cohesion theoretically but

560
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,419
assuming that's the conflict

561
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,179
theoretically you could say very bluntly

562
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,679
speaking you could say instead moving

563
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,360
from a dual Crimean perspective to a

564
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,400
Marxist perspective that's very

565
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,320
simplistic but basically that's is what

566
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,140
covers to a certain extent the debates

567
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,659
also focus on network ties local and

568
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,280
trans local I already mentioned this

569
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,900
with Urban anthropology

570
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,179
uh care and support and unequal and

571
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,820
changing our settings and because of the

572
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,520
let's say the interest in let's say

573
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,539
conflicts and how communities are

574
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,520
constructed not how they I say are

575
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,799
assumed to be there was increasing

576
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,059
interest to let's see the shifting

577
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,860
symbolic boundaries between communities

578
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,380
so the sort of the the making connection

579
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,260
but also making distinctions between uh

580
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,539
between communities and between groups

581
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,400
and that of course then opens up let's

582
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,260
say the base to not just communities as

583
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,620
let's say an aprily facts of social life

584
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,140
but more into debates around communities

585
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,299
of choice and elective belonging so they

586
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,700
can move into subcultures or lgbtqi

587
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,919
communities but also gated communities

588
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,419
for example in urban settings where

589
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,480
people choose to belong to a very

590
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,140
separate community

591
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,080
now the everyday is really a striking uh

592
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,000
coincidence let's say the career of this

593
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,440
concept because it's a truly

594
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,840
transdisciplinary concept perhaps even

595
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,299
more so than uh than the informal or

596
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,580
informality truly transdisciplinary

597
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,679
maybe with a strong Humanity background

598
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,900
but really connecting cultural Theory

599
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,640
with philosophy with Marxism with

600
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,860
ethnography with more structuralism with

601
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,600
sociology and with Aesthetics and that's

602
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,460
that's precisely what makes this concept

603
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,860
I think so interesting or so influential

604
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,799
for research on Urban cultures now you

605
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,120
have to be careful here because the

606
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,460
simple fact that a concept is used and

607
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,140
all these different let's say Traditions

608
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,059
or disciplines doesn't mean of course

609
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,400
that is used in the same way so if you

610
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,080
look for example that's and there's no

611
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,299
no time to discuss this here but if you

612
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,460
look for example that everyday life in

613
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,980
in let's say ethnography it's quite

614
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,299
different than everyday life and

615
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,700
Aesthetics and quite different than

616
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,200
everyday life let's say in more post

617
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,440
post-structural literary Theory yeah

618
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,120
um so you have to be quite careful there

619
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,400
but for every studies I would argue

620
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,679
there are a number of approaches which

621
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,360
have really let's say let's see Eternal

622
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,220
references in a way those those artists

623
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,900
that are continually continuously

624
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,539
referenced one is the unavoidable Humvee

625
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:22,500
Lafayette

626
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,980
everyone references hallway Lafayette

627
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,480
who sees the everyday as a side of

628
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,480
utopian possibility but in in line with

629
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,880
let's say it's Marx's credentials also

630
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,980
sees the everyday as colonized by the

631
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,860
commodity form so a commodification

632
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,500
logic also shaping the everyday that has

633
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,179
been of course Very differential thing

634
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,760
in in in our studies to a large extent

635
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,400
also because it it's pretty compatible

636
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,020
with the kind of critical political

637
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,240
economic Urban studies approach so

638
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,340
people can claim or can become more

639
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,320
interested in culture but don't actually

640
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,760
don't have to leave let's say the house

641
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,740
of political economy too far they can

642
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,140
stay pretty close to that kind of debate

643
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,760
but I would ask you to also pay

644
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,020
attention to other more let's say

645
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,059
perhaps empirically minded research that

646
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,220
was still very theoretical and I can I

647
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,440
will only mention two here which which

648
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,240
have been equally at least influential I

649
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,720
think in in urban studies one being uh

650
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,480
worked by Stuart Hall

651
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,840
um who is a massive towering figure I

652
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,400
think within cultural studies British

653
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,440
cultural studies at least

654
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
um who looks at let's say the everyday

655
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,860
life Elijah tour you could say

656
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,840
especially in this book here which is an

657
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,580
additive book and a compilation of let's

658
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,980
see classic uh papers of the British

659
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,100
cultural studies

660
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,500
Center at that point in time uh to the

661
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,200
looks at it to the subcultural lands and

662
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,000
the notion of subculture was coined by

663
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,179
British cultural studies and even though

664
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,799
subculture is also where we tend not to

665
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,559
use anymore many of the let's say

666
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,340
practices that we assumed to uh to shape

667
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,679
subcultures are with us today so we

668
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,240
might not name them subcultures anymore

669
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,640
we might talk about them it seems or

670
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,799
about the networks or something along

671
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,779
those lines but the idea that

672
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:10,020
subcultures are let's say every day but

673
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,520
also are also kind of symbolic

674
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,500
opposition to a dominant social order

675
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,240
this idea that they're in one way or

676
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,120
another resistance uh is is very

677
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,279
influential I think so if you look at

678
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,020
the literature on let's say subcultures

679
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,840
or let's say neural literature on on

680
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,880
protest movements or let's say clubbing

681
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,580
culture it's it's it still uses these

682
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,500
kinds of this kind of vocabulary

683
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,620
so that then directs attention allows

684
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,320
you to Urban practices of resistance but

685
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,240
also style of fashion of social

686
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,700
practices or the particular codes that

687
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,159
are used within within a community and

688
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,779
interacts attention I think also to a

689
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,100
particular let's say generational

690
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,100
category namely Urban Youth

691
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,380
um which I think was really has always

692
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,700
been a researched in a way but British

693
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,340
cultural studies tradition as as perhaps

694
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,380
directed most of his attention to let's

695
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,320
see this particular category uh of this

696
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,100
particular generational layer

697
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,700
typical however also for British

698
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,159
cultural studies at that point in time

699
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,039
is a certain gender blindness if you

700
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,659
look at let's say the early cultural

701
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,059
studies tradition uh those that did

702
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,740
research on subcultures by and large

703
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,900
looked at new sculptures as you could

704
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,799
say boyish masculine use cultures yeah

705
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,000
so there's certainly a certain gender

706
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,460
blindness in the kind of resistant youth

707
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,080
cultural literature

708
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,940
however this has increasingly been

709
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,039
addressed in subsequent work partially

710
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,440
this kind of Club cultures literature

711
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,360
that I mentioned also by the work of

712
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,279
artists such as Angela mcrobbie who was

713
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,720
part of the early British cultural

714
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,580
studies tradition is now a professor at

715
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,000
the goldsmiths college and it was really

716
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,500
addressed this kind of literature this

717
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,080
kind of gender dimension of uh of

718
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,860
cultural studies

719
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,720
another order and this is certainly a

720
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,279
book I can well the other book also but

721
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,380
I can certainly um recommend you to read

722
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,179
this book if only because it's a very

723
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,100
pleasant read it's beautifully written

724
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,140
and it's not a thick book I think it has

725
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,299
around 200 Pages Max I think it's pretty

726
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,500
uh pretty readable

727
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,299
uh and his and then he's written many

728
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,799
things on everyday life but this is

729
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,659
perhaps the most heavily cited book the

730
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,200
practice of everyday life from 1984 the

731
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,820
having said the term that the English

732
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,760
translations from 1984 if I'm not

733
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,440
mistaken it might be later that the

734
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,299
original French day is actually from

735
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,279
that time I I will need to look it up I

736
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,120
forgot

737
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,279
is beautifully written it's perhaps more

738
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,620
poetic I would say and less political

739
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,080
than British cultural studies or at

740
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,020
least Less in your face political uh but

741
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,140
it has a vocabulary I think that is um

742
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,020
uh has been very influential

743
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,080
um according to the Sato where Society

744
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,120
is is largely shaped and I think the by

745
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,100
the binary nature of it the way he

746
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,779
phrase it has been has been criticized

747
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,120
but still the the

748
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,039
um it has been very influential but

749
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,620
according to this the society's largely

750
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,320
shaped by tactics versus strategies or

751
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,059
strategies versus tactics in that order

752
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,059
perhaps with a kind of states

753
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,400
by and large he's French right so to see

754
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,960
who puts the states very Central perhaps

755
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,120
even more so than the economy

756
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,860
um devises all kinds of let's say

757
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,960
strategies structures orders of social

758
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,159
life against which uh we as Citizens as

759
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,679
as groups although it has a relatively

760
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,080
individual Focus device all kinds of

761
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,860
tactics in order to resist to to avoid

762
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,020
to intervene

763
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,419
um so all kinds of creative ways of of

764
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,640
dealing with dealing with strategies and

765
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,320
sort of turning it around and doing

766
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,600
something else with it this is the kind

767
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,880
of literature right that which as I said

768
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,860
the binary nature of it that this idea

769
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,419
that there is such a thing as strategies

770
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,700
let's say top-down strategies versus

771
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,500
bottom-up tactics because that's the

772
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,659
kind of image you see is problematic

773
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,059
it's too simplistic I think but it has

774
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,340
very much shaped this idea that we have

775
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,080
let's say uh media cultures shaping uh

776
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,299
shaping things but we are also creative

777
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,220
consumers we can actually change and

778
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,880
creatively interpret things yeah

779
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,279
gives a very Urban angle to this it

780
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,020
really talks a lot about let's say

781
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,419
walking in the city for example some of

782
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,760
the walking literature and walking

783
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,200
um there's a door is one of the key

784
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,880
artists there and it really looks at

785
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,500
okay obviously there's a city which has

786
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,940
been designed and structured and

787
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,220
constructed in a certain way but we as

788
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,440
soon as we can walk in the city and sort

789
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,500
of adapt and use a different line route

790
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,020
of walking Etc and in ways not intended

791
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,820
by the designers

792
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,380
so it doesn't lead to a kind of

793
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,299
literature any kind of reading reading

794
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:47,460
which looks at tactics everyday

795
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,380
practices I would say the practice of

796
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,960
everyday life as situated it's often

797
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,960
very local sometimes as defensive in in

798
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,620
defense uh yeah in defense too but also

799
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,600
sometimes opportunistic you sort of pick

800
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,520
up on some structured elements and do

801
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,620
something else with it so that's the

802
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,120
kind of literature and especially kind

803
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,700
of vocabulary which again has shaped a

804
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,760
lot of things this idea of of of

805
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,440
achieved a lot of research uh on on

806
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,159
Urban sorry on everyday life

807
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,919
okay

808
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,380
that's my first part I will I'm just

809
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,760
going to quick look but I see no one

810
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,200
entering anymore because now I have

811
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
pretty much all

812
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,700
chat box not a box is open

813
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,980
um are there any questions on this first

814
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,380
part as a kind of

815
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,260
uh first corner I see a question from

816
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,980
Vera as James Scott can you maybe

817
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,419
explain this very critical brief

818
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,659
question

819
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,700
I don't see you so you're gonna have to

820
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,460
sort of speak up now I was just thinking

821
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,740
about the the work of uh the the circle

822
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Michelle that you mentioned yeah and

823
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,779
actually also James Carter is from the

824
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,600
the same period he published the the

825
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,419
everyday life experience of the pleasant

826
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,820
Etc yeah and he spoke about this uh

827
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,059
infrapolitics and Mathis stuff

828
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,380
absolutely no it's it's very much part

829
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,960
of the state the same reasoning so one

830
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,100
of the other books that I could have

831
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,600
mentioned deep raps but it has been less

832
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,600
influential in in urban studies but

833
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,880
there's a great book by by James Scott

834
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
also seeing like a state

835
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,620
which is basically this this kind of

836
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,840
logic it's the kind of see like States

837
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,600
you could replace that with the with the

838
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,140
dosato vocabulary of strategies and then

839
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,020
you have citizens people communities

840
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,580
these profitable community oriented

841
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,679
they're partially shaped I think by his

842
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,899
anthropological backgrounds which is

843
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,059
which devise all kinds of tactics as

844
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,740
ways of resistance no absolutely it's

845
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,380
it's that kind of that kind of debate

846
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,620
yeah good question

847
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,899
any other questions on this first point

848
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,539
if so just speak up because that's easy

849
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:02,100
for me than go through the whole list of

850
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,820
people

851
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,220
no

852
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,140
okay

853
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,179
then I'll continue with the second Parts

854
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,700
well yeah indeed

855
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,640
so a couple of lines of research that

856
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,860
are let's say more contemporary so

857
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,539
current lines of research within Urban

858
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:24,480
studies that focus on Urban culture

859
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,640
with an interdisciplinary over studies I

860
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,440
think here we definitely move beyond the

861
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,059
realm of urban geography narrowly

862
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,940
defined and I want to discuss with you

863
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,100
today

864
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,820
um

865
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,799
the reason why I spend a fair amount of

866
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,360
attention to the previous argument to

867
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,980
the previous debate is also because as

868
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,019
you will see in the discussion that now

869
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,179
follows is that the kind of vocabulary

870
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,159
that these kinds of debates use are very

871
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,559
still influenced knowingly or

872
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,260
unknowingly unknowingly so by the

873
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,080
previous discussions so by both issues

874
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,820
on the symbolic economy postmodern

875
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,399
urbanism informality in everyday life so

876
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,500
that really still shapes I think some of

877
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,419
these current debates

878
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,460
I will now discuss all possible

879
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,040
directions uh in in interdisciplinary

880
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,560
over studies on Urban culture if only

881
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,379
because culture is such a let's say

882
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,960
a slippery concept and and research has

883
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,399
to really explode in all kinds of

884
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,379
directions and as led to all kinds we

885
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,320
could say sub-disciplines uh or or let's

886
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,599
say certain strands of research that

887
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,480
that would be impossible to do uh in uh

888
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,659
in a two-hour uh lecture so I've been

889
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,300
quite let's say uh selective the

890
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,859
selection has been purely based on my

891
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,839
own preferences in a sense that I'm

892
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,580
going to discuss with you the number of

893
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,440
strands of research that I consider to

894
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,940
be interesting or the most interesting

895
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,399
strands of research obviously I also

896
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,080
consider to be this the more to be the

897
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,179
more productive strands of research and

898
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,280
a lot of research is being done in this

899
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,560
uh in this kind of field

900
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,300
the first round of research I want to

901
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,339
discuss with you and again I'll pause at

902
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,980
the end of this trend is around the Arts

903
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,680
activism and urban engagement

904
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,760
um

905
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,619
research on the Arts of course there is

906
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,000
an established tradition obviously

907
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,700
primarily in the humanities of aesthetic

908
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,760
analysis of the Arts yeah so of painting

909
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,880
of music of theater mostly actually as

910
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,099
an increasingly so diverse uh

911
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,560
differentiating into different

912
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,780
disciplines so we'll have musicology you

913
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,220
will have tiered studies you will have

914
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,820
let's see art history or visual studies

915
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,140
and those are established editions

916
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,000
afterwards histories reaching back 100

917
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,700
years yeah

918
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,680
Urban studies and even as an

919
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,359
interdisciplinary field Builds on these

920
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,240
Traditions but actually it's primarily

921
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,760
uses a sociological and or political

922
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,440
economic approach towards the arts and

923
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,599
culture so some of the elements I will

924
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,400
discuss here they certainly do not

925
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,200
capture the diversity offer let's say

926
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,760
research on the Arts that is out there

927
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,940
yeah but um they do pretty much capture

928
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,980
I think what's out there within within

929
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,339
nervous studies

930
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:01,079
social scientific approach towards the

931
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,000
Arts obviously shapes the kinds of

932
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,300
questions being asked so one the result

933
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,060
of this is that we also see through the

934
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,560
let's say the critical focus on let's

935
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,140
say the political economy of the Arts we

936
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,560
also see it about in many or with many

937
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,960
orders and many in many Publications and

938
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
interest in the political or critical

939
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,820
potential and practice of the Arts yeah

940
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,760
this is partially also a response to

941
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,140
um and that's something I will not

942
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,660
discuss in detail here to a relatively

943
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,160
dominant debate on the creative and

944
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,960
cultural Industries which has really

945
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,079
shaped I think the debate on the Arts uh

946
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,599
in the last 20 years this idea that

947
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,800
creative and cultural Industries

948
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,200
contribute to to let's see our

949
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,119
contemporary knowledge economy that

950
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,280
there are key economic sectors in in our

951
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,619
in our current cities and thus with a

952
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:51,420
strong focus on economic dimensions of

953
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,380
culture

954
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,000
is interesting you could say the

955
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,560
political potential uh the critical

956
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,420
potential of the Arts is also partially

957
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,520
irresponsiveness there are longer

958
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,900
Traditions I will discuss some of them

959
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,119
but this is a way of also trying to look

960
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,740
at the creative Industries debate

961
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,599
critically and say okay well actually we

962
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,880
miss out on a lot when we do not address

963
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,040
the let's say the the resistant

964
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,780
dimensions of the Arts

965
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,040
now that dream well there are many of

966
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,900
course but I'm summarize them here as as

967
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,760
three main lines of urban research on

968
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,220
the Arts and I will discuss them uh

969
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,280
briefly in turn one and perhaps the most

970
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,800
established line of research uh also

971
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,320
because it ties in I think with a with a

972
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,680
history of research in the

973
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,440
uh well in in in our Theory basically in

974
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,599
an art history is research on public

975
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,020
arts and or site-specific Arts the terms

976
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,220
overlap

977
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,440
a second line of research is research on

978
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,599
artists and urban social movements the

979
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,640
relation between artistic practice and

980
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,260
urban social movements and of course

981
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,359
with social movements we can establish

982
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:57,119
debate within Urban studies also

983
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,220
and the third literature is literature

984
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,420
that is perhaps the most cultural

985
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,220
studies oriented literature is

986
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,440
literature on popular culture and urban

987
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,780
politics so it's literature that that's

988
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,240
increasingly

989
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,640
um I say engaged with with let's see

990
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,900
also theoretical and philosophical

991
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,599
literature on the political uh and how

992
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,820
public culture plays a role in relation

993
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,820
to Urban political questions

994
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,400
and I will discuss of course what I mean

995
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,720
with the political here because it's not

996
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,940
institutional politics per se or if at

997
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,099
all

998
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,099
now the first line of research within uh

999
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,599
within this this section

1000
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,180
as public art or site-specific art

1001
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,760
um for your readings I I added an

1002
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,339
admittedly relatively long uh chapter uh

1003
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,040
by Rosalind Deutsche a New York theorist

1004
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,780
so apologies for the length of the of

1005
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,720
the chapter but I I included it because

1006
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,480
it's well for two reasons one goes in

1007
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,520
Deutsche is a key art theorist a key

1008
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,579
cultural theorist who very early on I

1009
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,640
think understood the the productive

1010
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,099
connections between our Theory and urban

1011
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,800
studies or geography critical geography

1012
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,920
yeah and who wrote in the 1980s and

1013
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,640
1990s a few foundational papers on uh on

1014
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,200
the Arts and the urban

1015
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,359
the the paper here is called uneven

1016
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:21,020
development public art in New York City

1017
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,220
and it basically covers how you could

1018
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,460
say a history of dealing with or

1019
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,680
engaging with public art in New York

1020
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,000
City

1021
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,400
um both by let's say local governments

1022
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,619
local the real estate developers more or

1023
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:37,140
less in Project developers and uh and

1024
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,140
artistic communities

1025
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,000
I could have chosen other articles there

1026
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,040
are many other articles possible

1027
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,780
um in the same book by the way and I

1028
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,880
think I included the full book there's

1029
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,660
also a great uh critique the feminist

1030
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,900
critique of uh of Jameson and Harvey by

1031
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,880
the way I think the the the chapters

1032
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,800
called men in space if I'm not mistaken

1033
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,320
so basically she devises it develops a

1034
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,540
feminist ethnographic critique of

1035
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,040
Jameson and Harvey so I could definitely

1036
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,619
advise you to read this also

1037
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,079
um but in this particular paper she

1038
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,460
basically

1039
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,020
develops a critique of the

1040
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,420
instrumentalization of public art so an

1041
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,800
emotion of the public by local

1042
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,780
governments and developers so this idea

1043
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,900
that public Arts the way is presented or

1044
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,579
used by local governments and developers

1045
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,200
let's say for those working more on

1046
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,300
planning in many countries you will have

1047
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,400
if you have a kind of building scheme or

1048
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,859
a local local planning project a certain

1049
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:33,300
percentage of the budget needs to be

1050
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,000
spent on public art now for those who

1051
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,180
know this in most cases this rarely

1052
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,760
leads in many cases in most cases this

1053
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,380
does not lead to very interesting types

1054
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,420
of art it's a kind of tick to box

1055
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,760
exercise in some cases of course it does

1056
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,859
so she develops the kind of critique of

1057
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:53,280
how public art is instrumentalized in

1058
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,560
order to further you could say the

1059
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,900
uneven development of New York City so

1060
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,320
it kind of shaped by Elite concerns and

1061
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,820
shape of political political economic

1062
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,560
concerns

1063
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,780
so public garden becomes a kind of

1064
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,400
legitimation device for uneven

1065
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,800
development uneven development

1066
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,960
the issue briefly refers and I mentioned

1067
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,700
here because I like the term to the term

1068
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,579
pseudo pseudo public sphere which is a

1069
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,140
critique of Alexander klug and another

1070
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,720
theorist on the sort of this idea of

1071
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,119
Harvard Martian kind of Ideal public

1072
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,700
sphere as a field of deliberation where

1073
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,900
he says well actually there's very

1074
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,380
little actual dialogue taking place but

1075
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,880
she also hints that and this is

1076
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,859
something that for example Nancy Fraser

1077
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,839
and other theorists later data also

1078
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:39,180
developed in more detail perhaps to this

1079
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,099
idea of the emerges oppositional public

1080
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,440
spheres yes there is uneven development

1081
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,780
but it kind of pseudo public sphere but

1082
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,520
we also see kind of oppositional public

1083
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,859
spheres emerging public spheres which

1084
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,020
which on top of that have a heavy

1085
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,640
emphasis on let's say cultural and

1086
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,520
aesthetic Dimensions so basically often

1087
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,260
artistic communities are related to

1088
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,260
actors being engaged in the design of

1089
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,660
oppositional public spheres and again of

1090
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,800
course this especially for those

1091
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,200
interested in the Arts has been of

1092
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,760
massive influence and thinking to what

1093
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,579
kind of role can the Arts play in in the

1094
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,320
urban and in urban development at Large

1095
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,720
now here's a nice quote Thing by

1096
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,640
Deutsche that summarizes like uh

1097
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,380
basically this this kind of idea and the

1098
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,720
critique also so the idea that art

1099
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,880
cannot assume the existence of a public

1100
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,180
what must help produce one and that the

1101
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,980
public sphere is less a physical space

1102
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,880
than a social nullify to a considerable

1103
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,099
considerable extent accepted divisions

1104
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,800
between public and non-public art

1105
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,480
potentially any exhibition venue is a

1106
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,460
public sphere and conversely the

1107
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,619
location of artworks outside privately

1108
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,500
owned galleries in parks and plazas or

1109
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,599
simply Outdoors hardly guarantees that

1110
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,220
you will address the public

1111
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,200
now I'm sure that the the this quote

1112
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,960
perhaps needs a bit of unpacking right

1113
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,520
um but basically what she's trying to

1114
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,339
get at here is in the first sentence is

1115
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,079
that we cannot assume that by simply

1116
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,960
let's say putting public art on a Public

1117
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,839
Square for example we cannot assume that

1118
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,119
we automatically address the public yeah

1119
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,220
people just don't mind not engage with

1120
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,040
it uh people just that might just be

1121
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,500
there but but that doesn't really make

1122
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,079
it public right we can only make it

1123
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,060
public if it actually is actively engage

1124
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,460
with people so you actually you actually

1125
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,800
have to construct a public and this is

1126
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,420
more than what most public Arts

1127
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,440
supposedly public art achieves yeah

1128
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,960
at this so this this is the first

1129
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,339
question the question you're the first

1130
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,800
critique she has the second line is okay

1131
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,079
we we this actually leads If You Think

1132
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,760
Through The Logical conclusions of this

1133
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,140
it means that

1134
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,940
it uh simply by putting uh arts in the

1135
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,339
out in the open doesn't make public art

1136
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,960
but it also means that for example we

1137
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,200
can have public arts in a gallery yeah

1138
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,240
as long as you engage with the public

1139
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,980
this obviously would constitute public

1140
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,319
art so she critiques this distinction

1141
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,960
within much of our theory of that time

1142
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,740
uh that that relied on this idea that uh

1143
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,780
a critique of let's say Modern Art is

1144
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,760
that you move out of move out of the

1145
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,680
gallery and into the public she says

1146
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,780
well actually yes that's a good idea but

1147
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,220
it doesn't really make for public art

1148
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,300
per se

1149
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,520
so this is basically the kind of let's

1150
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,800
say dichotomy she's playing with and

1151
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,040
that are important I think to uh to um

1152
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,800
well to keep in mind

1153
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,440
short summary most important thing to

1154
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,300
keep in mind is that that we have an art

1155
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,599
object but this art object needs actual

1156
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,400
engagement with an audience with the

1157
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,099
public in order to become public yeah

1158
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,200
that's that's important to keep in mind

1159
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,440
here

1160
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,520
to make it a bit more uh concrete she

1161
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,540
she has one very famous example

1162
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,619
um by an equally famous artist although

1163
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,300
not not at the time I think he was still

1164
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,040
relatively let's say young in his career

1165
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,900
at that point in time

1166
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,180
um which is Richard Sarah's tilted Arc

1167
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,040
this example is also discussed in the in

1168
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,359
the paper by

1169
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:15,540
um uh by uh by Deutsche

1170
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,700
now as you can see on the on the image

1171
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,480
here

1172
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,119
this is quite obviously an intervention

1173
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,000
in public space right it's a massive

1174
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,339
piece of work it's a 37 meter long and

1175
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,579
3.7 meter tall steel plate on Foley

1176
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,640
Square which is uh in lower Manhattan

1177
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,319
New York yeah

1178
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,780
so if anything this this is this is a

1179
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,579
kind of public artwork that you cannot

1180
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,520
ignore obviously

1181
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,560
now the way sort of this

1182
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,599
um according to Deutsche the way sort of

1183
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,500
this

1184
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,040
um uh this artwork has been sort of uh

1185
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,599
um let's say interpreted or let's say

1186
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,640
received and it really shows some of the

1187
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,680
problems of of public art as she she

1188
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,480
made as she sees it

1189
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,800
um some of you could say some of the

1190
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,079
more conservative voices or sort of use

1191
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,180
of the public space heavily criticize

1192
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,880
this this piece of piece of art because

1193
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,220
it basically it blocks their way of

1194
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,020
Passage obviously right if you look at

1195
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,500
the image uh it it it completely makes

1196
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,900
impossible the usage of of the of the

1197
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,859
Public Square by um by uh let's say

1198
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,720
workers working moving from one building

1199
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,140
to the next yeah at the same time uh

1200
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,520
Deutsche argues well this doesn't

1201
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,500
necessarily make it public arts and some

1202
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,240
of the exaggerated claims made by

1203
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,240
critical let's say Defenders of of this

1204
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,339
piece of work uh they have really

1205
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,440
focused you could say on assumptions as

1206
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,680
the shifts in behavior of disposed uses

1207
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,599
of this space so without actually

1208
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,460
talking to people without actually

1209
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,380
engaging with their own interests they

1210
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,359
have assumed that the very fact that

1211
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,040
people had to sort of re-articulate

1212
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,560
their let's say everyday practices that

1213
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,480
that led to a more aesthetic engagement

1214
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,760
with the public space

1215
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,380
now according to Deutsche the main

1216
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,980
problem of the the discourse around this

1217
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,260
this piece of art as well as the piece

1218
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,720
of art itself is that it relied on a

1219
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,000
very narrow aesthetic reading so

1220
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,640
ignoring actual uses of urban space to

1221
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,040
very generic claims on ecstatic uses of

1222
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,680
the square yeah so actually it's a kind

1223
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,160
of public art Intervention which refuses

1224
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,079
to be public because it doesn't engage

1225
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,300
in any sense with the public so this

1226
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,220
idea that the public involves a dialogue

1227
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,319
is completely ignored in this sense it's

1228
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,220
basically and ultimately a strong artist

1229
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,940
figure putting an art piece in a Public

1230
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,980
Square without actually becoming part

1231
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,260
and engaging with the public now this

1232
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,300
piece was also removed in 1989 after

1233
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,060
years of of critique but that's perhaps

1234
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,900
a side note for the debate here

1235
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,240
the counter example uh perhaps

1236
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,859
oppositional public sphere You could

1237
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:54,720
argue that that Deutsche uses and I

1238
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,599
think this is a an artwork that that has

1239
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,099
also been picked up by artists such as

1240
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:01,319
Neil Smith who also wrote a piece on

1241
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:02,400
this

1242
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,079
um it's just of what just caused the

1243
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,900
homeless vehicle project also a public

1244
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,060
art space but a different kind of animal

1245
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,640
so here in this case the vehicle decided

1246
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,380
that I had a lab by the way when looking

1247
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,640
at this picture because I'm pretty sure

1248
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,619
it is the Trump Tower in the back but

1249
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:18,100
that's something else

1250
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,819
[Music]

1251
00:48:19,819 --> 00:48:22,380
which at that point in time had less of

1252
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,480
a less of symbolic value perhaps in it

1253
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,339
than it has now

1254
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:27,720
um that's a different kind of animal

1255
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,540
it's also public art

1256
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,180
um also metal in many ways but here it's

1257
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,220
a vehicle designed by artists by the

1258
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,960
artist sorry and singular in

1259
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,420
consultation with homeless people and it

1260
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,920
was seen in a different way it was seen

1261
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,260
as a practical tool for managing

1262
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,780
everyday life of the homeless so in this

1263
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,400
thing which you can let's say expand

1264
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,540
when uh once when when when uh placed

1265
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,300
somewhere uh it was a space for washing

1266
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,099
for sleeping but also for storage space

1267
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,260
for example for collecting empty bottles

1268
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,700
or something

1269
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,180
um so all this in into one one vehicle

1270
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,099
vehicle sorry

1271
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,500
this was both an exhibition object which

1272
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,420
was exhibited in you could say classic

1273
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,760
galleries as well as an objects for

1274
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,800
actually making visible the homeless in

1275
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,119
public space

1276
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,160
so it's it I think on the base of this

1277
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,020
example you already feel a bit to kind

1278
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,780
of did let's say different approach uh

1279
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,200
used uh towards the public by this this

1280
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,119
piece of work or by the previous piece

1281
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,460
by by Richard Sarah because here there

1282
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,200
is an engagement with specific Urban

1283
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,260
users highly marginalized you use on top

1284
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,140
of this uh and thus implicitly or

1285
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,060
explicitly a critique of uneven Urban

1286
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,099
developments because it's a piece of

1287
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:43,619
work that is situated in public space

1288
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,540
and makes visible you could say the

1289
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,680
effects of on the Urban Development on a

1290
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,400
wider group of let's say Urban users

1291
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:02,000
see whoops all right to my screens here

1292
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,480
okay maybe to wrap up here on this on

1293
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,599
this first strand of of research so

1294
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,339
these are all examples of site-specific

1295
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,740
art that that that moved art beyond the

1296
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,140
exhibition space into the urban so there

1297
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,940
was a thing within our Theory and art

1298
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,859
and art history kind of internal

1299
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,900
critique of the art worlds we have to

1300
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,880
move out of the museums out of the

1301
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,640
galleries but also a broadening or and

1302
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,280
and sort of as a result of that also a

1303
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,079
broadening of aesthetic debates to wider

1304
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:32,700
social concerns

1305
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,760
so this then leads to to Notions such as

1306
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,800
going by critically in this case by by

1307
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,660
Health Foster such as the Artist as a

1308
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,579
sonographer which looks at the role of

1309
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:43,560
the artist in the collaborative process

1310
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,660
or the or the Artist as a participant

1311
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,160
Observer so the artist has an

1312
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,780
ethnographer

1313
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,599
um so a critique of foster is also I

1314
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,099
think this has been picked up in in

1315
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:54,960
later work also is that the

1316
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,880
globalization of our market and this is

1317
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,260
where let's say different disciplinary

1318
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,599
debates also become interesting that the

1319
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,579
globalization of the Art Market this is

1320
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:04,200
something rarely addressed sufficiently

1321
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,180
I think in urban studies leads for

1322
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,800
example to commissioning of artists to

1323
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,500
produce a community-based site-specific

1324
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,720
artworks however without the clear

1325
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,240
knowledge of the local context so we see

1326
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,280
let's say the bayonet by and biannual

1327
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,319
Logic for example the Art Festival logic

1328
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,380
where artists are are flown into

1329
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,640
particular sites in order to develop

1330
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,619
community-based work but they rarely

1331
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,079
know the community so often these are uh

1332
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,380
let's say only superficially speaking uh

1333
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,240
Public Works uh of works of public Arts

1334
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,640
and again so much of this was

1335
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,079
foreshadowed a thing by the work of

1336
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,760
Deutsche also but of course also others

1337
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,040
at this point in time

1338
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,460
okay

1339
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,940
so that's the first strand of research

1340
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,920
a second strand of research is around

1341
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,900
Artisans Urban social movements and of

1342
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,859
course I'm making analytical

1343
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:57,480
distinctions here in practice some of

1344
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,099
these debates overlap and there are

1345
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,260
interactions but for the purpose of

1346
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,640
discussion I think it's helpful to keep

1347
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,500
them a bit separate

1348
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,359
so the second strand of research tries

1349
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:07,859
to look at artists and Earth social

1350
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:09,540
movements so there's a long-standing

1351
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,980
tradition obviously

1352
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,920
of artists engaging in social movements

1353
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,020
but mostly those have been researched I

1354
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,780
would argue outside of urban studies

1355
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:20,760
again within let's say the the the the

1356
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,400
the field specific debates such as

1357
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,099
theater or such as as our visual studies

1358
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:27,960
Etc or art history

1359
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,440
within our studies I think uh most of

1360
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,319
the recent debates in this area has been

1361
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,940
on the critique of the creative class

1362
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,800
and creative Industries policies has

1363
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,260
already hinted that or perhaps

1364
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,480
neoliberal or entrepreneurial urbanism

1365
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,760
more widely so what kind of role do

1366
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,180
artists play in or part of urban social

1367
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,700
movements and critiquing you could say

1368
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,880
the neo-liberalization of of the urban

1369
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,140
now it is a nice paper actually by

1370
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,900
Johannes Novi and Claire colon who many

1371
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,720
of you have seen attended today who

1372
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,280
wrote a nice paper on struggling for the

1373
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,020
right to the creative City in Berlin and

1374
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,980
Hamburg and where they give a nice brief

1375
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,079
brief but nice overview I think of urban

1376
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:16,020
social movements uh so it's a kind of

1377
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,839
literature which I'd well we don't

1378
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:20,339
really discuss a thing in our social

1379
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:22,140
geography that's an important literature

1380
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,240
which moves from the history of

1381
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,520
squatting and demonstrations against a

1382
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,800
renewal uh politics to Urban Counter

1383
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,240
Culture

1384
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,339
um and then zoom in on the role of

1385
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:33,720
artists and cultural workers in

1386
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,300
contesting uh called creative class and

1387
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,520
creative Industries politics now there's

1388
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,020
a lot that can be said about this but

1389
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,400
what is interesting here of course is

1390
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,140
that automatically the debate becomes

1391
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,760
you could say sociological or social

1392
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,040
scientific because the moment you start

1393
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,359
looking at artists within social

1394
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,099
movements you can no longer look just at

1395
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,079
their aesthetic Expressions but you

1396
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,579
automatically have to look at what is

1397
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:55,920
practically speaking their role with an

1398
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,319
often quite heterogeneous diverse

1399
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,900
composition of protest movements so we

1400
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,700
see artists collaborating with diverse

1401
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,099
set of actors and that of course shapes

1402
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,619
their artistic practice

1403
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,359
the role of artists here at least this

1404
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,520
is what no vehicle highlights uh

1405
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,380
highlights strongly I think they they

1406
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,720
are definitely on to something there is

1407
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,579
that artists and to some extent have a

1408
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,319
privileged role or a particular role

1409
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:21,420
within Urban social movements because

1410
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,400
they have access to an experience with

1411
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,740
media networks and a familiarity with

1412
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,140
communication techniques so this then

1413
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,880
leads to a discussion around the role of

1414
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,220
artists in in how let's say particular

1415
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,619
Urban conflicts are framed and reframed

1416
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:37,740
by artists in an often in visual or

1417
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,819
other ways

1418
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:43,200
now there are many examples you can

1419
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,640
discuss here this is one example

1420
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,040
discussed also in the in the article of

1421
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,220
the media protest in Berlin uh for those

1422
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,660
that know Berlin you will know probably

1423
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,280
also know sort of the history a bit of

1424
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,660
media I should be I will now discuss

1425
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,700
this here it's a big Urban Development

1426
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,140
uh area uh on let's say well the

1427
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,700
southern part of free design northern

1428
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,800
part of course pack

1429
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,520
um

1430
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,920
partially which really let's let the

1431
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,079
counter mobilization uh because this is

1432
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,000
also the area which is let's say you

1433
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,940
have a a concentration of artistic and

1434
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,420
and and Leisure and clubbing activity so

1435
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,000
here's a one

1436
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,800
simple example where sort of artists you

1437
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,839
could say have been involved in

1438
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:26,700
developing different let's say visual

1439
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,319
Aesthetics in a sense this basically

1440
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,420
ironically Builds on the B Berlin

1441
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,220
branding scheme so for those who don't

1442
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,500
know it just Google it and it uses the

1443
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,099
same kind of design but then changes the

1444
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:39,839
kind of language right and sort of

1445
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,359
ironically so instead of being hip being

1446
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:45,240
creative and being uh how to translate

1447
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,440
that if I can translate that being

1448
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,599
well used and thrown away so to speak

1449
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,359
modifiable yeah commodifiables perhaps

1450
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:55,920
the closest yeah thank you very very

1451
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,839
good point for real bus sounds better

1452
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,240
though but you're right commodifiable

1453
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,780
and they replace it by size

1454
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,700
so it could be self

1455
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,180
Again difficult to try itself uh

1456
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,359
um

1457
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,480
independent something along those lines

1458
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,760
solidarity solidarity uh and be

1459
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,579
resistance so stop gentrification so

1460
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,319
this is one example

1461
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,420
other examples of course not discussing

1462
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,760
this particular article but um

1463
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,319
uh from other

1464
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,260
um other sites of course this kind of

1465
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,119
artistic let's say framing of political

1466
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,640
and urban conflicts ties in with a much

1467
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,099
much longer history of Art and pro-step

1468
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,680
protest most obviously in street art as

1469
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,240
well as graphic design so there are a

1470
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,220
couple of examples that are let's say

1471
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,780
illustrative of this but certainly not

1472
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,180
exhaustive so on the top right you see a

1473
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,920
performance protest of an extension

1474
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,500
extension Extinction Rebellion uh

1475
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,960
protest in London uh do the middle left

1476
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,359
I think has been quite a similar visible

1477
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,119
to most if you would think black lives

1478
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:01,800
matter paint the street I think this one

1479
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,559
indeed Washington DC or to the bottom

1480
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,960
right

1481
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,859
a a

1482
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:10,200
claim State well if a painting stating

1483
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,260
the load to the debt repayments uh on

1484
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,480
Street Arts intervention in Buenos Aires

1485
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,819
yeah and I could have used many many

1486
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:20,280
other examples but just to give a sense

1487
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,440
of uh of the various sort of artists

1488
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,319
play a role in in urban social movements

1489
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,420
or at least early protests if it's less

1490
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,880
organized than than a social movement

1491
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,040
and again this has a much much longer

1492
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,700
history uh going back uh many many years

1493
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,559
some would argue since the emergence of

1494
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:40,140
industrialization in many ways

1495
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,319
about where are you

1496
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:45,839
so the last

1497
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,260
one yeah sorry

1498
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,119
so the last round within this section

1499
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,640
that I want to discuss with you

1500
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,500
um is popular cultural and urban

1501
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,240
politics

1502
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,040
um this is last you could say less

1503
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,079
around Urban social movement it also

1504
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:03,420
lasts around the art world as such but

1505
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,040
more about more broader cultural

1506
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,440
expressions so here we really go back to

1507
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,000
the classical core of cultural studies

1508
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,280
that I discussed before with you to use

1509
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,200
the focus on popular culture

1510
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,200
as in everyday life as questioning

1511
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,700
Authority but also as imagining

1512
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,700
political Alternatives so the kind of

1513
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,460
language that we then uh use or see use

1514
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,140
in this kind of research is that there's

1515
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,660
a it's about politics Beyond governments

1516
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,700
and politicians to work on the street

1517
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,339
Politics As I said about called it or

1518
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:34,200
also kind of informalization and this is

1519
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,119
where the informality the term pops up

1520
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:38,579
again as you see informalization of the

1521
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:41,460
State uh as for example Julian Boudreau

1522
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,400
has called it a nice nice book by the

1523
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,520
way

1524
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,960
again there are many many examples here

1525
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,740
to to to to to to to discuss the classic

1526
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,780
case I would argue in this in this field

1527
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,780
of research is hip-hop or rap rap music

1528
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,160
more narrowly

1529
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,079
which has been studied by now I think by

1530
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,940
multiple multiple disciplines range from

1531
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,040
musicology cultural studies anthropology

1532
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,260
but also Urban studies which

1533
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,240
traditionally has Focus I think strongly

1534
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,160
on account of classic cultural studies

1535
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,500
Community orientation Urban localities

1536
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,440
and so the hood the ghetto as classic

1537
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,440
Urban teams but which also I think in a

1538
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,599
more critical literature uh has paid

1539
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,059
attention to let's say the way rap

1540
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:26,339
hip-hop culture has become less they

1541
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:29,339
commodified in in its globalization of

1542
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:32,040
of of its cultural form yeah but also

1543
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,140
how it has been picked up by people from

1544
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,420
outside of let's say the us as as

1545
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,960
opposed to the source of of hip-hop

1546
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,359
culture so that's the classic case the

1547
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:44,099
library is full of books by now I think

1548
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:46,079
on hip-hop there's some more interesting

1549
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,240
than others this book by Murray Foreman

1550
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,059
is quite uh quite an interesting example

1551
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:51,960
though

1552
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,579
similar research has also been done in

1553
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:55,799
other genres uh typically a lot of

1554
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:57,599
attention has been paid to music we see

1555
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,160
it in other fields of activity also but

1556
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,480
music has received perhaps most

1557
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,640
attention in relation to popular culture

1558
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,839
and the political

1559
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,000
ranging from clubbing culture but also

1560
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,680
Opera a lot of political perhaps less

1561
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,500
obviously there to punk to Jazz to all

1562
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,780
kinds of other cultural expressions

1563
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:19,260
laughs

1564
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,020
now with all these strands um

1565
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,480
amount to is that they point to

1566
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,460
different aesthetic strategies to engage

1567
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,380
the urban yeah and this is something

1568
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:32,040
that uh well as as also increasingly

1569
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,799
received attention within Urban studies

1570
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,480
um in an article about team and bias I

1571
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,099
put a reference at the bottom of the

1572
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:39,960
slides it points to a number of

1573
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,380
different aesthetic strategies they as I

1574
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,819
said as a right here they are

1575
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:47,099
analytically distinct but in practice of

1576
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:48,299
course they are they can they are

1577
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,400
Messier it's some some let's say

1578
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,220
aesthetic practices might be uh involved

1579
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,619
in a number of things at the same time

1580
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,660
here we said okay we basically we have

1581
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,640
spectacle Grassroots Social Work

1582
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,680
arousing the census and you can

1583
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,420
automatically see a thing to have some

1584
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,700
of the examples I've I've shown before

1585
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,520
can be one or more of these things so

1586
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,440
let's say for example the black lives

1587
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,000
matter

1588
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,460
um let's say Banner on the street so to

1589
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,799
speak in a way you could argue this is

1590
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,020
Grassroots uh you could argue this is

1591
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,299
also social work you could argue with

1592
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,099
some some I would also arouses the

1593
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,200
senses because it's it's sometimes it

1594
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,780
questions the Norms of what these trees

1595
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,339
are for and questions different let's

1596
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:32,339
say media representations but quite

1597
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:34,500
obviously it's also spectacle because it

1598
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,500
has really sort of traveled widely and

1599
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,880
can easily be used any kind of

1600
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,339
commodification strategy almost of

1601
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:43,559
branding almost particular cities yeah

1602
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:45,119
so there are all kinds of different

1603
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,980
dimensions and it's it's an empirical

1604
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,260
question ultimately to look at concrete

1605
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,599
artistic practices to look at what the

1606
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,339
different dimensions uh let's say their

1607
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:57,180
relation to each other is

1608
01:01:57,319 --> 01:02:01,440
okay that's a long stretch for one uh

1609
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,599
one slide but it might also be one of

1610
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,480
the longer uh longer discussions

1611
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,359
uh I'll take a short break here four

1612
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,640
questions so please

1613
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,440
um just either type them in the chat or

1614
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,559
just start unmuting and speaking if if

1615
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:17,940
there are any questions on this section

1616
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,740
it gives me a chance to drink a bit of

1617
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,859
water

1618
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,880
wow that was a pre-prepared question

1619
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,400
that was a fast or unless you type very

1620
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,299
fast

1621
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:33,660
so already can answer the question uh or

1622
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,220
or a point I want to raise attention to

1623
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,440
your related phenomenon where an

1624
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,180
artistic creative approach

1625
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,599
is used in part uh of a broader

1626
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:44,280
participatory and Redevelopment strategy

1627
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,380
here's some sort of institutionalizing

1628
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,000
of arts and their movements is happening

1629
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,280
as small quirky teams of Architects

1630
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,780
planners activists and artists are

1631
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,640
leading the process and through an

1632
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,819
example and then there's a website maybe

1633
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:59,520
you can so if if I understand you

1634
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,079
correctly we won't look at the example

1635
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:02,640
now

1636
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,579
then it's your point being that artists

1637
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:07,980
can actually be become Urban developers

1638
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,460
themselves

1639
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,359
will be good

1640
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:17,099
I don't see you so you have to I have to

1641
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,660
unmute the weekend now I see you but

1642
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,180
you're immunity all right sorry

1643
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,000
um yeah uh exactly like artists are

1644
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,720
becoming part of the planning process or

1645
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,819
more I think that the

1646
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:34,740
um I think the low threshold uh approach

1647
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,140
of like artistic experimental like

1648
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,880
creativeness

1649
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,420
as being employed in order to like

1650
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,900
justify maybe participatory processes or

1651
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,420
lead to a more like inclusion of people

1652
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:52,020
or like let them participate participate

1653
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,839
in the first place but also just to uh

1654
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:57,780
get uh the people on board and create

1655
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,720
some sort of tolerance so they this one

1656
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,720
would be like the creative what is it

1657
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,299
called the Festival of creative Urban

1658
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:09,480
living in Milton Keynes

1659
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,220
um the UK England uh so yeah it's like

1660
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,160
uh it sounds like coming from a very

1661
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,160
like dry urban planning background this

1662
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,520
is like a weird thing to do because

1663
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,500
people who are attending this they're

1664
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,540
usually not aware of the broader scope

1665
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,280
of this whole development that's

1666
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,079
happening to them

1667
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,960
um so that's just interesting to to also

1668
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,940
take absolutely it's a good addition

1669
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,380
something that I don't explicitly

1670
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,240
mention here but it's a it's a

1671
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,160
relatively new trend I think certainly

1672
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,960
something that we see more and more of

1673
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,059
the last I mean it was there before but

1674
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:46,619
it has become more visible I think in

1675
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:48,420
the last 10 years

1676
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,880
um I would still argue though that the

1677
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,680
same kind of critical vocabulary already

1678
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,599
introduced by Deutsche is also necessary

1679
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,640
for these projects because in some of

1680
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,020
these projects or initiatives at least

1681
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:01,079
we do see a relatively instrumental or

1682
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:04,200
instrumentalization of artists I.E not

1683
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,940
the one artist is not the other artists

1684
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,480
right so we see certain artists

1685
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,400
um standing up as entrepreneurs you

1686
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,500
could say and becoming project

1687
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,839
developers in relatively uncritical ways

1688
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,059
and I can name some examples also in

1689
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,299
Brussels where there's um where this is

1690
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:24,299
happening which actually leads to a fair

1691
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:27,359
amount of uh critique also within the

1692
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,339
artistic Community yeah and I wouldn't

1693
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:32,160
say uh that this is like necessarily

1694
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,140
like a bad or a good thing like the

1695
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,000
themes that are involved are like really

1696
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,599
good uh teams but it's just uh like

1697
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,460
always like look look very critical

1698
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,680
because also the urban governments try

1699
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,640
sometimes to use this strategy in a very

1700
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,680
deceiving way yeah okay excellent thank

1701
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,540
you I see another calendar or comment

1702
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,880
literally by Vera

1703
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,780
please unmute

1704
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,640
yeah but but you already write this

1705
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:03,480
critic from the what is her name yeah

1706
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,599
and he's also the critic from zurkin

1707
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,240
like did this tricky fact of the art to

1708
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,599
be also the vehicle of the

1709
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:15,839
gentrification and and stuff so uh

1710
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,940
it's always super tricky to speak about

1711
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,119
the art and it's potential in urban

1712
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,059
space let's say yeah absolutely so I'll

1713
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:25,740
give another example later on I think

1714
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,799
also which which is and the article I

1715
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:31,619
mentioned by uh sorry was uh I can't go

1716
01:06:31,619 --> 01:06:33,960
back I can't go back I buy Timon base

1717
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,640
also mentioned some of these

1718
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,099
ambivalences that are seemingly

1719
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:40,020
unavoidable so to speak there's no pure

1720
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:42,180
space in that sense okay excellent and

1721
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,780
then there's Max also has a comment

1722
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:49,140
yeah just to add on this point that uh

1723
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,880
urica raised and this theme of

1724
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,359
institutionalization and

1725
01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:56,819
instrumentalization of of Art and

1726
01:06:56,819 --> 01:06:59,700
artists I think Amsterdam is actually an

1727
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,740
interesting example because there is

1728
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,039
this Municipal policy which could be

1729
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,700
translated as the breeding ground policy

1730
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,380
whereby the city assigns certain

1731
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:14,579
buildings as available for workshops and

1732
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:15,799
for artists

1733
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:18,660
to work there and often it's also very

1734
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,119
related to

1735
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:21,839
um

1736
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,200
yeah strategy actually to gentrify a

1737
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,599
particular area I don't know whether

1738
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,359
there's any research done on this plus

1739
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,579
maybe you know uh yeah it has been

1740
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:34,020
definitely also by the Amsterdam

1741
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,280
colleagues who also have a strong Urban

1742
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,900
studies research Tradition at the

1743
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,339
University of Amsterdam but also others

1744
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:40,380
uh no no that has been critical research

1745
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,760
being done at the Netherlands is a

1746
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,079
particular case it's an interesting case

1747
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:45,480
in any case because it's it's very less

1748
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,099
the advanced and professional and it is

1749
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:49,619
instrumentalization of the Arts on the

1750
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:52,319
urban level and the brute plus and the

1751
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:56,160
breeding policy policy is yeah it's it's

1752
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,680
striking in the way it's sort of

1753
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,839
well use and test positive side effects

1754
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:03,539
also but the way it literally uses the

1755
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:06,000
Arts in in relatively classical Urban

1756
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,559
Development strategies that's that's

1757
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:10,140
that's definitely uh true yeah no the

1758
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,119
research has been done in that yeah

1759
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:13,799
okay excellent thank you for the

1760
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:16,020
comments they they really add some very

1761
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,479
important uh additional thoughts here

1762
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,399
other points

1763
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,219
if not I continue with the third part uh

1764
01:08:23,219 --> 01:08:26,540
of the presentation and that's the the

1765
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:29,640
another section or direction of research

1766
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,140
on the

1767
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,319
uh on the Arts well also on on culture

1768
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,198
uh and the urban this is what I would

1769
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,120
call or this this is basically my label

1770
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,380
but I think it's what I would call

1771
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,359
research on cultural infrastructures and

1772
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:44,279
informal urbanism so that's whether

1773
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:45,779
that's in the literature on your formula

1774
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:48,660
actually starts uh broadening to let's

1775
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,060
say a literature on on informal urbanism

1776
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,620
which might be a phrase that you've come

1777
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,479
across also a number of times

1778
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,880
and this overlaps the thing in recent

1779
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,319
years where increasing attention has

1780
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,399
been paid to let's see the

1781
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:00,899
infrastructural dimension of urban

1782
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:03,060
cultures some Scholars have already

1783
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,339
talked about an infrastructural turn I I

1784
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:07,439
dislike talking about terms because it's

1785
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,339
very

1786
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:10,380
claiming a new fashion and it helps to

1787
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,020
get cited more but uh yeah there's some

1788
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,299
all these things built on all on older

1789
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:17,640
interest also having said that there is

1790
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,080
obviously more and more attention being

1791
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,540
paid within Urban studies to let's see

1792
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,939
questions of infrastructure uh and not

1793
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:26,698
just narrowly defined but a very diverse

1794
01:09:26,698 --> 01:09:28,799
types of infrastructure as you will see

1795
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,719
now let's hear one example I think which

1796
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,698
is a good example of it discussed by the

1797
01:09:32,698 --> 01:09:34,319
team and base article that I mentioned

1798
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,880
before

1799
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,319
um which you discussed in this article

1800
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:39,238
is it is is the work of the

1801
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:42,120
chicago-based artist yester Gates as

1802
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,219
some of you might know him

1803
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:46,560
um where to the left you see a piece

1804
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,020
that you did for the documentary

1805
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,260
well not biannual but documentary five

1806
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:58,560
yearly uh Festival in Castle so the

1807
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,660
documentary 2013 which I think was in

1808
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,260
2012. if I'm correct uh 12 ballasts for

1809
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,540
eugenotes house which basically is a

1810
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,280
restoration of an empty building in

1811
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,800
castle using labor and materials from

1812
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,480
the south side of Chicago

1813
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,460
so it's an interesting case because it

1814
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,679
was a kind of rundown building in Castle

1815
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,320
and where he had let's say we had the

1816
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,760
thoughtiest against the artists had

1817
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,400
materials but also workers moved

1818
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,620
transported so to say from Chicago to

1819
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,380
Castle to actually renovate the building

1820
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,260
and to actually perform in the building

1821
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:31,980
Etc

1822
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:34,560
so here's space and let's say the

1823
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,179
infrastructure of this space really

1824
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:38,460
emerged as a kind of social space while

1825
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,140
at the same time directing attention to

1826
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:42,900
migrant labor and in the case of of the

1827
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,580
SD Gates that is work and the kind of

1828
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,679
the issues he engages with with black

1829
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:49,080
cultural expression in a very particular

1830
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,300
space in Castle so there's a very let's

1831
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,659
see concrete artistic intervention

1832
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:57,600
to the right you see let's say the

1833
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,580
in a way the reference project for for

1834
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,820
the castle uh the castle case which is

1835
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,580
the Dorchester project or projects in

1836
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,380
Chicago which is basically you can argue

1837
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,640
and it links back I think to the

1838
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,540
previous

1839
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:13,140
um uh uh well addition raised by by the

1840
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,900
week but perhaps in the last let's say

1841
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,260
uh uh planner mode but basically this is

1842
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,300
a kind of urban development project led

1843
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,159
by Siesta gates in the south side of

1844
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:26,280
Chicago where the gate started buying up

1845
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,500
abandoned property after the 2008

1846
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,900
financial crisis and has redeveloped

1847
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,640
these buildings with local communities

1848
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,580
with other artists uh often creating a

1849
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,640
mixed of outer spaces of community

1850
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,460
spaces of let's say local restaurants or

1851
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,440
in this particular case also a library

1852
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,159
and and archive uh so the the Dorchester

1853
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:49,140
project

1854
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,699
now what's interesting here of course is

1855
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:52,199
that we we

1856
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:54,540
um we we are still in the realm of let's

1857
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,820
say issues around Urban culture but

1858
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,260
we've started paying more and more

1859
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,940
attention to okay where practically

1860
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,219
literally materially speaking are these

1861
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:04,380
are these located so this really leads

1862
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,820
them to the material infrastructure

1863
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,219
dimension of urban culture and some of

1864
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:10,260
what I consider to be some of the more

1865
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,179
interesting more productive line of

1866
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:14,460
research on Urban culture in the last

1867
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,440
years has really looked at these kind of

1868
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,120
infrastructural dimensions

1869
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,900
another pushing this a bit broader and

1870
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,699
perhaps also becoming less local and his

1871
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:32,159
orientation towards infrastructure

1872
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:36,239
is um a book that I that I added for the

1873
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,940
reading for today uh by Brian Larkin

1874
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,500
from 2008.

1875
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,260
signal and noise media infrastructure

1876
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,300
and urban culture in Nigeria

1877
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,000
which is for those that have rats I

1878
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,800
don't I don't expect you to have read

1879
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,659
the full book but maybe it may be the

1880
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,000
introduction at least

1881
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,620
which is an anthropological study on the

1882
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,020
cultural work of media Technologies

1883
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,420
this is the quote and their role in what

1884
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,400
in producing what we call Urban Africa

1885
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,699
focusing on Kano and a Muslim City in

1886
01:13:05,699 --> 01:13:07,020
Northern Islamic City and Northern

1887
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,520
Nigeria

1888
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,860
the Larkin book is interesting because

1889
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,600
it's just a very interesting book but

1890
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,300
also because he Flags a number of

1891
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,360
debates that that are let's say

1892
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,219
essential in research on infrastructures

1893
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:22,199
or in general or cultural

1894
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:23,880
infrastructures in particular

1895
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,640
one being it's not just about let's say

1896
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,460
pipes Etc and literally infrastructure

1897
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:31,800
but also a lot about the symbolic of

1898
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,300
representational logic of

1899
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,460
infrastructures so what do

1900
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,020
infrastructures mean how are they

1901
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,640
interpreted how are they envisioned how

1902
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,920
are they imagined this really receives a

1903
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,900
lot of attention I think in in most of

1904
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,060
the infrastructure research

1905
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,400
also in terms of governments to go to

1906
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,440
govern or control these infrastructures

1907
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,860
uh it gives examples of uh of this in

1908
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,840
the case of Nigeria

1909
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,000
um at the same time also the unexpected

1910
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,800
or unintended consequences of an

1911
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,080
infrastructural development governments

1912
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,520
for example or let's say our local

1913
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,640
developers can have a plan okay can have

1914
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,380
an idea as to why they want to develop a

1915
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,300
certain infrastructure but it doesn't

1916
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,920
necessarily mean that infrastructure is

1917
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,440
also used in this way so here we back a

1918
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,940
thing to perhaps to the older discussion

1919
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,980
around strategies and tactics but

1920
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,659
transpose to an infrastructural

1921
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:20,159
discussion

1922
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,600
and the other and the last element

1923
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,699
related to this of course is that around

1924
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:26,040
these infrastructures we see all kinds

1925
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,719
of informal social practices in everyday

1926
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:30,659
life emerging yeah which then are word

1927
01:14:30,659 --> 01:14:32,760
of attention but also worthy of of

1928
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,280
research so the example here I gave for

1929
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,780
example you can easily get very

1930
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,540
concretely imagine how around these

1931
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:42,719
spaces social practices emerge and are

1932
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,120
and are developed and they would perhaps

1933
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,340
not exist without these these

1934
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:48,659
infrastructures and that's the thing the

1935
01:14:48,659 --> 01:14:50,520
importance important to keep in mind

1936
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,199
here

1937
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:54,800
foreign

1938
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,880
for me the most interesting

1939
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,500
chapter in the book is perhaps the what

1940
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,820
is the last chapter if I remember

1941
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:06,140
correctly on on the role of piracy in in

1942
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,940
Nigeria so the examples he gives for

1943
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:12,300
example is is how Nigerian video

1944
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,719
and piracy a circus of distribution

1945
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,000
emerged in Nigeria uh and how this

1946
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,860
actually relates to a kind of what

1947
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,179
perhaps which goes called a full

1948
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:23,940
ecosystem of cultural but also obviously

1949
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:26,760
economic activity largely informal in

1950
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,340
the sense that it's barely regulated uh

1951
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:33,260
perhaps also uh illegal or

1952
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:35,520
illegitimate or something because it's

1953
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,620
uh often at that point in time when he

1954
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,020
did his research late 1990s early 2000s

1955
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:42,840
uh often copies illegal copies of

1956
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,420
Hollywood and Indian films but we're a

1957
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,280
bit at the same encano as a northern

1958
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,560
Nigeria City really emerging literally

1959
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,540
literally as a kind of Distribution Hub

1960
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,480
for The Wider African region yeah so

1961
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,460
with people on the right for example

1962
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,260
selling it on the street but also the

1963
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,820
same people or other people actually

1964
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,100
moving the the goods so to speak the

1965
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,840
material from one city to other cities

1966
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,780
often crossing boundaries

1967
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:09,360
now from the 1990s onwards I think we've

1968
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,760
seen an increase in production also and

1969
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,620
this is the the the argument developed

1970
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,260
by Larkin of Nigerian and especially

1971
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,960
hausa language videos leading to a quite

1972
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,820
organized system of how is that video

1973
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,580
Film Production but it building on the

1974
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,580
existing pirate infrastructure yeah so

1975
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,100
again a classic case of informal

1976
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:32,760
urbanism a very slippery or unclear

1977
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,860
distinction between where when is

1978
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,719
something still informal when does

1979
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,219
something become full because it has

1980
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:40,560
also become part to a certain extent of

1981
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,840
a formal registered economy with some

1982
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,659
businesses growing bigger and bigger but

1983
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:47,400
at the same time with for example how is

1984
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,600
the films aesthetically and

1985
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,120
organizationally still being shaped by

1986
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,520
you could say the older uh pirate

1987
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,280
Aesthetics and infrastructure yeah this

1988
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,800
is also the kind of a research which has

1989
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,360
received a lot of attention in recent

1990
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,460
years and which I have labeled here as

1991
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,320
being part of let's say research on

1992
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,179
cultural infrastructures and informal

1993
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:09,260
Urban them

1994
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,659
or to give another example a paper I

1995
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:17,940
wrote myself together with a with a PhD

1996
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,159
student a while ago

1997
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,719
gold spaces of openness Urban

1998
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:23,219
citizenship and cultural infrastructures

1999
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:25,080
have come alive in Istanbul

2000
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,000
which focused in let's say a more

2001
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,040
institutional way perhaps less

2002
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,380
ethnographic way on the institutional

2003
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,360
geography of collaboration and support

2004
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,060
to sustain local cultural spaces and

2005
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,760
networks in the shadow of the states so

2006
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,620
the argument we develop here is that in

2007
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,659
in a turkey and and partially also

2008
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,000
nistable increasingly being let's say

2009
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,300
shaped by a kind of authoritarian

2010
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,159
semi-authoritarian state in any case we

2011
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,080
discuss in some detail how particular

2012
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,060
cultural organizations salt and pepper

2013
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,920
for those that know as Istanbul they

2014
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,500
might know the organizations how they

2015
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,540
act as kind of cultural infrastructures

2016
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:03,480
of let's say common life or a different

2017
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,980
way would be saying oh actually Public

2018
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:08,460
public life in Istanbul largely by

2019
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,199
actually collaborating with very many

2020
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:12,600
other organizations but also offering

2021
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,520
spaces and this is what the image to the

2022
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,520
right shows sorry what this image shows

2023
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,920
offering spaces

2024
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,800
um uh well no sorry offering actual

2025
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,600
space in their buildings to all kinds of

2026
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,000
different organs positions so you see a

2027
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,620
kind of let's say

2028
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,659
hidden or semi-hidden cultural

2029
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:32,520
infrastructure which doesn't easily show

2030
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,260
when you look at just the main cultural

2031
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,420
organizations but which really shaped

2032
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,340
you could say cultural practices in this

2033
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:40,080
particular City and which is only

2034
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,600
possible or or in any case is made

2035
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,540
possible by the actual existence of

2036
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,880
these actual spaces in in these cities

2037
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,280
of salt and Depot

2038
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,820
so again another

2039
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:55,199
possible let's say entry point into

2040
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,300
research on cultural infrastructures and

2041
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,880
informal urbanism

2042
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,000
last Point perhaps for this slide well

2043
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
not not the level yeah last example is

2044
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,679
what we see happening in the research

2045
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,300
and cultural infrastructures much of the

2046
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,100
research on Urban culture is research

2047
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,780
that is both you could say fundamental

2048
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:16,620
let's say basic basic real academic

2049
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,600
research but it also has a strong

2050
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,280
applied nature and the notion of

2051
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,900
infrastructure has also started to

2052
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:24,600
emerging or started popping up in policy

2053
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,060
documents across the world

2054
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,699
um that has many consequences not all of

2055
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:31,380
them positive but to a large extent I

2056
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,780
think it's an interesting development

2057
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:36,500
where we let's say cultural policy

2058
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,880
documents and cultural actual cultural

2059
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,219
policy practices did not refer to

2060
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:43,199
infrastructure let's say 10 years ago we

2061
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,000
see in the last five years or so we see

2062
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,159
various organizations very local and

2063
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:49,199
Regional governments actually using the

2064
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:51,960
notion of infrastructure in order to pay

2065
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,219
attention to certain let's say

2066
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:55,080
infrastructural dimensions of of of

2067
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,260
cultural of the cultural Industries also

2068
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,960
so here are a few examples on the top

2069
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,239
left creative City News cultural

2070
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:04,920
infrastructure an integral component of

2071
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,260
Canadian communities this is quite

2072
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,000
strong and again I think it's critique

2073
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,500
of the creative Industries literature

2074
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,719
even among policy makers where you say

2075
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,820
okay we actually need a wider diversity

2076
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,219
of cultural infrastructures that

2077
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:18,840
actually connect with our local

2078
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,120
communities whatever that may mean but

2079
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,739
that's let's say the game

2080
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:25,199
or for example sustaining London as a

2081
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,360
cultural capital why London needs a

2082
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,640
cultural infrastructure plan this again

2083
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,560
is not a strand of the debate I think in

2084
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,020
policy communities where we see because

2085
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,219
of the increasing let's say

2086
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:37,199
gentrification and increasing real

2087
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,060
estate price and especially Global

2088
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:42,239
cities even policy makers let's say or

2089
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,640
let's say mainstream policy has started

2090
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,320
realizing that if we continue like this

2091
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,060
we will have no artists left in the city

2092
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,219
so we need to actually start thinking

2093
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:52,380
about the availability of cultural

2094
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,900
infrastructure in our cities and to make

2095
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,300
this available literally in order to

2096
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:00,960
sort of uh keep let's say the status of

2097
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,880
London as a global City but also as a

2098
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,920
cultural City so why London is the

2099
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,900
cultural infrastructure plan

2100
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,880
a similar debate around cultural

2101
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,620
infrastructure in New South Wales which

2102
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,199
is this mixer thing also of the Canadian

2103
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:14,820
example I just mentioned and the London

2104
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,520
example of availability of space or

2105
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,260
another example in Brussels and this is

2106
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,300
one I'm partially involved in by

2107
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,239
permanent so permanent uh the the name

2108
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,100
of the of the association pretty much

2109
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,440
sums it up which is a kind of practice

2110
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,360
based research I'm also now involved in

2111
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,860
where we try to develop an

2112
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,300
infrastructure for permanently

2113
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,040
affordable and a valid social and

2114
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,320
cultural space in Brussels so basically

2115
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,199
claiming a space in Brussels which is

2116
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:43,320
open not just to artists but also other

2117
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,600
types of users such as refugees such as

2118
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,640
social housing such as University

2119
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,520
researchers Etc in order to look at

2120
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,860
different models of ownership also where

2121
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:55,140
ours are no longer Reliant and other

2122
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,719
users on let's say temporary use but I

2123
01:21:57,719 --> 01:21:59,159
can actually let's say permanently

2124
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:01,980
literally permanently claim a space

2125
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,140
through all kinds of ownership models

2126
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:05,880
partially building on issues around

2127
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,100
unless the community land for us or

2128
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,920
social cooperatives

2129
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,239
cheese

2130
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,880
okay that's a lot of information

2131
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,880
um just to sum this up if you look at

2132
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:18,900
the cultural infrastructures and

2133
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,000
informal urbanism literature I see at

2134
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,159
least the following analytical shifts

2135
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:26,760
we have moved the thing from a concern

2136
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,199
with the informal economy and

2137
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:29,760
anthropology and development studies and

2138
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,440
everyday life tactics and cultural

2139
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,679
studies to INF to informal urbanism this

2140
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:36,480
is the term that is perhaps most present

2141
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,060
now it's no longer informality as such

2142
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:40,980
but the phrase informal urbanism you see

2143
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,659
uh constantly

2144
01:22:42,659 --> 01:22:45,360
so we've moved to a situation where

2145
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,820
um sorry here we are

2146
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:50,340
we see a continued interest in labor

2147
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,900
questions social embeddedness of

2148
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,239
economic relations and interrelation of

2149
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,100
informal networks and the formal

2150
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,600
institutions so all the classic

2151
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,420
informality discussions but at the same

2152
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,340
time we see a diversification of topics

2153
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,800
so it's no longer just about we would

2154
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,679
say beautiful labor markets no it's also

2155
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,440
about di urbanism it's also about

2156
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,179
co-working space it is also about

2157
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:14,760
Guerilla gardening about co-housing or

2158
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,380
about artistic interventions in public

2159
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,420
space it's also about squatting it's

2160
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,760
also about self-built housing and the

2161
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,100
list is endless yeah all these kinds of

2162
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,960
practices of course each but they're all

2163
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,360
with their own and I see approaches and

2164
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,280
styles you see all these kinds of

2165
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,679
practice being

2166
01:23:30,679 --> 01:23:34,080
labeled as expressions of informal

2167
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,340
urbanism

2168
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,739
there's a legitimate question to ask how

2169
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:40,140
useful such a slippery term is but it

2170
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,760
has certainly led to a broadening of

2171
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,380
empirical interests

2172
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:45,780
as already mentioned before I think the

2173
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:48,420
the term informal has really helped to

2174
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:50,820
move Beyond a global South versus global

2175
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,100
North studies on cities and to really

2176
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,020
look at the informal urbanism AS Global

2177
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:57,659
urbanism where the informal in a way has

2178
01:23:57,659 --> 01:23:59,760
become foundational to our understanding

2179
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,620
of cities at Large

2180
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,020
uh and the last point I'll skip uh for

2181
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:06,600
now is less essential

2182
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,420
okay I need a sip of water

2183
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,000
um questions please or or comments or

2184
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,640
additions uh on this on this part

2185
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:20,900
if any

2186
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,719
um maybe I could ask a question about

2187
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:30,360
um let's say these structures these

2188
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,980
infrastructures growing in the shadow of

2189
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,020
the state as you have mentioned it so we

2190
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:35,340
noticed that

2191
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,080
um actually a lot of communes in

2192
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:40,860
Brussels are trying to set themselves on

2193
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:44,100
the let's say cultural map and we are

2194
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,840
working in urban analysis on the

2195
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,060
community Forge that has its own like a

2196
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:50,280
very active plan and wants to be a

2197
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,500
leader and a new place for art and

2198
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,199
culture in Brussels yes I wonder what

2199
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,739
your take on that was also working with

2200
01:24:58,739 --> 01:25:00,659
um with the association that you

2201
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:02,040
mentioned you must be seeing also a

2202
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,739
different side of of the the influence

2203
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:08,460
of of local yeah local government in

2204
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:11,600
Brussels on that yeah exactly yeah

2205
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,460
I mean I mean asking a question about a

2206
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:15,960
city in which which I live of course is

2207
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,040
always difficult because I can talk

2208
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,320
about this for hours but

2209
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:19,980
um

2210
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,320
it's a tricky I mean I would say for

2211
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,780
that to a large extent has become a a

2212
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:27,060
creative or cultural hub for artists

2213
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,940
which is really which it obviously is uh

2214
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:33,420
despite for a municipality uh as as

2215
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,980
often happens in Russell is not because

2216
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,739
of the government that we see uh

2217
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:39,480
interesting activity happening somewhere

2218
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:42,480
Russell is a city that really relies a

2219
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,980
thing on on strong let's say um uh well

2220
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,560
social movements and citizen activity uh

2221
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,820
and this also applies a thing to

2222
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:53,340
Artistic activity in Forever have you

2223
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:54,840
said that what of course what you now

2224
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,659
see happening is that because for the uh

2225
01:25:57,659 --> 01:26:00,780
it has become let's see uh let's say a

2226
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,300
concentration uh let's say for for

2227
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:06,060
artists uh we do see of course that

2228
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:07,800
local municipality is increasingly also

2229
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,320
using this to in a way to to to to Brand

2230
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,199
itself right to to uh as such there is

2231
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:14,699
nothing wrong with this

2232
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:17,280
uh I mean I don't live in Florida we

2233
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,840
need to look into a very specific local

2234
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,460
details at the same time I don't have

2235
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:21,620
the feeling

2236
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:25,320
that they have a strong strategic

2237
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,860
perspective and for that on the role of

2238
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,360
of arts and culture in their

2239
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,420
municipality so it doesn't and that's

2240
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:35,100
apply this applies to process as a whole

2241
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:37,440
I think it doesn't get to my knowledge

2242
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:41,100
move Beyond a kind of offering of

2243
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:44,219
temporary interim use spaces for artists

2244
01:26:44,219 --> 01:26:46,260
so there doesn't yet seem to be a kind

2245
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,659
of broader let's say more substantial

2246
01:26:48,659 --> 01:26:50,280
perspective on this but maybe you

2247
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,719
already know more about this through the

2248
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:53,760
urban analysis and and the work that

2249
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,600
you've done so far

2250
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,639
I think we we definitely see a lot of

2251
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:02,580
policy claims for sure and a lot of use

2252
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,540
of it

2253
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:05,760
um so now indeed it's a next challenge

2254
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,980
to look into how that actually plays out

2255
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:10,199
on the ground and whether that actually

2256
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:11,639
translates into action but thank you for

2257
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:14,960
your reaction yes okay thank you

2258
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,639
a comment as well

2259
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:21,300
um last year I did uh literature study

2260
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:24,239
about gentrification in Brussels yeah

2261
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,179
especially in the region of um

2262
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:29,280
since molenberg

2263
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,620
and we saw

2264
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,780
um in the 80s there come a lot of

2265
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,179
artists start living there

2266
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:39,239
so it became very popular to to live

2267
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:42,659
there and the results was poor people

2268
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:45,239
poor people need to move out

2269
01:27:45,239 --> 01:27:48,540
so I guess there is always

2270
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:53,639
a small dark sites of this one let's do

2271
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:55,500
gentle Creations especially in in

2272
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,199
Brussels yeah yeah I mean I can only say

2273
01:27:58,199 --> 01:28:01,400
I showed yes to that

2274
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,080
um yeah I mean I mean I mean there's

2275
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,520
there are different opinions on

2276
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,860
gentrification and Brussels I mean some

2277
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:09,600
would say well there's clear

2278
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,400
gentrification and B and there's there's

2279
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,260
expulsion

2280
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,159
um

2281
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,380
if you look at the numbers that my the

2282
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,060
actual expulsion of people from a

2283
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,620
certain localities might be limited

2284
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:21,480
still but it's clear that certain

2285
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,120
certain areas are changing rapidly

2286
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,620
um one of the things we're trying to do

2287
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:26,940
which for example the permanent project

2288
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:29,159
I'm permanent project I mentioned is to

2289
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:30,900
also think about spatial because one of

2290
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,760
the problems is let's say artists move

2291
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,159
into certain spaces they're looking for

2292
01:28:35,159 --> 01:28:37,980
let's say work and Living Spaces but in

2293
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,199
a way unintendedly so data and actually

2294
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:42,900
lead to a push out effect for other uh

2295
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,120
for adolescent poor poor citizens in

2296
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,800
most cases

2297
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,960
at the same time it's not as if artists

2298
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,639
are belong let's say to an urban Elite

2299
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:51,719
in general

2300
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:54,780
so one is on a very small level what

2301
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:55,860
we're trying to do with the permanent

2302
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:57,840
project is also try to think of let's

2303
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,360
say spaces that are that are co-owned

2304
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,480
and where let's say the the move of

2305
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,699
artists into a certain area does not

2306
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:07,260
automatically translate into the move

2307
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:11,280
out of other citizens uh

2308
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,199
realistically speaking of course my

2309
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,320
position on this is that

2310
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,940
this can only partially be solved on the

2311
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:19,739
project level because practically

2312
01:29:19,739 --> 01:29:21,000
speaking you simply need more social

2313
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
housing for this and muscles is is a

2314
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,440
disastrous City when it comes to

2315
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,380
percentage of social housing let alone

2316
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:30,060
qualitative social housing we're really

2317
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:31,820
talking about a few percentages

2318
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:35,219
uh of the total housing stock which is

2319
01:29:35,219 --> 01:29:37,020
social housing which is completely

2320
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:38,760
different for example in a city such as

2321
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,500
such as Amsterdam which has also seen

2322
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,780
gentrification obviously but that's the

2323
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,880
social housing stock definitely helps

2324
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,159
there which all is all is its own

2325
01:29:47,159 --> 01:29:51,920
complexities and problems so yeah

2326
01:29:53,219 --> 01:29:56,540
any other comments

2327
01:29:57,739 --> 01:30:01,440
no okay then I'll move to the like the

2328
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,080
last section I think of the

2329
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,179
of the the the session I think we're

2330
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:08,040
more or less okay on time

2331
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,679
which is good so I I what I did I

2332
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:12,060
promised last week that I would also

2333
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,100
have a separate section on tourism I

2334
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,280
don't so I didn't manage to fit it in

2335
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,080
and uh it's it's picked up in some of

2336
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,540
these elements implicitly I think so

2337
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,219
um I'm also less of an expert on Urban

2338
01:30:23,219 --> 01:30:24,960
tourism I know the literature quite well

2339
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,159
but it's not something that I do

2340
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,560
research on myself uh but this is

2341
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,060
certainly also a let's see another

2342
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,280
strand of research which would be is

2343
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,900
interesting from an urban cultural

2344
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,420
perspective

2345
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:37,860
however the last strand I want to

2346
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:39,780
discuss with you today is is literature

2347
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,520
which is perhaps more closely related to

2348
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,380
the humanities than some other elements

2349
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:46,320
I that I that I discussed with you today

2350
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,320
um which I flag here as the research on

2351
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,840
sensory urbanism visual cultures or

2352
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,400
sensory urbanism and then two examples

2353
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,460
visual cultures and sounds

2354
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,620
um the Brian largest text that was on

2355
01:30:58,620 --> 01:30:59,699
your reading for today already

2356
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:01,440
highlighted I think how media

2357
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,139
Technologies and Aesthetics shape Urban

2358
01:31:04,139 --> 01:31:06,600
places so this idea that actually by

2359
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,800
building certain distribution

2360
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,719
infrastructures by having certain places

2361
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:12,300
you actually shape Urban places through

2362
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,920
through these Technologies and

2363
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,380
Aesthetics in turn and this you could

2364
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:18,380
see is let's say the more experiential

2365
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:20,940
phenomenological or or user point of

2366
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,280
view this implies also that places are

2367
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,280
experienced through multiple senses

2368
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,840
seeing listening smelling touching

2369
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,480
tasting now historically most research

2370
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,940
has focused on the visual Dimension but

2371
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:34,739
increasingly we also see it and this has

2372
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,360
a long long history I'll give a few

2373
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,040
simple examples in a minute

2374
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,600
but increasingly you also see the

2375
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,120
attention paid to other sciences and

2376
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,679
I'll briefly discuss tourists to

2377
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,719
research which I think is pretty

2378
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:47,159
interesting but obviously I'm biased

2379
01:31:47,159 --> 01:31:50,400
because I I tend to like mostly or Focus

2380
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,760
mostly on on Music and Sound myself

2381
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,340
um but I'll briefly discuss uh some of

2382
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,719
the research on let's see auditory

2383
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:00,360
culture Sonic cultures or Music and

2384
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:02,600
Sound

2385
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:05,040
now to start with the visual ecology

2386
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,440
spots so remember Jameson so this is

2387
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,780
let's say the the the hotel that was

2388
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,120
already discussed uh in the in the

2389
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,060
Jameson text 1984. basically you could

2390
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,800
say one element of if not star

2391
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,900
architecture but at least let's see very

2392
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:21,000
sort of in your face uh phase

2393
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,880
architecture and within Urban studies a

2394
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,620
lot of attention has been paid to this

2395
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,420
kind of architecture so basically

2396
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:29,280
buildings designed to leave a strong

2397
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,320
visual impression because that is what

2398
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:32,940
these buildings do and what they aim to

2399
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:35,400
do now the analytical Focus starting

2400
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,340
already in the 1980s some elements have

2401
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:40,320
let's say survived the years others have

2402
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,900
not has been on cognitive disorientation

2403
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,480
but also on Landmark statements in a

2404
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,520
city with an emphasis on spectacle and

2405
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,080
surveillance with emphasis and

2406
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,659
consumption Landscapes and an emphasis

2407
01:32:51,659 --> 01:32:53,639
on representation and Global

2408
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:55,920
attractiveness so this is all you see

2409
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,199
well rehearsed territory within Urban

2410
01:32:58,199 --> 01:33:01,199
studies and which has a long history of

2411
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:04,920
of analysis now star architecture you

2412
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:08,580
literally adds value to world cities or

2413
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:10,679
aspiring world cities so the

2414
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:12,239
architecture becomes you could say an

2415
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:15,360
urban icon in global rankings it really

2416
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,860
helps and years there is a tourism

2417
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:19,440
reference it really helps to put world

2418
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,360
cities on the map for tourism and

2419
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,860
consumption purposes

2420
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:25,560
uh these sites or or the surrounding

2421
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,820
areas become size for business

2422
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:29,520
Investments uh or also for up Market

2423
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,500
residential housing so they literally

2424
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,560
add value to aspiring the world cities

2425
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,639
true you could say strong visual claims

2426
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:40,679
now this has this of course has a

2427
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:42,540
history right this is not we have we

2428
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,639
should not be naiveless historically a

2429
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,679
leaf and pretend that this is something

2430
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:49,440
of let's say the post for this age or

2431
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,880
something that we've only seen since the

2432
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,980
late 20th century although it probably

2433
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:56,100
has increased and probably let's say

2434
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,980
more let's say professional and

2435
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:01,139
strategic attention is now being paid a

2436
01:34:01,139 --> 01:34:02,699
paid to let's say the visual dimension

2437
01:34:02,699 --> 01:34:05,340
of cities compared to the let's say the

2438
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,360
the

2439
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:09,120
the decades before but it has a much

2440
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,219
longer history the most and most obvious

2441
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:12,780
or let's say a classic example of course

2442
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:15,420
being the Eiffel Tower which itself was

2443
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,360
built to put Paris on the map or to make

2444
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,239
it more visual Again part of let's say a

2445
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:23,880
broader broader exhibition setup you

2446
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,500
know originally intended temporary but

2447
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,719
has been there for quite some time and

2448
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:30,480
which now is a classic Landmark case in

2449
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,460
uh or example in oops sorry

2450
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,600
around the world when people think about

2451
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,800
Paris sorry

2452
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,719
or another example

2453
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:43,739
um

2454
01:34:43,739 --> 01:34:45,540
so I'm working with two two computers

2455
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:48,600
here so this is sometimes confusing uh

2456
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,460
another example the Opera housing City

2457
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,440
again an example even if you've never

2458
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,360
visited Sydney you will know this

2459
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,219
building the Opera House in Sydney

2460
01:34:56,219 --> 01:34:59,520
architect you're on utsan uh or another

2461
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,980
example which I think by now also

2462
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:03,719
everyone knows which is perhaps you in a

2463
01:35:03,719 --> 01:35:05,580
way the more recent example the gubernet

2464
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:09,900
museum in Bilbao Spain which in its very

2465
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:14,340
setup uh was intended to leave Legacy a

2466
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:16,920
visual impression and you will see that

2467
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,120
many people visit the Google night

2468
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,580
Museum in Bilbao without seeing anything

2469
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,159
else or any or very little of Bilbao as

2470
01:35:23,159 --> 01:35:26,940
such so I would I would dare to to claim

2471
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:28,739
that the vast majority of people that

2472
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:31,620
visit the Google Museum in Bilbao will

2473
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:33,840
leave the city Without Really knowing

2474
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,540
much about Bilbao yeah I mean there's

2475
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:37,860
not a question if they should be it

2476
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:39,780
should but it's clear that this kind of

2477
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:42,060
a visual attraction plays a key role and

2478
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:43,679
it has played out at the same time in

2479
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,620
almost role in increasing tourism flows

2480
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:48,480
towards Bilbao

2481
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,880
or an even more recent Example The

2482
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,719
Helpful Harmony the Opera House in

2483
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:58,739
Hamburg uh 800 million euros enormously

2484
01:35:58,739 --> 01:36:00,719
over budget which is very typical also

2485
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:03,060
for some a lot of the star architecture

2486
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:05,040
but in general though and not

2487
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,840
surprisingly perhaps also is that many

2488
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,639
of these buildings are cultural

2489
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:10,440
landmarks that both offer you could say

2490
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:12,960
culture and a design space for tourism

2491
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,060
and consumption yeah

2492
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:17,340
so this as I said this is well rehearsed

2493
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:18,719
territory still a lot of interesting

2494
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:20,639
research is being done on this but it's

2495
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:24,780
it's quite established in in the base

2496
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:26,280
I'll give some examples of course that

2497
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,020
leads to all kinds of discussions also

2498
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,400
about

2499
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,260
um who has the biggest tower I won't go

2500
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,940
into sort of the masculine connotations

2501
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,340
of building the world's tall tallest

2502
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,980
building but it's quite obvious here uh

2503
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:40,620
the Burj Khalifa and also I think and

2504
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,659
this is perhaps a shift which is newer

2505
01:36:42,659 --> 01:36:45,120
uh although and also not completely new

2506
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,580
is that especially unless the world

2507
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:49,620
global cities such as New York such as

2508
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,780
London we see a lot of intention being

2509
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:53,340
paid by private developers to very

2510
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,100
up-market elite residential housing yeah

2511
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:59,040
so this is height one uh in in London

2512
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,520
for example

2513
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:05,580
it is interesting also because these

2514
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:06,960
there's some of these space for up

2515
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,940
Market residential housing they are

2516
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:10,620
built to leave a visual impact they are

2517
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,500
built to attract buyers multi buyers but

2518
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,179
let's say the running joke in a way or

2519
01:37:15,179 --> 01:37:16,860
low the sadness of the story in many

2520
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:20,760
ways is that if you look at uh how well

2521
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,620
for which period of the Year these are

2522
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:24,659
Partners or builds are actually occupied

2523
01:37:24,659 --> 01:37:27,300
by actual actual inhabitants is often

2524
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,980
quite limited some of these are just

2525
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:31,860
Apartments to park uh to park like money

2526
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:34,500
but not Nest or do laundry money but not

2527
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,840
necessary to actually live there for for

2528
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,179
a sustainers well substantial period of

2529
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:41,219
the year

2530
01:37:41,219 --> 01:37:43,159
foreign

2531
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:47,580
or another example in New York for 423

2532
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:49,620
Park Avenue

2533
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,960
um perhaps less spectacular but maybe

2534
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,520
intend in a similar Direction at least

2535
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,580
visually speaking uh is this building at

2536
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,040
the in the Canal Zone the upside Tower

2537
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,260
in Brussels but the prices are certainly

2538
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,719
more affordable than what the price you

2539
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:07,620
will see in uh in New York or London

2540
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,600
now what's interesting about this this

2541
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,340
visual cultures especially in sort of

2542
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:14,400
New Media times is that these let's say

2543
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,139
these Landmark statements these are

2544
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:17,699
actual buildings these are buildings

2545
01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:20,159
very much let's say uh very costly

2546
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:24,120
investments in urban space uh but the

2547
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,920
vast majority of people will know these

2548
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,360
buildings they will see these buildings

2549
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,460
through social media and online

2550
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:31,800
magazines or maybe the let's say a

2551
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,320
coffee table book magazines yeah so

2552
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,120
these these buildings play a massive an

2553
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,460
important role in City branding and

2554
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,080
hopefully attracting cultural tourism

2555
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,600
and also in circulating on social media

2556
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,699
so you've got images such as this where

2557
01:38:44,699 --> 01:38:46,139
sort of if you look at Instagram and

2558
01:38:46,139 --> 01:38:48,120
search for Star architecture or

2559
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,480
spectacular architecture you will see

2560
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:53,580
loads of images or even let's say New

2561
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:57,060
York using using uh using let's say

2562
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:59,340
certain space or new builds in New York

2563
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,800
and labeling it as best Instagram spots

2564
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,659
and then you get these uh this

2565
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:05,100
interesting uh let's say tourism

2566
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,440
basically photograph themselves with the

2567
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,600
building in the background as a candles

2568
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,679
let's say

2569
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:13,320
uh I've been there kind of attitudes but

2570
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,239
it's quite obvious where sort of the the

2571
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:17,340
spectacular Arctic plays a key role not

2572
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:19,560
in relation to questions actual use but

2573
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,300
largely in regression in relation to

2574
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,460
questions of representation and how can

2575
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:25,980
you actually uh how do how well do these

2576
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:28,260
images look like on Instagram or other

2577
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,860
websites

2578
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:35,880
now this is empirically this is

2579
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,340
interesting he's a new phenomena with

2580
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:39,780
longer histories but empirically

2581
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:41,880
interesting theoretically it raises

2582
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,260
certain questions about how we should

2583
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:46,320
look like how we should look at at city

2584
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,000
development and how we should look at

2585
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,719
how cities uh change over time this ties

2586
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:53,280
then I would argue with a literature on

2587
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,960
what is sometimes called geographies of

2588
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,120
circulation where we really try to

2589
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,400
understand City cultures as an effect of

2590
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,920
circulation so not necessarily designed

2591
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,900
locally but actually images traveling

2592
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:06,360
between cities of course also traveling

2593
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,639
of Architects and other experts but also

2594
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:11,639
Concepts images plans best practices so

2595
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:13,739
my Urban culture as such perhaps also

2596
01:40:13,739 --> 01:40:15,900
Urban policy as such becomes a kind of

2597
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,000
practice of inter-inter referencing so

2598
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,580
cities referencing each other or

2599
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:22,860
buildings referencing each other to to

2600
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:25,020
to to to to stake out a claim so to

2601
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:25,679
speak

2602
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,500
now all this leaves back in my view

2603
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,120
although not always recognized as such

2604
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,159
with the Innovative nervous studies do

2605
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,840
classic cultural studies concerns with

2606
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,480
the politics of representation but also

2607
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,040
to an anthropological interest and

2608
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,320
there's a very nice book an article also

2609
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,440
by Ayana already from the late 1980s on

2610
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,719
the social life of objects so how do

2611
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:49,080
objects travel through space and Through

2612
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:51,380
Time

2613
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,320
okay

2614
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,239
last section for today because this as I

2615
01:40:57,239 --> 01:40:58,980
said is it's well well throttling Theory

2616
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:00,719
within Urban studies to really look at

2617
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:03,540
sort of the visual in relation to to the

2618
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:04,739
urban

2619
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:07,260
but especially uh yeah the last 10 20

2620
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:08,820
years I guess we see an increasing

2621
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,739
interest also in other sciences and the

2622
01:41:10,739 --> 01:41:12,900
urban the example I briefly want to

2623
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,639
discuss with you today as a closure for

2624
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:17,760
the lecture uh isn't it is um research

2625
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,380
and auditory Sonic cultures the

2626
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,840
vocabulary tends to differ

2627
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,820
um there's a lot of interesting work

2628
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:26,040
being done on this still sometimes also

2629
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,139
by practicing uh practicing artists

2630
01:41:28,139 --> 01:41:30,179
practicing musicians that also writes

2631
01:41:30,179 --> 01:41:32,820
such as for example Brandon LaBelle who

2632
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,619
wrote quite a nice book on acoustic

2633
01:41:34,619 --> 01:41:36,300
territories sound culture and everyday

2634
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,239
life so you see again everyday life

2635
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:43,199
returning as a as a as vocabulary so in

2636
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:45,420
chapter 3 for example which is the some

2637
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:47,880
of the examples I use here where you

2638
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,800
explicitly bills on micheliness of those

2639
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,840
the practice of everyday life a very

2640
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,080
develop the view on walking not an in a

2641
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,239
visual way as actually the setode did

2642
01:41:57,239 --> 01:41:58,679
because he had a lot of discussions to

2643
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:00,540
do about how you look in relation to

2644
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:01,980
building how you position yourself in

2645
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:04,139
relation to the city but a very develops

2646
01:42:04,139 --> 01:42:06,360
with you and walk through an auditory or

2647
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:09,000
rhythmic perspectives and then he gives

2648
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,920
all kinds of examples such as crosswalk

2649
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:13,560
signals warning warning alarms or

2650
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,360
personal audio so looking listening on

2651
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,860
your smartphone to music while walking

2652
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:18,719
through the city but also for example

2653
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,300
sound art or marching bands or protests

2654
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,760
and they're all sound plays and let's

2655
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,940
say experiencing and and structuring uh

2656
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:30,239
let's say city city life

2657
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,219
he gives the example for example of

2658
01:42:32,219 --> 01:42:35,400
floriano jumano and fallante Sao Paulo I

2659
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,719
think he actually mentions as Rio

2660
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,840
dictionary but I think it's in Sao Paulo

2661
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,900
um we walked around uh with with a big

2662
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:46,860
speaker on us on his back uh which

2663
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:47,880
basically

2664
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,639
um where the voice is speaking out loud

2665
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,260
don't don't something like don't pay

2666
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:54,600
attention if I remember correctly so he

2667
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,100
was walking around the streets in public

2668
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:58,260
space don't pay attention don't pay

2669
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:00,420
attention don't pay attention which

2670
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:02,400
obviously the exact opposite will then

2671
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,119
happen which is a pretty nice or neat uh

2672
01:43:06,119 --> 01:43:08,460
intervention I think in in public space

2673
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:12,119
as a kind of art project

2674
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:14,580
another example is okay is that that we

2675
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:16,679
have active networks this is a much

2676
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:18,659
longer history also of field recorders

2677
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:20,639
people doing field recordings but

2678
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:22,320
there's a very nice website for those

2679
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,960
that are that are into this stuff uh

2680
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,880
which uh it's called sound cities just

2681
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,219
Google it you'll find it which has

2682
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:31,380
connected let's say field records from

2683
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:33,659
cities across the world where you can

2684
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:35,280
actually play well this has been mapped

2685
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,380
literally on the map of these cities and

2686
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:39,360
where you can play Let's see sounds from

2687
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,739
these cities or from these particular

2688
01:43:40,739 --> 01:43:43,260
locations in these cities uh and that's

2689
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,119
that's an ever-growing database but

2690
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,219
there's also active community of sound

2691
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:49,980
recorders field recorders recording

2692
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,960
sounds are cities and it's quite nice if

2693
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,060
you have a bit of time to let's say to

2694
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:55,800
go through some of the sounds and also

2695
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,560
experience some of the let's say

2696
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,880
differences and sounds uh between

2697
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:03,020
between different cities

2698
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:06,300
one example I want to just briefly play

2699
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:08,460
and I hope this all works with uh with

2700
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:09,659
sounds I'm just going to play it and

2701
01:44:09,659 --> 01:44:10,860
then you're gonna have to tell me if you

2702
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:12,659
hear the sound so turn on do turn on the

2703
01:44:12,659 --> 01:44:15,540
sounds uh is a very nice piece I think

2704
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,760
by Felix bloom a Mexican artist simaphor

2705
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,820
was so normal from Mexico City 2015.

2706
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:22,739
very

2707
01:44:22,739 --> 01:44:25,020
um basically manipulated the walking

2708
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:27,780
signals uh of

2709
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:30,000
um on the street in um

2710
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,699
uh in Mexico City and when we replace

2711
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:34,679
the sound of a pedestrian traffic light

2712
01:44:34,679 --> 01:44:36,659
with the sound uh with like let's say

2713
01:44:36,659 --> 01:44:38,400
the classic sound with the sound of a

2714
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,400
donkey uh which according to him is a

2715
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,860
nice way of of well paying attention to

2716
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:46,440
well first of all making people think

2717
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:48,060
differently look differently wait this

2718
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:49,500
is something else than I expected so

2719
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,900
it's a kind of intervention but also a

2720
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,460
bit directing attention to an animal

2721
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:55,260
which is largely disappeared from Mexico

2722
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:58,800
City uh says this Urban space which uh

2723
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,199
which uh was different let's say 30 40

2724
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:03,719
50 years ago so I'm just gonna look if

2725
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:04,980
this works and you're gonna have to tell

2726
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:07,560
me just do it like this or something if

2727
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,520
the sound is okay

2728
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,480
do you hear sounds

2729
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:19,340
okay perfect now please play

2730
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:44,250
[Music]

2731
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:58,699
[Music]

2732
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:08,300
foreign

2733
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:23,770
[Music]

2734
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:33,780
okay so just one one small example which

2735
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:36,659
I thought is a pretty pretty nice

2736
01:46:36,659 --> 01:46:37,260
um

2737
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:40,199
nice intervention with a lot of humor uh

2738
01:46:40,199 --> 01:46:42,179
Felix Bloom also did quite he's done a

2739
01:46:42,179 --> 01:46:43,679
lot of work as a sound artist he also

2740
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,480
did quite some interesting work and this

2741
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:47,520
is a kind of early work you could argue

2742
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,159
but where later on he actually worked in

2743
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:52,980
collaboration with blind people uh to

2744
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,960
actually and and use let's say sounds

2745
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,239
and their experience of urban space in

2746
01:46:57,239 --> 01:46:59,340
order to sort of make make artistic uh

2747
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:00,900
well it's artistic projects which is

2748
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:02,699
also some interesting work to just check

2749
01:47:02,699 --> 01:47:04,980
his website if you're interested in this

2750
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:07,139
kind of stuff

2751
01:47:07,139 --> 01:47:09,540
this example I'll move to the very end

2752
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:12,659
which is a nice example by the way of

2753
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:14,820
of sound and protests and there are many

2754
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:17,960
examples of this following the 2011

2755
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,940
Fukushima Fukushima nuclear accident in

2756
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:24,420
Japan Japan saw actually a wide range of

2757
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,440
public protests here's one example which

2758
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,440
was a sound demo organized by a loose

2759
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,360
association called shirota noiran

2760
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,940
amateur revolt

2761
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:37,500
and the organized a kind of sound demo

2762
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,179
protest which is pretty neat if you like

2763
01:47:39,179 --> 01:47:41,760
noise which I do but since it's a 10

2764
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,679
minute video I will

2765
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:48,540
leave this for the very end and close my

2766
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:50,159
sorry that one that will come in a

2767
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:51,020
second

2768
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:53,760
and move to my conclusions

2769
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,860
before I do so are there any questions

2770
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:59,699
on the um on the section on sensory

2771
01:47:59,699 --> 01:48:02,239
urbanism

2772
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,600
and I know it's almost 8 PM so I know

2773
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,100
it's late

2774
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:10,080
yeah just just unmute yourself and start

2775
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,280
talking because I don't see anyone

2776
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,619
everyone in my screen okay I would just

2777
01:48:13,619 --> 01:48:16,800
like to share with with you and with

2778
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,080
whom can be interested about the project

2779
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:23,900
of um sound of tourist tourism

2780
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:27,659
Lisbon he mapped the the sound of

2781
01:48:27,659 --> 01:48:29,219
tourism in the city and it's pretty

2782
01:48:29,219 --> 01:48:31,760
interesting

2783
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,260
I didn't know it yet so I'll check it

2784
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:37,800
out very cool yeah okay thanks

2785
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:40,199
other comments suggestions

2786
01:48:40,199 --> 01:48:42,420
interventions

2787
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:44,400
no

2788
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,440
I will wrap up then with the conclusions

2789
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:48,540
and then after the conclusions I will

2790
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:51,300
move to the to the Tokyo video but

2791
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:52,920
there's obviously no obligation to sit

2792
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,719
through 12 minutes of noise so I'll just

2793
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:56,340
leave it play for those that are

2794
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:59,219
interested uh but I will conclude uh and

2795
01:48:59,219 --> 01:49:01,920
say bye after the after the conclusions

2796
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:05,940
okay to wrap up this uh this relatively

2797
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,800
intense session I think around the

2798
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,540
different strands of research on on

2799
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,600
Urban culture what I tried to get across

2800
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,760
is that research and urban cultures is a

2801
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:16,619
thriving and more perhaps more

2802
01:49:16,619 --> 01:49:18,300
importantly or very all equally

2803
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:19,920
importantly and into a transdisciplinary

2804
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,960
field of research it's increasingly

2805
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,280
difficult to distinguish between

2806
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,260
disciplines in research and urban

2807
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:28,260
cultures which perhaps is a trend that

2808
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:31,380
applies to all teams you could say but I

2809
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:32,580
definitely think it applies more

2810
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:34,920
strongly to research and urban culture

2811
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:37,679
building on 1980s 1990s debate on the

2812
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:39,900
cultural term uh post-modernism and

2813
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:42,239
urban uh and the symbolic economy and

2814
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:43,199
through interaction with Urban

2815
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:44,699
anthropology and cultural studies

2816
01:49:44,699 --> 01:49:46,139
particularly through Notions such as

2817
01:49:46,139 --> 01:49:48,000
informal informality informal urbanism

2818
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,159
everyday life what we see is that Urban

2819
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:51,780
studies is really Diversified into

2820
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:53,699
multiple strands of research dedicated

2821
01:49:53,699 --> 01:49:56,460
to cultural issues it's important to

2822
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,380
make distinctions here because different

2823
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:00,119
strands have different artists have

2824
01:50:00,119 --> 01:50:02,520
different communities of practice but I

2825
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,719
would say there are three different

2826
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:06,360
strands that that that are most

2827
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,040
interesting but they pretty much do

2828
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:09,179
cover it and they're not the only

2829
01:50:09,179 --> 01:50:11,639
strands but I do think they cover uh

2830
01:50:11,639 --> 01:50:14,280
let's say 80 of of the urban studies

2831
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,219
research on Urban culture perhaps with

2832
01:50:17,219 --> 01:50:18,659
the exception of urban tourism and

2833
01:50:18,659 --> 01:50:20,460
cultural issues which I didn't discuss

2834
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:22,920
in detail today the first one being the

2835
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:25,320
Arts activism and urban engagement the

2836
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,760
second cultural infrastructure the

2837
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:28,619
informal urbanism and the third strand

2838
01:50:28,619 --> 01:50:31,020
around sensory urbanism where I give

2839
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:34,139
very briefly two examples on visual

2840
01:50:34,139 --> 01:50:36,119
cultures and sounds

2841
01:50:36,119 --> 01:50:39,780
that's it from my site for today

2842
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:41,480
um if there are no further questions

2843
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:45,780
then I will move back to the uh to this

2844
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:49,020
presentation sorry to this video

2845
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:52,080
um I have one quick question

2846
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,300
um are there any connections between

2847
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:57,239
um Sansui urbanism and clubbing culture

2848
01:50:57,239 --> 01:50:59,400
for instance

2849
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,380
um

2850
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:03,600
limited limited I think it's in the

2851
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,820
research is limited I think the clubbing

2852
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:08,040
culture literature as far as I know it

2853
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,600
is last year literature that builds on

2854
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,219
the LA City Classic cultural studies

2855
01:51:11,219 --> 01:51:12,119
tradition

2856
01:51:12,119 --> 01:51:14,159
focusing on let's say youth culture

2857
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:16,679
popular culture uh sociological

2858
01:51:16,679 --> 01:51:18,600
approaches by and large

2859
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:21,840
however it's if you look at let's say

2860
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,179
practitioners in clubbing culture

2861
01:51:24,179 --> 01:51:25,679
then I think there are stronger

2862
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,840
connections especially those working in

2863
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:31,199
let's say electronic music moving let's

2864
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,659
say from a minimal techno orientation

2865
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:35,940
who have increasingly moved into let's

2866
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:39,360
say modern composition and or indeed

2867
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,580
field work type Fields field recordings

2868
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:44,699
type of work there you will see

2869
01:51:44,699 --> 01:51:45,420
um

2870
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:47,880
artist who

2871
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,639
um well who who sort of transcend the

2872
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:51,840
boundaries who connect these things

2873
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,940
because they then become you could say

2874
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,800
sensory urbanists through their practice

2875
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:58,139
but in the research I would say less so

2876
01:51:58,139 --> 01:51:59,760
they think they seem to be quite

2877
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,800
separate well they are to a large extent

2878
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:03,420
quite separate fields

2879
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:05,280
but which doesn't mean that the

2880
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:06,840
connection cannot be made so that may be

2881
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,780
done your job yeah

2882
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:12,480
well I'm thinking uh

2883
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:15,540
I have one example in mind

2884
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:18,380
um of Tbilisi in Georgia

2885
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:21,960
where last year there were very big

2886
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,820
protests I have to say I really don't

2887
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:25,199
know the details about it but I know

2888
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:26,780
there was also

2889
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:32,040
uh some substantial mobilization from uh

2890
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:36,560
clubs and from people from artists and

2891
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:39,980
people from that scene um

2892
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:42,840
and you saw some sort of a collaboration

2893
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,280
between

2894
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:46,679
yeah these these people from club

2895
01:52:46,679 --> 01:52:48,300
culture so to say and more political

2896
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:51,060
movements and also using music in public

2897
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:54,300
space as a form of protest yeah no that

2898
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,280
that happens of course and I think in in

2899
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:58,260
the Berlin example I used before I think

2900
01:52:58,260 --> 01:52:59,760
you also see these examples of public

2901
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,360
protest and uh and music I mean the the

2902
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,580
classic example of the love love parade

2903
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,199
started out you could say as a political

2904
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,659
movement even though I would argue it's

2905
01:53:09,659 --> 01:53:11,880
that it was heavily commodified soon

2906
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:14,639
after or increasingly so

2907
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:16,739
um but the sensory urbanism literature

2908
01:53:16,739 --> 01:53:18,300
perhaps relates more you could say to

2909
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,219
the experimental sites and to the sound

2910
01:53:20,219 --> 01:53:22,500
not not even necessarily music and

2911
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:24,119
that's a different kind of scene I would

2912
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:26,699
argue and although there is overlap

2913
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:28,380
obviously so yeah

2914
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:32,219
yeah thank you any other comments

2915
01:53:32,219 --> 01:53:33,719
questions

2916
01:53:33,719 --> 01:53:35,760
perhaps just a very practical question

2917
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,159
uh for me regarding the seminars that

2918
01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:41,159
will follow uh in the coming weeks and I

2919
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:42,900
wonder how

2920
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:46,080
um the presentations will will go

2921
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:48,300
I asked because we were asked in the

2922
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:49,619
past to record the video of our

2923
01:53:49,619 --> 01:53:51,239
presentation and I wondered if you

2924
01:53:51,239 --> 01:53:53,280
wanted the same or if we will give that

2925
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:55,020
in person yes the rule would be would

2926
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:56,340
remain the same I think that's how it's

2927
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:57,960
the most communicated also so I would

2928
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:59,219
actually need to look into the details

2929
