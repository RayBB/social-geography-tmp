1
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,980
thank you

2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,600
all right

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,879
welcome everybody

4
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,320
to

5
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,379
urban geography Urban social geography I

6
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,020
had to work a little bit to make the

7
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,219
live stream work I hope it does work

8
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,600
does anybody mind if I take off my mask

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,099
is that okay

10
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,979
if anybody's uncomfortable just let me

11
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:08,760
know

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,540
but I rely on my facial expressions

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,140
for Content uh how do you say that to

14
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,659
transfer content if you will

15
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,000
um so hi I'm David uh I'll be your

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,140
lecturer

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,439
and welcome to the course

18
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,140
um I'm very glad that we can

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,680
teach and have this uh in real life in

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,420
person

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,060
um I'll tell you more about

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,740
um the kind of hybrid character because

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,259
we'll also be recording the sessions and

24
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,360
live streaming this session

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,720
so I think the pandemic pandemic

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,680
conditions are still ongoing to allow if

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
you would doubt about any infection Etc

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,700
to follow the course remotely

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,119
uh I think this can be more evident I

30
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,100
think for the for the regular lectures

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,560
like we have today

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
um there's also a number of discussion

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,340
seminars there it will be a bit less

34
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,739
evident uh and there's also excursions

35
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,819
for some in there yeah I mean uh I can't

36
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,340
stream an Excursion uh but for the

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,840
lectures it will be an alternative and

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,080
you also have a recording at the end

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,660
um of the lecture series and this could

40
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,900
be an interesting instrument to study

41
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,300
um so yeah that's also how students have

42
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,640
used it last year

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,540
okay so what are the objectives of the

44
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,819
entire course urban geography or Urban

45
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,400
social geography well just summed up

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,300
there

47
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,300
I won't go too to deep into this uh just

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,519
here and now but just that you know what

49
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,580
you're signing up for uh for the people

50
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,040
that are still uh shopping around I

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,660
would say

52
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,400
um the objective of the course is to

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,379
give an introduction to key theoretical

54
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,019
debates in urban studies more

55
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,379
specifically uh focusing on spatial and

56
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,860
geographical dimensions hence it's not

57
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,420
um introduction to Urban studies but

58
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,780
introduction to Urban Geography

59
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,260
and and this is kind of uh kind of

60
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,940
signaling what we find important as

61
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,019
lecturers

62
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,780
to adopt a theoretically pluralist

63
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,180
approach toward Urban studies

64
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,400
you'll see that and I'll get to that in

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,720
a second that we work with different

66
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,480
teachers lectures we all have their own

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
backgrounds and they may be slightly

68
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,019
different some people work more on a

69
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,060
political economy perspective others

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,239
start from adopting a perspective from

71
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,060
diversity ethnicity yet others are

72
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,739
interested in

73
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,220
uh issues of culture then the broad

74
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,680
sense and others work in a kind of

75
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,540
Mobility framework and we'll try to

76
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,540
bring those things together in one

77
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,060
course but what is kind of uniting the

78
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,860
course that I think a spatial social

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,560
spatial understanding of contemporary

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,620
cities okay so that's what you're

81
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,840
signing up for if you hate cities this

82
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,840
is the moment to leave the room

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,620
um I Told You So So This Is The Old Mill

84
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,120
panel

85
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,940
um that we present you my sincerest

86
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,260
apologies

87
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,899
um but I think that hopefully diversity

88
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,180
across the curriculum is a bit better

89
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,120
than within this course but

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,540
um we're selecting from the people that

91
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,900
that can teach so please accept my

92
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,820
apologies for that but still we hope

93
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,600
that we can inform you from a range of

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,759
perspectives uh also including I would

95
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,220
say feminist perspectives and they will

96
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,979
pop up here and there

97
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,320
especially when we start talking about

98
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,080
issues of culture and issues of mobility

99
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,520
and transmit but you see those

100
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Dimensions returning so who is part of

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,160
the teaching team well that's next few

102
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,360
months he's an expert in issues of

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,580
segregation and living in diversity both

104
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,860
from her

105
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,240
he is an expert you could say in

106
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,400
Creative Industries cultural geographies

107
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,220
of the cities of the city boytech

108
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,500
goblovsky

109
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,320
he wrote a PhD on fairfree public

110
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,620
transportation and he's an expert in

111
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,740
urban studies slash transportation

112
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,800
geographies and recently is really

113
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,220
pushing for kind of the colonial

114
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,560
agenda in transport geographies and

115
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,419
finally there's me

116
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,520
um I Won't Say I'm an expert in anything

117
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,680
I'm an expert in coordinating this

118
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,620
course by now uh and I come from a

119
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,380
background of world and Global cities so

120
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,479
what happens to cities amid

121
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,139
globalization uh how should we study

122
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,759
that analyze that well on the main

123
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,780
debates

124
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,360
and personally I've been looking a lot

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,020
into the geographies of Islamic Finance

126
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,660
as a way to understand I would say

127
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,600
Middle Eastern processes of urbanization

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,780
but that was my PhD currently I'm more

129
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,400
working in teams around Financial

130
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,060
geographies more widely thinking about

131
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,699
what typifies Global cities as command

132
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,680
and control centers all kind of things

133
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,840
that I'll be killing you with in the

134
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,120
next few sessions so I won't say

135
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,280
anything more about that so that's the

136
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,720
teaching team

137
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,400
and so this plural voices to some extent

138
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,000
and also there's also a plural audience

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,660
um so I was already referring to groups

140
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,120
of students uh by pointing to that this

141
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,160
is the urban social geography course but

142
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,720
also it's also the urban geography

143
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,060
Course and there are slight differences

144
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,759
between both courses but especially for

145
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,000
uh the lectures that makes complete

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,960
sense

147
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,300
um to to bring you together in a room so

148
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,120
we have the master in urban studies they

149
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,759
will be a master please raise your hands

150
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,280
and voices

151
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,000
okay thanks for the hands

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,340
uh this for citizens

153
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,940
yeah so that's even more exotic these

154
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,800
people travel around Europe in the next

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
two years

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
uh then we have our own exotic species

157
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,080
uh from The Bachelor of geography uh

158
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,660
maybe raise your hand

159
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,780
welcome and we also have

160
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,120
um urbanists in the room

161
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,720
um so please show me where you are these

162
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,639
people also combine this with with an

163
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,259
actual job uh so that's also why we

164
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,139
teach at night to accommodate that and

165
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,460
these are people that have quite a bit

166
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,800
of professional expertise so I would say

167
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,280
this is already a global Urban map here

168
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,460
uh confined in this room

169
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,940
um I would say enjoy this mix and try to

170
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,460
pick each other's brains as much as

171
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,620
possible I think just by comparing Urban

172
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,300
experiences

173
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,639
Supreme casual conversation you can

174
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
already learn quite a bit I would say

175
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
so similarities

176
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,419
um

177
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,620
all students have lectures and

178
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,080
discussion seminars this discussion

179
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,360
seminar for capacity reasons will be

180
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,699
split but I'll tell you more about that

181
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,580
for urban social geographers so that's

182
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,199
what mass and urban studies and for

183
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,440
Citizens we're kind of new to Belgium

184
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,880
uh we also offer kinds of excursions and

185
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,380
I'll say more about that as well and

186
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,099
these are mandatory fun

187
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,339
so how does the course look like uh

188
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,339
there's nine lectures

189
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,860
which we will try to make as interactive

190
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,740
as possible but there will be a degree

191
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,980
of me and US telling you stuff the

192
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,220
discussion seminars will be way more uh

193
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,080
flipped if you will where the content is

194
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,040
prepared by by you and then we discuss

195
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,459
this in the classroom so it's a bit of a

196
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:13,260
give and take there

197
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,540
we organized the

198
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,300
um the lectures in modules so you could

199
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,720
say there's four modules one organized

200
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
by me which deals with a general

201
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,060
introduction as you'll note today and

202
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,420
then we'll delve into theories

203
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,140
of world and Global cities looking at

204
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,019
what explains their Genesis what their

205
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,959
characteristics are uh why it matters

206
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,779
and what kind of the main processes are

207
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,440
that characterize Urban Societies in

208
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,660
world and Global cities and one of the

209
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,700
main debates there is

210
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,440
to what extent are these places

211
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,240
polarized

212
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
either in terms of ethnicity income

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,800
levels professional levels Etc

214
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,300
with depth Sensitivity I would say to

215
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,459
uneven is within cities uh I'll pass on

216
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,740
the word to an experiments

217
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,320
we'll focus more on processes of urban

218
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,839
segregation we're looking at the spatial

219
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,120
processes behind that

220
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,480
and one of the main debates I would say

221
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,700
in uh issues of diversity and ethnicity

222
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,060
is to what extent there are neighborhood

223
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,140
effects

224
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,300
is the fact that you live within a

225
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,240
certain neighborhood affecting your

226
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,779
future trajectories life chances Etc so

227
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:40,560
that's one of the main debates there and

228
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,800
there's pros and cons there's Arguments

229
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,959
for and against the existence of

230
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,300
neighborhood effects

231
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,579
um then we passed on to uh boss from

232
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,680
Hood who will be talking about uh you

233
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,320
could say the cultural approach

234
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,140
uh thinking about different cultures of

235
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,019
urban research and then so this deals

236
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,360
with various methods and mostly with you

237
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,959
could say uh an older cultural turn uh

238
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,940
within geography in the social sciences

239
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,640
more widely which was took place after

240
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,320
the second world war and then more

241
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,959
recently in the 80s and 90s okay the

242
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,380
real cultural turn where was all about

243
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,540
um a turn towards more qualitative

244
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,720
research methods other sources uh that

245
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,459
that could be studied and that could

246
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,160
serve the study herbis Urban societies

247
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,100
and then this is also mobilized in the

248
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,839
study of urban cultures where it's about

249
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,779
creative Industries the lives of artists

250
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,480
Etc which is a big element in a lot of

251
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,079
I'd say discourses on the creative city

252
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,339
as you may know the work of Richard

253
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,279
Florida it was all hype I would say 20

254
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,300
years ago that all cities should be

255
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,040
geared toward becoming creative in one

256
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,279
way or another so hence also large focus

257
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,339
on the literature on issues of arts and

258
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,740
culture as it is connected to the issues

259
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,260
of Urban Development

260
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,740
and the final part is with vojtek

261
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,899
blovsky

262
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:13,740
looking into through the lens of of

263
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,839
transport and mobility and what we can

264
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,360
learn about cities and he will be

265
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,060
talking about different kinds of agendas

266
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,560
that's typify I would say

267
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,779
transport studies all the way from

268
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,940
neoclassical views that connected to

269
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,480
Urban growth development to

270
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,519
sustainability issues which is a

271
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,980
paradigm in an office Zone and then

272
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,140
he'll be yeah drawing on his own

273
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,139
research looking more into what he calls

274
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,839
critical perspectives on Urban transport

275
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,600
where it's all about yeah who actually

276
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,000
benefits from the current Transportation

277
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,300
regime what are issues of inequality who

278
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,060
makes uh decisions about in Transport

279
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,700
Systems Etc so

280
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,920
I think by the end you should have a

281
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,240
kind of a 360 degree overview of uh of

282
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,660
debates in urban geography obviously

283
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,480
um we don't know everything far from

284
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,480
that so it's a selection of debates

285
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,480
um we could generate another curriculum

286
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,060
based with other forms of expertise but

287
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,000
it's also an exercise in trying to

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,980
um critically triangulate different

289
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,959
perspectives on the city through

290
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,760
different kind of tips which come with

291
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,240
their own methodologies Etc so that's uh

292
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,399
the setup of the course

293
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,880
and these take place here uh you just

294
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,279
about fit in this room so I'm extremely

295
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,060
happy and pleased and will take place on

296
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,839
Mondays between five and seven

297
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,459
um let's see what the quality of the

298
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,339
streaming is uh I if I would open

299
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,380
panopto which is my program I could

300
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,920
expect a stream of comments about that

301
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,959
but so I'll evaluate that but the the

302
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,240
idea is that everything is streamed as

303
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,459
well people that can't make it because

304
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,760
of yeah conflicts with work

305
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,220
um or well they might have time but

306
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,740
can't reach VB because it's immediately

307
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,100
uh after uh the working day I mean I

308
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,260
would understand that you would

309
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,139
um yeah follow remotely

310
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,320
um and sessions will also be recorded

311
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,660
on the other hand it's a kind of strict

312
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,240
recommendation to try to be here as much

313
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,360
as possible because I mean one of the

314
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,420
insights from the corona crisis yeah

315
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,199
when you watch remotely sometimes it's

316
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,899
hard to maintain discipline I also

317
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,060
recognize that with all kinds of zoomy

318
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,040
things and zoom

319
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
um I don't know seminars

320
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,040
so having a habit of coming to vud

321
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,019
coming to class I think it's also a way

322
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,180
to stay connected not only to the course

323
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,639
content but also to one another so

324
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,920
you could uh fall back on this but I

325
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,680
would not recommend uh a full digital

326
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,519
semester uh in any case so but it's it's

327
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,680
there and it will be your resource if

328
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,959
all goes well uh at the very end

329
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,060
so yeah we're here

330
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,300
a bit more on the discussion seminar so

331
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,820
yes please there was a question

332
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,120
foreign

333
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,980
yeah it's to have some slack uh in this

334
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,920
room we'll aim for two hours but we

335
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,600
already started like five minutes late

336
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,339
today

337
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,420
um so don't uh be upset if we take until

338
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,240
10 past seven but the idea is that it

339
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,399
would be two hours

340
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,620
um yeah depends a bit on what happens

341
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,100
yes

342
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,240
Excuse me

343
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,459
yes I'll post them online after each

344
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,839
session

345
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:01,980
um

346
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,680
yeah and if you go to the canvas page

347
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,060
and I guess some of you are not yet

348
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,459
uh be able to access uh come with us but

349
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,740
that should be resorted quite soon

350
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,160
you'll see at the starting page and I

351
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,320
made all kinds of modules there's a kind

352
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,300
of an outline module and there's a

353
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,920
module per session

354
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,380
where you'll see

355
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,199
um the required readings some additional

356
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,860
readings outposts a link to

357
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,019
um no I won't do it there I'll post a

358
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,720
link to the recordings any announcements

359
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,620
there will be session slides linked to

360
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,320
um to each of these modules so I mean I

361
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,300
think it's neatly organized so you

362
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,880
should find your way there basically all

363
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,759
content will be provided online for

364
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,519
people that cannot access

365
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,639
um canvas yet

366
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,940
please find somebody who has access and

367
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,500
try to share I would say the course

368
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,360
outline

369
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,660
um so please be aware that some of you

370
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,880
don't have access yet I think by next

371
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,059
week it should be okay

372
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,819
so yeah let's see

373
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,040
so yeah next to the lectures

374
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,980
um there's discussion seminars where we

375
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,859
basically use the reader

376
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,079
um to advance our insights into these

377
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,900
discussions around urban geography and

378
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,120
we take the various modules so four

379
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,980
modules and we organize that in one

380
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,200
block where we'll have a discussion

381
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,799
which is basically prepared by uo and

382
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,620
different kind of smaller presentations

383
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,059
and then we have a collective discussion

384
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,320
about

385
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,320
uh it's also in the outline so it's a

386
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,179
different kind of series of discussion

387
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,640
seminars because you can't have a debate

388
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,860
with 200 people in the room

389
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,500
uh so it's more like a classroom format

390
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,840
uh one for the master in urban studies

391
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,140
one track for four cities and then uh

392
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,660
also one for geographers and urbanists

393
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,340
and one go

394
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,400
um for mus and for cities it won't be on

395
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,500
Mondays it's on different times uh

396
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,500
during the week it's in uh your time

397
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,700

please check uh if you've already

399
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,679
identified where the time schedule is

400
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,400
also when the room information is

401
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,380
um and try to notice down in your agenda

402
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,760
because there will be an assignment

403
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,340
later that a small one but I would say

404
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,919
an important one okay please note that

405
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,820
down in your return

406
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,000
um also note that the lectures at some

407
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,740
point will have three lectures now but

408
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,020
then we will Skip One Week

409
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,140
uh before we go to the next module then

410
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,780
two classes then we Skip One Week etc

411
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,840
etc and it is because on certain Mondays

412
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,120
after module will have a discussion

413
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,360
seminar with geographers and urbanists

414
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,120
because it's we can't expect work

415
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,240
students to be here during the day

416
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,400
um so we will take these Mondays and

417
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,460
also please take notes for uh

418
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,799
myths and four cities that you don't

419
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,260

420
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,840

seminars for another group okay just so

424
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,179
you know it could be a week also to

425
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,400
prepare a little bit more uh for the

426
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,440
discussion seminar that you you may have

427
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,940
yourself

428
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,640
okay I'll say more about the assignment

429
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,860
link to that in a second then Urban

430
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,440
social geography excursions uh there's a

431
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,260
lot of administration here apparently

432
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,980
um

433
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,440
we offer four excursions but because of

434
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,419
the size of the group this is for Miss

435
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,200
and for cities uh we'll have to

436
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,220
um yeah force you to make a short Choice

437
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,620
um so there's four excursions one uh led

438
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,660
by me here in Brussels which deal with

439
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,179
Brussels as a global City uh next few

440
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,520
months takes you to Antwerp to deal with

441
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,120
issues of Social and ethnic segregation

442
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,400
Minds that this is a bike trip so maybe

443
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,580
some of you are less comfortable with uh

444
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,860
biking just taken to this into account

445
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,840
others may be extremely experienced and

446
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,059
fight the rates uh too slow and also

447
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,100
don't want to join

448
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,860
um then there's an Excursion to show

449
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,400
everyone Again by Nick

450
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,260
and then wojtek will take you on

451
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,960
Excursion in Brussels around the team of

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,740
everyday Mobility

453
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,000
um so for excursions you have to choose

454
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,860
two

455
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,200
um this is also something that I I um

456
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,620
mentioned in this uh Google Sheets or

457
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,419
spreadsheets

458
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,120
um please try to go for one Brussels

459
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,100
Excursion and one other Excursion

460
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,720
because we want to kind of give

461
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,059
everybody the opportunity to go beyond

462
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,520
Brussels otherwise your remain stuck in

463
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,039
the Brussels bubble uh so there's please

464
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,679
select either Antwerp I would say or

465
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,059
either Charlotte yes the hunter bike

466
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,059
trip is actually like right here by

467
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,220
people from Russell's pointer no okay

468
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,799
you go by train and then

469
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,260
I don't think it's even the entire day

470
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,539
but at some point you'll go to the

471
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,059
locked Bowl which is kind of a

472
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,360
social housing product project from I

473
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,320
think the 60s if I'm not mistaken uh and

474
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,679
to reach that you'll go by by bike

475
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,400
um

476
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,260
yeah some people feel less comfortable

477
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,659
doing that uh

478
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:42,539
you could also say we have uh one month

479
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,380
to get trained uh so in any case it

480
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,059
could be an opportunity but take this

481
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,539
into account uh yes it was a question

482
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,320
and bring our own way no no no no no no

483
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,200
no no no no yeah well there's a bike

484
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,260
rental yeah Nick has arranged bikes are

485
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,640
there any other questions about this

486
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,640
uh not yet no uh but typically I mean

487
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,799
this would be communicated they start in

488
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,480
the early morning and the end at the end

489
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,620
of the day

490
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,340
um

491
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,860
yeah so it's a full day

492
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,600
see

493
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,900
okay

494
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,580
so please uh go to this um spreadsheet

495
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,020
and fill out your preferences

496
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,520
all right

497
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,340
okay I hope this uh the skills it

498
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,220
and fill out your preferences uh as soon

499
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,000
as possible and no later than next week

500
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,880
okay so there's limited capacity for

501
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,320
each of these

502
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,780
um excursions

503
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,960
so please uh take care of it

504
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,240
all right a bit more about the course

505
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,039
materials

506
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,360
um as you will see on canvas there's a

507
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,179
reader with what I call required reading

508
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,179
so I expect everybody

509
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:17,460
reach this at least once and preferably

510
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,460
in advance of advance of each lecture

511
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,799
it's a kind of way to keep track of of

512
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,120
the discussion

513
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,679
and there will also be additional

514
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,960
readings and these additional readings

515
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,700
will kind of be the resource that we

516
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,510
will use in the discussion seminars

517
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,240
[Music]

518
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,960
um

519
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,840
yeah the rest I've said already

520
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,100
um session slides and recordings

521
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,240
available after each session

522
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,179
and then this is weird and then

523
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,240
um yeah you'll have access via compost a

524
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,220
bit more about evaluation and great

525
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,380
distribution

526
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,260
so this assignment in the discussion

527
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,940
seminar

528
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,860
um is

529
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,220
um a critical summary and it accounts

530
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,580
for one-fifth of your total grade so

531
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,140
it's a kind of uh

532
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,960
a way to to be remunerated if you will

533
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,780
for your efforts during the semester but

534
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,539
the whole idea is that we digest our way

535
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,460
through

536
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,780
the literature and through the reader

537
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,799
that we do this in a collective way

538
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,380
um so what is the assignment

539
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,720
um all students have to read the

540
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,720
required readings but then

541
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,780
um

542
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,659
I have no idea what to do actually

543
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:44,419
uh let me just check this is off

544
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,010
[Music]

545
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:00,020
yeah no idea

546
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,340
okay let's let's just try to continue

547
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,360
um

548
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,940
so part two you'll be invited to

549
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,400
critically summarize one additional

550
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,820
reading so it could be a paper on Beirut

551
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,200
for instance when we're talking about

552
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,419
global cities

553
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:19,919
and

554
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,240
um

555
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,120
yeah I'll announce the schedule uh for

556
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,980
that you'll have 10 minutes of

557
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,419
presentation

558
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:30,720
and what you're asked to do is that you

559
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,779
focus on a core quote or uh passage or

560
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,000
excerpt from the text that you kind of

561
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,799
use this as an introduction to the text

562
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,020
that you tell us all about the main

563
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,419
argument of the authors

564
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,059
that you connect this to The Wider

565
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,740
debate to the literature that we've been

566
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,779
discussing yeah we've been talking about

567
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,659
world and Global cities yeah what how do

568
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,120
you connect that to this particular

569
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,940
study that we're reading about and then

570
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,799
toward the end you want to give some

571
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,600
kind of a critical critical reflection

572
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,760
so you can also start with the critical

573
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,740
reflection and weave that through the

574
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,840
entire presentation but you should end

575
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,539
with a number of discussion questions uh

576
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,059
which we can use to kick start the

577
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,760
debate so 10 minutes you give kind of a

578
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,480
crash course summary of what the paper

579
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,700
is about why it matters what we learn

580
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,600
from it and how we connect that to to

581
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,120
the discussions that we already have

582
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,279
so that's the critical summary a bit

583
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,140
more on that second I'm sorry

584
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,539
yes okay yeah because otherwise it will

585
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,720
be an endless stream of presentations

586
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,779
it's something that you can do with two

587
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,940
um so yeah it's a and and both of you

588
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,279
should uh take the floor at some point

589
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,679
yeah so the idea is that it's a bit of a

590
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,919
balanced exercise and also try to make

591
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,460
this an integrated exercise not somebody

592
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,500
one person saying okay this is the

593
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,360
argument but then the other person not

594
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,220
knowing the argument but having come up

595
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,659
with with the neural questions so to

596
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,039
give a stupid example that's not the

597
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,900
idea so it really try to discuss the

598
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,380
text together and come to some kind of a

599
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,820
shared understanding there and already

600
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,520
debating this amongst the two of you

601
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,679
would already be something worthwhile I

602
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,840
think

603
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,520
yeah

604
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,500
yeah the largest part of the evaluation

605
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,779
is a written exam

606
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,299
and this is basically

607
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,419
um a way to test you could say your

608
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,580
knowledge of urban of the urban theories

609
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,440
and Concepts that we've been discussing

610
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,380
throughout the semester throughout the

611
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,960
different modules

612
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,539
there's no uh particular focus on

613
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:45,240
memorizing things by heart but it's

614
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,000
about

615
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,039
mobilizing your knowledge to study

616
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:53,600
empirical examples cases Etc

617
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,159
and I think we'll give examples of that

618
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,039
throughout the course

619
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,870
for instance when you think about

620
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,220
[Music]

621
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,120
um

622
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,200
culture as an as a

623
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,960
say Urban Development strategy you may

624
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,960
get a question about okay there's a new

625
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,380
soundtrack

626
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,740
next to the Brussels Canal Zone to what

627
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,520
extent is this a a case of cultural and

628
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,400
regeneration

629
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,919
discuss and then you would would have to

630
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,980
interpret the case on that base so it's

631
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,500
not just about reproduction that's about

632
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,539
applying what you've learned critically

633
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,539
reflecting on the different concepts Etc

634
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,480
and you'll use the readings the slides

635
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,900
the recordings personal notes from

636
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,900
seminars and lectures and yeah those who

637
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,779
went on a disc on an Excursion can also

638
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:54,000
always refer to

639
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,080
um to the filters to actually get a bit

640
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,179
of more inspiration

641
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,360
so that's uh the setup of the great

642
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,460
distribution

643
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,159
um and yeah a bit more still about this

644
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,440
critical summary

645
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,360
um just a number of questions that you

646
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,140
could use as a source of information

647
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,700
inspiration or a template

648
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,539
so what is the key message from the

649
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,940
paper why is it important what is the

650
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,539
key argument uh what have you learned

651
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,980
and really try to be as nuanced as

652
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,260
possible can you compare the argument

653
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,980
being made with other perspectives or a

654
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,899
perspective from the required readings

655
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,440
or anything

656
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,399
foreign

657
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,559
important

658
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:48,080
yeah this is getting a bit weird now

659
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,460
yeah I have no idea

660
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,679
when I move I have the impression

661
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,500
um

662
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,840
okay let's try uh to continue

663
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,949
[Music]

664
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,220
yeah okay

665
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,240
I wonder what would happen if I would

666
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,299
push the out button but then I think

667
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,500
maybe

668
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,240
you know it might be singles or

669
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,380
something

670
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,899
yeah okay

671
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,220
do you really think that would be the

672
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,960
case yeah

673
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,840
yeah interference but everybody switch

674
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,779
off their phones is that an option it's

675
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,419
like 100 phones being switched off is

676
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:51,679
that possible to try yeah

677
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,080
but I don't really find it I think it's

678
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,159
necessary

679
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,200
yeah

680
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,299
but yeah

681
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:03,120
I think that's the most I can do

682
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
actually

683
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,960
maybe yeah let's try okay maybe we'll

684
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,299
have to live with it or I can sort it

685
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,399
out later

686
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,520
um

687
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,700
what happens if I

688
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,419
go this one

689
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,240
foreign

690
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,470
[Music]

691
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:00,500
excuse me

692
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,860
unknowingly

693
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,600
okay I'm not a genius this is clear by

694
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,220
now

695
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,880
um

696
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,000
all right uh and um yeah final point

697
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,059
that I already set this uh try something

698
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,360
um the debate that's that's what uh what

699
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,980
it's all about in the end okay

700
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,320
no you have to do this one

701
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,360
one so what I'll do as soon as I have

702
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,980
the full overviews who had actually

703
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,980
taking this course but make a schedule

704
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,620
uh and then you'll have to present once

705
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,080
yeah with somebody else

706
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,140
um

707
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,779
campus or

708
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,399
um it's not on canvas it's a different

709
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,820
kind of Google Sheets but you can click

710
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,220
the link in the in the slides that I

711
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,020
just uh showed so yeah

712
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,039
um

713
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,020
for those who don't have access to

714
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,140
converse uh maybe ask somebody who has

715
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,260
to share this link or just ask somebody

716
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,740
to to sign you up uh via this link

717
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,299
um okay

718
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,580
is that clear

719
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,559
there's a whole lot of administration

720
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:23,340
sorry for that uh but that's how it goes

721
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,559
I guess so I hope everything is clear

722
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,100
yes please

723
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,440
yeah but I'll make the the distribution

724
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,620
oh yeah because otherwise if we do this

725
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,240
bottom up then

726
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,840
it will be very very difficult uh so

727
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,899
I'll yeah but all texts are interesting

728
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,519
I would say

729
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,360
um

730
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,360
so so that's the idea but uh it might

731
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,820
take a while because I think for for

732
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,980
most and four cities it's quite clear so

733
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,960
that could go fast maybe for geographers

734
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,200
and uh stat it could last a little bit

735
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,940
longer because sometimes it's unclear

736
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,320
who is actually in the course but for

737
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,940
most unfortunately I think this can go

738
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,679
actually quite fast and then you can

739
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,139
also plan a little bit uh work in the

740
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,460
semester

741
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,260
um okay

742
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,879
together

743
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,320
all right

744
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,119
so uh let's turn to some content then

745
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,399
uh and let's start our trip

746
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,960
what we'll be discussing in Earth today

747
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,760
is basically what we'll do is we'll

748
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,440
deconstruct uh the title course

749
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,619
um and ask four questions

750
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,839
what is the Urban

751
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,060
what is the city

752
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,099
what is geography

753
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:50,580
and what does it mean when I say I'm

754
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,020
critical

755
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,060
arguably critical is not in the title

756
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,460
but it could have been right

757
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,240
it may seem consensible but I think

758
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,180
asking these very blue sky questions

759
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,180
perhaps uh could get us closer to an

760
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,740
understanding what urban geography is

761
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,599
about so you can also start already

762
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,060
start thinking a little bit about

763
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,820
what we would mean with the term the

764
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,420
urban and uh the city

765
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,119
maybe as I take you to a number of

766
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,359
exhibits you can draw some inspiration

767
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,760
for that and you can make a list and

768
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,619
then in a few minutes you'll be invited

769
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,680
to write a very short one minute paper

770
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,839
it doesn't have to be Pros where you

771
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,579
collect a little bit of ideas on what

772
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:39,560
those two terms could be okay

773
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,520
probably and one of the reasons why some

774
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,000
of you have studied uh or selected the

775
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,980
master in urban studies for four cities

776
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,660
is because you have been seduced by a

777
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,060
discourse or a frame of we live in the

778
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,540
urban age processes occur increasingly

779
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,280
in cities therefore we need to

780
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,079
understand cities if we want to make

781
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,540
sense of our futures or something like

782
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,180
that and this would be some kind of a

783
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,700
framework or repertoire

784
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,700
um that the world uh that United Nations

785
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,440
sorry calls a framework of the urban age

786
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,380
and it's a kind of frame that says well

787
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,500
we've long been a you could say rural

788
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,460
global population or a rural species but

789
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,599
at some point and someday in 2005 we

790
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,740
became an urban species and ever since

791
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,660
uh basically world population growth

792
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,920
will be Urban growth so increasingly we

793
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,140
are undergoing as a global Society a

794
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,839
process of urbanization where more and

795
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,880
more people

796
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,579
become Urban so this kind of Mantra of

797
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,520
the urban age has been around since

798
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,180
about 2007 so immediately after this

799
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,960
historical Urban transition

800
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,820
and it has been repeated as a kind of a

801
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,700
motivation for increased attention at

802
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,920
the cities so and there's something

803
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,320
behind that obviously because there is

804
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,200
indeed a transition to the urban and

805
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,320
this observable here empirically roughly

806
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,980
in the 1950s about 70 percent of of the

807
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,740
population global population lived in

808
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,640
rural areas and only 30 percent in urban

809
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,420
areas it was 50 50 apparently around

810
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,560
2005 and now it's reversed uh or it's

811
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,500
going to be reversed by 2050 expectation

812
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,740
is that 70 of the global population will

813
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,380
live in cities okay

814
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,440
so that's kind of the framework of the

815
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,220
urban age that is very much kind of uh

816
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,680
projected by the United Nations by all

817
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,240
kinds of uh world uh World reports and

818
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,220
that is kind of taken over by both

819
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,099
critical and more uncritical uh voices

820
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,440
in the debate

821
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,960
McKinsey would also use this to argue

822
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,839
for more consultancy into uh urban

823
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,160
government or something

824
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,060
but it's just as much Mike Davis when he

825
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,480
talks about uh cities of slums he'll use

826
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,240
this as a critical framework to refer to

827
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,079
make his kind of his work important

828
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,960
so what is behind this is an assumed

829
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,820
process or an identifiable process of

830
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,500
globalized urbanization so the process

831
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,760
by which

832
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,640
the urban condition if you will is

833
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,160
becoming a global phenomenon

834
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,579
and urbanization used to be something

835
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,099
that was not Global at all and if you

836
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:53,720
look at a few maps by Michael patrolling

837
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,660
uh who has a great handbook uh on on

838
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,040
cities

839
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,740
you see that it was very much say a

840
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,520
Western European or Northern American

841
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,160
Affair so UK

842
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,339
was extremely urbanized European

843
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:12,540
continents

844
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,800
also quite and the us as well apparently

845
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,480
Alaska was also extremely urbanized

846
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,579
the rest of the world was on the map but

847
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:27,119
not really on the map of urbanization uh

848
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,680
it didn't occurred there

849
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,599
fast forward to the 1950s you see that

850
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,480
this process is spreading uh especially

851
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,760
you could say throughout the European

852
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,740
continents throughout the Commonwealth

853
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,839
you see Australia and Canada popping up

854
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,780
also I could say more

855
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,300
developmentalists say to Latin America

856
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,400
uh USSR

857
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,839
and uh to a very very limited extent uh

858
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,380
Africa and then especially the market

859
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,040
not so much in Asia as you can see

860
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,400
we're moving forward 1990s

861
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,880
we see that this process is both

862
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,520
extending geographically and I uh

863
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,579
intensified so a lot of countries or

864
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:20,099
quite a few countries in Europe have now

865
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,320
an urbanization rate apparently between

866
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,740
80 and 100 percent which is kind of the

867
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,560
ratio between population that lives in

868
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,619
cities on the total population so

869
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:34,920
between 80 and 100 of people live in

870
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,099
cities according to these definitions

871
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:40,859
again note Australia uh it's a

872
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:45,000
tremendously urbanized uh continent if

873
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,460
you will obviously this is a projection

874
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,220
of the ratio on the entire territory

875
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,180
okay so uh almost all Australians live

876
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,119
in cities but that doesn't mean that the

877
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,540
entirety of Australia is a city okay

878
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,020
Maps could lie to some extent okay so we

879
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,900
may be exaggerating some things when we

880
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,760
think about uh

881
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,500
I don't know the use of Natural

882
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,040
Resources or environmental impact uh

883
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,300
that's that's something that we could

884
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,520
think about

885
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,560
um what is also important is kind of a

886
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,079
different kind of figure is that there's

887
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,880
some kind of a decoupling between

888
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,680
processes of

889
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,500
one of a better word uh economic growth

890
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,020
or what some people call uh more

891
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,119
problematically development

892
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,140
and urbanization when you go back to say

893
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,300
the history of urbanization in the 19th

894
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,540
century it was a pro a process that was

895
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,079
intimately linked to industrialization

896
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,480
economic growth but also obviously as we

897
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,900
know uneven development within Western

898
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,400
European cities

899
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,560
there was a lot of economic development

900
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,160
in the UK cities like Manchester uh

901
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,140
because there was a boom of the textile

902
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,380
industry it led to economic growth but

903
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,240
it also led to huge uh Urban

904
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,000
inequalities but in any case at the

905
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,339
aggregate level you could say at the

906
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:13,020
level of the country or the city there

907
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,380
was an economic Improvement

908
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,000
and that connected to the growth of

909
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,320
these cities

910
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,380
what you find in you could say the last

911
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,359
20 years and this has something to do

912
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:27,020
with all kinds of neoliberal policies

913
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,119
that work at the global scale especially

914
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,760
when you talk about Asia and

915
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,400
Africa you could say

916
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,680
um uh the Strategic adjustment plans

917
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,099
that have been rolled out there by uh

918
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,140
organizations such as the international

919
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,140
monetary fund and its sister or brother

920
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,020
the World Bank which has basic basically

921
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,060
opened up the borders of these conflict

922
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,880
countries to foreign investment as this

923
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,940
would uh Kickstart growth okay

924
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,700
in reality one could argue that this has

925
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,460
produced produced a dependent form of

926
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,220
growth or you could say an exploitative

927
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,460
relation between the global periphery

928
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,119
and the global core okay but at the same

929
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,520
time has initiated and this is kind of

930
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,520
the argument by Mike Davis an implosion

931
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,700
of the countryside rural living in these

932
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,140
places

933
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,160
um became untenable because a lot of uh

934
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,140
it's a subsidized activities or

935
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,060
state-controlled activities were rolled

936
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,880
back for instance in agriculture this

937
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,619
led to huge deprivation on the

938
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:38,220
countryside and in varying degrees a

939
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,859
search to go for the battle better life

940
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,619
than in a lot of African majoriences

941
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:44,940
Okay so

942
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,819
if we thought that it could be a sign of

943
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:50,220
Economic Development we could say in the

944
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,440
19th century and even if we take up with

945
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,720
a pinch of salt that's still not

946
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,240
possible to say in uh when you talk

947
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,819
about urbanization rates for instance in

948
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:04,640
in Africa or parts of Asia okay

949
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,040
now uh so and if you look at the rates

950
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,900
of urbanization we're talking about

951
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,119
seven to eight percent in some uh

952
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,540
sub-Saharan African countries whereas if

953
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,319
you look at the older industrial areas

954
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,420
or urbanized areas it's somewhere

955
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,880
between one and two percent still growth

956
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,579
so we're doubling I would say in 36

957
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:29,700
years uh if it's two percent uh but far

958
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,980
far less

959
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,119
um

960
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,480
so yes globalized urbanization that also

961
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,180
shows when you look at the hit list of

962
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,819
largest cities

963
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:45,540
um it was very much uh euro-american if

964
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,980
you will

965
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,220
uh the industrial heart heartlands some

966
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,160
exceptions Shanghai for instance uh

967
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,500
Japan

968
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,619
1950s but then it starts to really

969
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,440
diversify and become actually a matter

970
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,560
of not Euro America but Asia Latin

971
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,720
America Etc and a number of leading

972
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,839
cities in terms of population

973
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,880
in the 1950s now well down the list to

974
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,700
take New York for instance others okay

975
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,920
so this is kind of the thesis that

976
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,680
urbanization is now a globalized

977
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,920
phenomenon there's still different kind

978
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,160
of patterns behind that just you can

979
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,020
look into this at home because it may be

980
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,920
a bit small to actually read here

981
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,119
um

982
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,880
some places when you look at Europe uh

983
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,540
we're talking about 80 urbanization

984
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,540
still in Africa despite its uh large

985
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,000
urbanization rate

986
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,740
still foremost a rural Society so even

987
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,720
this despite a kind of a global

988
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,460
transition toward globalized

989
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,440
urbanization that's quite a bit of

990
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,300
regional differences that we need to

991
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,280
take into account

992
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,859
and that brings me to the next slide

993
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:08,339
this famous image that I stole it from

994
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:12,780
Neil Brenner uh uh where Batman beats

995
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,700
the crap out of Robin because he begins

996
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,560
to talk about

997
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,619
um this urban urban age again I think

998
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:22,440
it's a moment to really uh question

999
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,140
critically what is meant by the urban

1000
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,240
agent to what extent we should really

1001
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,940
believe and go along in this Urban age

1002
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,359
frame and and a very nice paper I

1003
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,500
haven't put it in the reader because

1004
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,020
there's already quite a bit of of things

1005
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,359
in there

1006
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:40,800
is a paper by a new Brenner and

1007
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,579
Christian Smith from 2014.

1008
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:47,339
and they really deconstruct uh this

1009
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:49,400
narrative and they point to two elements

1010
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,140
one is

1011
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,920
the notion or the idea uh or the

1012
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,119
observation that we're living in the

1013
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,339
urban age could be a statistical

1014
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,760
artifact so it's a matter of how we

1015
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,740
measure things

1016
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,660
and there's actually quite a bit of

1017
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,380
Divergence over time but also across

1018
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:15,119
countries as to how a city is actually

1019
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,380
measured

1020
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,480
in some contexts

1021
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,200
um

1022
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,780
there's a city

1023
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,300
um something counts as a city as of 1

1024
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,400
000 inhabitants in other countries it

1025
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,740
would be ten thousand and it would have

1026
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,520
a tremendous impact on how we calculate

1027
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,140
the urbanization

1028
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,160
okay so this is more fundamentally uh

1029
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,680
what they argue is that there's a huge

1030
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,560
nationalist bias in how the urban is

1031
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,720
defined I'm not saying that there's 200

1032
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,839
definitions but for instance when you

1033
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,540
look at at the work the work of

1034
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,380
um

1035
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,839
of organizations like the United Nations

1036
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,839
they have been struggling to set a

1037
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,140
standard definition of what the urban is

1038
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,180
there's still quite a bit of diversity

1039
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,579
and when you look at the work of urban

1040
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:07,800
geographers for the past 50 or 60 years

1041
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,020
this is a kind of a recurring issue

1042
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,800
right so what they say is that yes there

1043
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,859
are real empirical caps in our knowledge

1044
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:21,000
here of of of the rate of urbanization

1045
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,880
uh and therefore it's almost meaningless

1046
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,680
to say as in some day in 2005 we became

1047
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,839
more urban are we by now our Urban

1048
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:33,420
species so it's kind of yes there's a

1049
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,160
broad trajectory uh toward urbanization

1050
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,339
but there's a very large bandwidth that

1051
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:45,300
that we should consider and in fact it

1052
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,740
could be more interesting to look at

1053
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,119
different kind of urbanization

1054
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,060
trajectories because it's it's dealing

1055
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,740
with all kinds of different processes

1056
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,440
that need to be studied as historically

1057
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,160
unfolding rologists then being captured

1058
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,420
in a figure of 75 for this so it's more

1059
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,460
of an invitation to start looking at

1060
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,500
things so this also connects to the

1061
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,180
second argument

1062
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,240
is that the urban as it is being

1063
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,380
measured by a process of urbanization is

1064
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,859
somewhat of a chaotic abstraction it

1065
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:21,300
means that

1066
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,079
um

1067
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,000
different kind of things that are not

1068
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,180
necessarily related are packed together

1069
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,720
to define a certain process

1070
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,700
and and this is something that for

1071
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,380
instance a new Brenner and Chris

1072
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,119
Christian Smith have also worked on

1073
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:38,460
later as they discussed the notion of

1074
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,980
planetary urbanization I invite you to

1075
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,760
look into that debate their argument is

1076
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,520
that the urban in fact as a condition as

1077
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,560
a way of life or as a system of

1078
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,660
production or exploitation does not

1079
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,500
neatly overlay actual morphologies of

1080
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,579
cities

1081
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:00,780
so the urban uh may have nothing to do

1082
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:05,579
with a concentrated uh blob of people in

1083
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,980
space or with sitting within a

1084
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,780
particular jurisdiction it could be

1085
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,680
connected to suburbs etc etc so and what

1086
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,020
they kind of are concerned with is when

1087
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,380
you talk about rates of urbanization is

1088
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,319
that you classify or categorize quite

1089
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,099
diverse uh ways of of living into one

1090
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,940
category of the urban uh and an even

1091
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,940
more problematic so hence we don't

1092
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,460
really learn anything about it and what

1093
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,500
is even more problematic is that the

1094
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,440
rule is defined as the non-urban

1095
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,780
and is thereby

1096
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,599
yeah not studied at all as kind of a

1097
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,599
left behind place that only exists in

1098
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,520
opposition to what really counts which

1099
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,800
is then the way forward which is urban

1100
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,859
living so that's kind of their arguments

1101
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:58,500
just to kick start a little bit you're

1102
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,260
thinking uh on this

1103
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,559
since we now have uh I would say 60

1104
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,319
seconds for a one minute paper Okay so

1105
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,599
please think a little bit you can talk

1106
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,819
to your neighbor

1107
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:15,119
um in any direction about what the urban

1108
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,660
is what a city is and what the

1109
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,700
differences between the two right

1110
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,579
thank you

1111
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,589
[Music]

1112
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,389
[Music]

1113
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:17,900
[Music]

1114
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,800
thank you

1115
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,220
very much

1116
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,889
[Music]

1117
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,500
those were 120 seconds

1118
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,280
right here

1119
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,079
okay

1120
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,599
[Applause]

1121
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,819
for almost three minutes for the one

1122
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,339
week paper

1123
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:21,780
please

1124
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,000
what is a city what's the urban and

1125
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,480
what's the difference

1126
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,540
okay

1127
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,180
so what's the difference then what do

1128
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,500
you say

1129
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,079
why is the urban a place

1130
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,059
oh maybe not

1131
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:53,339
because there are quite density of many

1132
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:57,079
layers and cities

1133
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,480
okay and why do you think it's the

1134
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,240
reverse I think elements of the oven can

1135
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,520
exist everywhere I don't think elements

1136
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,040
of the city exist everyone so the city

1137
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,920
defined as a dense place is kind of

1138
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,740
identifiable in space whereas the urban

1139
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,260
could yeah connect to everywhere

1140
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,559
potentially okay

1141
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:22,339
other ideas

1142
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,700
or inequality or like in an infield

1143
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,319
environment this is something you can

1144
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,559
touch

1145
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,819
so one is about you could say concrete

1146
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:49,099
lumps of material yeah

1147
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,460
about Urban societies yeah

1148
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,240
other ideas yeah

1149
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,119
yeah I think that connects a little bit

1150
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:09,000
to what what we say processes and then

1151
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,460
maybe outcomes products of urbanization

1152
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,200
okay now other ideas

1153
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,800
Etc

1154
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,420
and that wouldn't be captured by the

1155
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,000
notion of a city

1156
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,960
if not cities can be

1157
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,500
places of extreme exclusivity okay

1158
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,280
um of dedicated to a very specific class

1159
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,380
so a lot not all cities have

1160
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,740
same the Notions of having public

1161
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,480
transport that is Affordable for

1162
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,400
everyone but I would say that if you're

1163
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,859
talking about the urban you're already

1164
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,079
thinking of it in terms of how do we

1165
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,599
organize this mass group of people okay

1166
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,079
and how do we get order into

1167
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:10,800
um

1168
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,079
so it's about the club projects

1169
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,660
particular values perhaps behind

1170
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,420
policies to organize cities we are

1171
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,280
building on the process idea that was

1172
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,839
mentioned earlier

1173
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:22,920
okay

1174
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,460
any other ideas still

1175
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,460
yeah I think maybe for a city I think of

1176
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,380
it having

1177
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,280
focus of like

1178
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:38,099
being people and maybe that also nothing

1179
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,319
on to sort of like a governance

1180
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,839
structure versus for urban I maybe think

1181
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,220
more about

1182
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,059
what is the like level of density and

1183
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:51,859
the living situation and people okay

1184
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:56,880
okay or like a descriptor versus like a

1185
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,720
um

1186
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,260
thing that everybody is like linked to

1187
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,420
or participating in yeah yeah yeah okay

1188
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,940
yeah there was a hand still behind

1189
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,400
somewhere yeah at the back

1190
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
um

1191
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,999
[Music]

1192
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:25,880
[Music]

1193
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,819
yeah so it's an administrative unit

1194
00:57:28,819 --> 00:57:32,579
which elected officials Etc that

1195
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:34,859
accounts within the boundaries of a

1196
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:36,180
certain space and not beyond that

1197
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,800
perhaps

1198
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,099
all right so inductively you make my

1199
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:43,200
made my next slide's completely

1200
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,980
redundant uh so yeah one of the ideas

1201
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,680
and importantly to say I mean with

1202
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,240
Brandon Schmidt it's kind of a

1203
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,059
sensitivity that the urban and cities

1204
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:56,280
are not necessarily the same

1205
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,839
I think

1206
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,880
the point is not to say or to Define

1207
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,319
clearly what

1208
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:04,260
a city is or the urban is but you offer

1209
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,380
different kind of perspectives

1210
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,420
um different kind of lenses

1211
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,260
on on the question and by offering

1212
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,720
different kind of perspectives

1213
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,520
are emerging from different kind of

1214
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,500
questions we may actually learn more

1215
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,140
about the process of urbanization so it

1216
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:25,020
is not kind of one ruling explanation

1217
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,420
but there's many ways of looking at it

1218
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,640
okay

1219
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,980
um but I think yeah we'll get to

1220
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,339
something more so one idea is that it's

1221
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:36,240
about

1222
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,180
a concentration of people it's also also

1223
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,700
about the concentration of stuff

1224
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,700
lump of material the built environment

1225
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,380
yeah so it's something with density

1226
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,480
something also a lot of I think

1227
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,940
urbanists would recognize so it's the

1228
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,880
built environment built up space that

1229
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,880
clearly gives morphological uh signs

1230
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,579
that at some point we have arrived in

1231
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:02,900
the city be it high rises

1232
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,839
a lot of of congestion uh that would be

1233
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:10,440
markers of characteristics of so that's

1234
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,380
kind of not necessarily Urban but it's a

1235
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,760
kind of a marker of what is a city

1236
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,760
then fetching a little bit more into

1237
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,799
you could say the overlays between what

1238
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:23,760
is urban

1239
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,400
and how it's the borders cities

1240
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,579
um cities are sometimes defined as uh

1241
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:34,440
the opposite of the non-city as I was

1242
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,260
saying uh as the opposite of the rural

1243
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,780
and then a number of planning contexts

1244
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,240
I'm thinking about for instance the

1245
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,579
Netherlands it will actually be if you

1246
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:46,380
look at the satellite image it will be

1247
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,400
identifiable where one urban area ends

1248
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,680
then there's Countryside and then

1249
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,780
something else starts

1250
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,980
but

1251
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,280
yeah in many contexts especially in the

1252
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,380
Flemish one for instance this is a

1253
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,240
reality where you won't get really far

1254
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,180
it's kind of you're not sure where the

1255
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,579
where the city ends you you end up with

1256
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:10,520
some kind of um

1257
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,579
large boulevards that connect to yeah

1258
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:16,980
villages in in the middle of nowhere

1259
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,400
there's a lot of built up uh stuff along

1260
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,579
these uh schustees Etc

1261
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,380
um and there's a lot of activities

1262
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,839
actually taking place outside of the

1263
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,119
core areas of urban agglomerations

1264
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:33,000
there's suburbs uh there's actually an

1265
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,660
intensification of activities in suburbs

1266
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,680
um

1267
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,119
so yeah

1268
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,940
um what does it still mean to talk about

1269
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:44,220
the city as being opposed to the

1270
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,099
non-city the rural it generates all

1271
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:49,760
kinds of fuzzy categories so purely

1272
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,579
morphologically you may end up

1273
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:58,099
um being in trouble now okay yes

1274
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:01,449
[Music]

1275
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,380
that's for me

1276
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,040
the city is something that is

1277
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,780
that's perpetually becoming something

1278
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,780
um

1279
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,200
energy where we can experiment with our

1280
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,440
identities and

1281
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,740
yeah yeah I agree uh we haven't covered

1282
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,660
this yet so maybe we're we're talking

1283
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,599
about about this so it's

1284
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,079
yeah the urban or a city uh is the place

1285
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:34,079
of an urban life but perhaps the urban

1286
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,260
also selections Beyond uh the city

1287
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,440
itself so Urban living could also be

1288
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,900
taking place in the suburbs but it's

1289
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,900
some kind of an idea that within

1290
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:46,680
um

1291
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,920
Within These spaces uh a different kind

1292
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,599
of society and a different kind of

1293
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,460
behavior uh Norms values can take place

1294
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,920
um so it's a distinctive way of life but

1295
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,200
still it could be

1296
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,020
um a very different kind of energy that

1297
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,700
we may be talking about or a different

1298
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,760
kind of bones that actually uh ties

1299
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,859
people together

1300
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:13,920
so just compare slum living with Loft

1301
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,420
living it's a very distinct way of urban

1302
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:21,240
living but they've been Mo both be

1303
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,980
characterized as something else than

1304
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,859
ruralism okay so

1305
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:27,299
um and there's this big debate I would

1306
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:30,420
say in urban sociology between what is

1307
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,079
now distinct about the urban way of life

1308
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,240
as some kind of an assumption that you

1309
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,599
move from Community uh to society and

1310
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,099
communities think about rural

1311
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:43,079
communities where you have all kinds of

1312
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:46,079
uh personal relations with neighbors

1313
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,299
it's a small villages and this gets

1314
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:53,940
formalized anonymized as soon as you get

1315
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,040
to cities because distances become

1316
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,119
larger because there's all kinds of

1317
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,619
institutional roles there's a division

1318
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:03,319
of labor that we'll get to in a second

1319
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:07,020
and it becomes more abstract you take a

1320
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,299
certain function within society which is

1321
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:12,420
less mediated my social relations that

1322
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,900
was kind of the argument uh by a lot of

1323
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,220
sociologists also in the 19th century

1324
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,500
that tried to capture the process of

1325
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,540
urbanization so it's a distinctive way

1326
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,819
of life it's not just buildings and

1327
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:27,599
humps and of material it's it's it's

1328
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,520
more than that

1329
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,260
another way of looking at it and with

1330
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,839
internet uh by you here at front it's

1331
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,720
also about economic relations that tie

1332
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,020
together people um think about flows of

1333
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,700
energy flows of of work flows of ideas

1334
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,559
uh flows of data

1335
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,140
um that's uh that connects the

1336
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,180
inhabitants of a certain place and it

1337
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,599
would be more uh agglomerated in some

1338
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:57,240
places than others but they wouldn't be

1339
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,000
necessarily confined to you could say

1340
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,280
the core of metropolitan areas

1341
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,799
so the city is also the place where

1342
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,440
divisions of labor emerge and there's

1343
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,960
this famous picture by Adam Smith's

1344
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,099
needle Factory or pin Factory uh where

1345
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:17,700
uh cities are kind of a microcosm of an

1346
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,700
uh a workshop where different kind of

1347
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,579
tasks that used to be integrated in uh

1348
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:27,000
in pin making are kind of cut up and

1349
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,720
collectively places uh produce a certain

1350
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,839
economic product okay so there's inputs

1351
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,760
needed by different kind of suppliers

1352
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,660
different kind of specialized workers do

1353
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:43,520
end up with a product okay so

1354
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,440
historically that has been a way where

1355
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,920
Urban Elites could emerge that could

1356
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,500
also kind of manage this process that

1357
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,319
could also absorb part of the Surplus

1358
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:58,079
that was being generated by a more

1359
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,260
efficient uh efficient division of labor

1360
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,960
standardization of work for instance and

1361
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,220
it was also you could say in a more

1362
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,799
critical framework the place where

1363
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:10,020
uneven development and urban

1364
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,420
inequalities actually have their Origins

1365
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,180
okay so it produced more efficiency it

1366
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,760
increased the urban Surplus if you will

1367
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,660
but not everybody benefited so a complex

1368
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,780
division of labor the idea that there

1369
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:28,140
are a collaboration Effects by being in

1370
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,640
a certain place

1371
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,920
economic agents for instance will

1372
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,200
benefit from from their presence because

1373
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,420
they have specialized inputs Etc that's

1374
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,819
kind of the realm of urban economics

1375
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:41,940
Urban economic geographies that try to

1376
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,099
capture that process

1377
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:45,900
enough is obviously when you talk about

1378
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,420
uh divisions of labor about these

1379
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,180
energies that go around these also

1380
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,920
structure

1381
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,559
um Urban spaces and you could say Urban

1382
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:58,200
class relations in a particular way

1383
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,640
so

1384
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,740
you could apply some kind of a

1385
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,859
regulationist perspective here thinking

1386
01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:06,180
about

1387
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:06,839
um

1388
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:10,799
we could say different eras of uh of of

1389
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:11,819
cities

1390
01:06:11,819 --> 01:06:14,520
as being engaged in particular

1391
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,040
production processes pre-capitalist

1392
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,520
cities for instance at the top left then

1393
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,940
the typical newly industrializing cities

1394
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:27,200
uh top right then going bottom left to

1395
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,299
for the cities and then you could say

1396
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:32,640
contemporary cities that are kind of

1397
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,940
both exploded and imploded at the same

1398
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,819
time with Rising densities at the edges

1399
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:41,339
and also a re-intensification of build

1400
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:43,260
up areas in the in the very core and the

1401
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,660
return of activities there so a regular

1402
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,180
a regular regulations perspective is

1403
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,940
also kind of what Dory Massey will be

1404
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,700
talking about she was a famous economic

1405
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,220
geographers economic geographer from

1406
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,799
1980s and she was also one of the main

1407
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,500
critical voices and trying to understand

1408
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,039
how particular forms of capitalism leave

1409
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,640
their imprint on society in general and

1410
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,559
on Urban Societies in particular she was

1411
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,020
interested in regions but it also can be

1412
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,160
applied

1413
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,359
um to cities so yeah you had a really uh

1414
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:21,480
a very hierarchical Society in general I

1415
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,039
mean there's a huge generalization here

1416
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,039
in medieval cities where the core was an

1417
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:28,799
elite realm uh with some domestic

1418
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,839
servants then there was a kind of a

1419
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:32,579
layer of the lower classes and then

1420
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:34,380
basically the outcasts with the number

1421
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,660
of ethnic communities this I mean

1422
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,940
there's a huge generalization but it's

1423
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,420
kind of a guiding model uh that is it's

1424
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,960
it's set to hold when you think about

1425
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,579
industrializing cities it was kind of

1426
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:50,220
thing and this is uh Chicago for sure

1427
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:52,920
and we'll be talking with Nick more

1428
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,799
about Chicago as it became a model of of

1429
01:07:55,799 --> 01:07:58,079
the industrial city in the early 20th

1430
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,839
century uh a lot of industrial activity

1431
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:03,000
in the commercial

1432
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,480
um Heart of the City and then radiating

1433
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,020
out uh in terms of you could say classes

1434
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,900
working men's houses and then further on

1435
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,679
more Elite cities people neighborhoods

1436
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:18,000
people that could actually afford to

1437
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,238
commute to the city center

1438
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:24,420
then after the second world war if you

1439
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,399
look at the bottom left it's a kind of

1440
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,920
the poorest city where capitalism was

1441
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,560
regulated in a particular way where the

1442
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,679
Surplus that was being created by

1443
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:36,719
capitalist production think about all

1444
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,540
these factories mass production was

1445
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,580
being shared by the working class so

1446
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,080
this is kind of the typical American

1447
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:46,020
dream it typifies American cities but it

1448
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,299
depends also to provide European cities

1449
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:50,299
where we had a massive round of

1450
01:08:50,299 --> 01:08:54,060
suburbanization uh the good life where

1451
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:57,120
you could live far removed from

1452
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,920
um from where you worked

1453
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,880
compute by car and it was a way to kind

1454
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,279
of spatially redistribute the surface

1455
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,439
that was being generated in cities okay

1456
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,960
that's a kind of a Harvard David

1457
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,359
harveying interpretation of

1458
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:14,939
suburbanization is not just a lifestyle

1459
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:17,339
it's also a spatial form of how

1460
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:21,179
capitalism uh of in that period worked

1461
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:22,198
okay

1462
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:24,719
and then kind of finally

1463
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,719
um this kind of growth at the periphery

1464
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:30,899
we see a kind of an outward movement you

1465
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:33,540
can say the urbanization of Suburbia all

1466
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,698
kinds of knowledge identity activities

1467
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:38,819
that are starting to take place at the

1468
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:42,238
edges a lot of City centers that are

1469
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:45,060
losing functions this kind of historical

1470
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,100
process in the 70s and 80s a lot of

1471
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,219
derelict areas Brownfield areas which

1472
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,500
are then in the subsequent decades

1473
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,600
increasingly becoming the places where

1474
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,360
you have waves of gentrification a

1475
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,600
return of capital uh to City centers etc

1476
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,719
etc

1477
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,580
all this and I'm trying to hugely

1478
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,860
summarize and generalize here because

1479
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:12,000
it's a kind of Ideal typical approach

1480
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
um diversity that is increasing in a lot

1481
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,300
of cities new pockets of exclusiveness

1482
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,420
and exclusion on the other hand so

1483
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,400
cities also becoming increasingly

1484
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:28,020
polarized Etc so the urban is is

1485
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,679
different depending on the period you're

1486
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,600
talking about it could be characterized

1487
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,600
differently depending on where you are

1488
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,760
and in what period you're talking about

1489
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,800
[Music]

1490
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,420
bottom left and right

1491
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,940
yeah you could say that I mean

1492
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,400
um in some handbooks it would be called

1493
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,820
the Ford City this one and this would be

1494
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,600
the post for this city which is kind of

1495
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,760
exopolis there's not one and

1496
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,699
identifiable Horror in the metropolitan

1497
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:07,500
area

1498
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,320
um whereas this was still very much in

1499
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,239
relation before but it captures the

1500
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,540
difference you could call it modernity

1501
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:18,659
um yes but that's more referred to you

1502
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:21,739
could say a discussion of planning

1503
01:11:21,739 --> 01:11:25,320
approaches uh modernist planning for

1504
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,120
instance where it was okay we're going

1505
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,659
to organize the city in zones here is

1506
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:32,699
residential function here we have

1507
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:35,280
industrial function but but you're right

1508
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,199
in that sense especially in the Forest

1509
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,159
City it was uh at the larger scale

1510
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,980
managed like that and it was also where

1511
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,460
a lot of urbanists come to reaction uh

1512
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:51,060
was launched against uh later on

1513
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,020
um

1514
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,199
think about the figure of Jane Jacobs

1515
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:57,300
who basically said well with Mother's

1516
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,580
Fleming this hand there's a top-down

1517
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,560
approach doesn't have anything to do

1518
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,320
with with urban life in us and of its

1519
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,360
own so we have to take stock of that to

1520
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,860
start thinking about a different way of

1521
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,060
planning so

1522
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,400
modernism would be a marker I would say

1523
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,520
of uh again yeah of urban Society but

1524
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,980
also about planning Traditions uh that

1525
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:20,600
have produced before this city

1526
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:23,460
and then another way and this wasn't

1527
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:27,300
really mentioned is yeah the urban or

1528
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,880
the city is also kind of a projector of

1529
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,920
symbolic power

1530
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,699
um

1531
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:36,600
it sends a message to the world and this

1532
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,020
is becoming uh I mean goes back to the

1533
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,380
20 the 12th and the 13th century where

1534
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:46,860
uh the evil cities and Flanders had the

1535
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,260
highest wanted to have the highest

1536
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:52,500
building or some jiminiano in the 14th

1537
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,540
century and Northern Italy

1538
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,380
um

1539
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,980
had something to do with corporate power

1540
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,840
Merchant power but also showing the

1541
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,900
Liberties of cities vis-a-vis uh

1542
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,000
territorial states which were then still

1543
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,760
feudal states in the Middle Ages

1544
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,620
you see that this is becoming much more

1545
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,199
globalized and that's the content of

1546
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,719
these messages is also very diverse you

1547
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:18,960
have the CCTV building in Beijing which

1548
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,300
is some kind of a representation of if

1549
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,880
it's authoritarian power of the Chinese

1550
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,699
Central State over China but also extra

1551
01:13:29,699 --> 01:13:32,340
territorially as the World Trade Center

1552
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,960
and

1553
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,940
yeah we I don't think we need to

1554
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,280
deconstruct that and I mean there's a

1555
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,199
lot of images

1556
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:40,980
um

1557
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:43,800
I mean about acclaimed imperialism by

1558
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,440
the US which was fasted in the

1559
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,719
commercial uh interests or the

1560
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,880
commercial power of the superpower of

1561
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,500
the US

1562
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,100
um which then also became uh a symbol of

1563
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,980
uh of Oppression if you will and made it

1564
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:03,060
a a target for uh for attacks

1565
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:06,900
um as we all know so it's it's a highly

1566
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:11,880
contested uh or arbitrary symbol there

1567
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,199
and often it's also kind of used in

1568
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,820
speculative

1569
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:20,699
developments you could say uh Khalifa in

1570
01:14:20,699 --> 01:14:23,400
the Middle East and Dubai

1571
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,920
um it's kind of part of a wider process

1572
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,480
of say

1573
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,960
ing Supply sites economics where it's

1574
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,560
really about building capacity building

1575
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,420
state-of-the-art infrastructure with the

1576
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,640
idea that it will attract business and

1577
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,219
others will in the end

1578
01:14:40,219 --> 01:14:44,100
drive drive growth to buy an Emirates

1579
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:47,460
without oil or where oil has run out

1580
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:49,820
through the 60s has had this

1581
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:52,739
diversification strategy and it has been

1582
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:55,140
to some extent a kind of self-fulfilling

1583
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:59,040
prophecy uh so yeah it's kind of a token

1584
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,860
of importance of centrality that is

1585
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,920
being proclaimed there it also is a

1586
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,020
token of other things a huge

1587
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,600
exploitation of temporary labor for

1588
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,000
instance but it is typically the Dark

1589
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,520
Side of these kind of uh buildings that

1590
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,460
is less uh discussed so it's part of

1591
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,800
spectacular urbanism makes us wonder

1592
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,880
what what is behind uh this image so

1593
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,340
yeah symbolic power has also kind of

1594
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:31,340
projected uh by certain kind of cities

1595
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,140
um and then maybe a final definition is

1596
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:36,060
indeed yeah the administrative

1597
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,659
definition

1598
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:41,520
um it has is a certain yeah

1599
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,340
um jurisdiction within a country it's

1600
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,500
the way where all kinds of management

1601
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,780
processes are administered but the

1602
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,880
population is serviced but how the

1603
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,460
public sector organizes itself and what

1604
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,020
is kind of interesting is that there's a

1605
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,520
lot of kind of

1606
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,880
um historical and accuracy

1607
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,840
um yeah aberrations almost uh when you

1608
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,820
take for instance the example of of

1609
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,640
medicine uh in West Flanders I put an

1610
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,340
arrow there for those who don't know uh

1611
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:14,580
Belgium that well it has about 1 000

1612
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:17,880
population in 2019 but it counts as a

1613
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,860
city yeah so it's kind of a historical

1614
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,080
artifact

1615
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:22,739
um

1616
01:16:22,739 --> 01:16:25,860
it used to be a very important

1617
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,320
um trading center for broadcloth if

1618
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,540
you've ever been to Bruges that was was

1619
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,699
kind of the main

1620
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:34,679
um main kind of produce that was kind of

1621
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:38,699
uh traded there Bridges was 40 000 k at

1622
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:40,620
that time so a fifth of the size of

1623
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,860
world City bridges in I think the 13th

1624
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,260
century so what is a very small

1625
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,480
community now was there there and then

1626
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,719
an important city and somehow Mason has

1627
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:54,480
kept its City rights and would still

1628
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,380
count as a city in un uh in U.N language

1629
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,739
okay so just to show that we should

1630
01:17:01,739 --> 01:17:04,460
probably be very wary about

1631
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,380
about these classifications because they

1632
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:12,440
can be uh quite misleading okay

1633
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:21,120
for the number of people living there or

1634
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,500
um that's a good question I didn't know

1635
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,880
it by heart that it would be a

1636
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,280
combination of of

1637
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,560
of many things it would be indeed uh

1638
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,980
size of the population I think

1639
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:35,100
um yeah more more morphological

1640
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,620
um character characteristics typically

1641
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,360
it would be

1642
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:39,980
um

1643
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:42,719
continuous built up areas

1644
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,159
uh

1645
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,900
um and then included in that

1646
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,760
some definition of a percentage of

1647
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,580
people commuting to the poor City so

1648
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:56,760
areas that are still dependent uh on the

1649
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,679
core City because they're part of an

1650
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:01,500
integrated labor market so I don't know

1651
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,659
it by heart but there's kind of the the

1652
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:05,520
agglomeration and then the bond here

1653
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,500
which is gives a kind of an another

1654
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:12,120
territory of that so and then

1655
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,620
um that's basically what they call

1656
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:16,199
functional urban areas that the kind of

1657
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:19,739
definition that is that people would use

1658
01:18:19,739 --> 01:18:22,260
yeah and I think maybe there's also

1659
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,719
something app to the part in becoming

1660
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:25,920
school because I know what they're made

1661
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,440
for example my appointment is my city it

1662
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,420
never got similar rights okay so maybe

1663
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,940
they just never requested anyways and

1664
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,820
maybe they didn't did they did Wells

1665
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:38,100
back in yeah

1666
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,500
yeah I think that that could indeed I I

1667
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,300
don't know the ins and outs of that but

1668
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,159
I think indeed that could be a to be

1669
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,520
part of the process as well yeah

1670
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,639
[Music]

1671
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:56,520
yeah they try to come up with some kind

1672
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,620
of a standardization on the criteria

1673
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:01,199
that I was mentioning so it's a yeah how

1674
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,239
many people live there

1675
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,520
morphological continuity and then you

1676
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,040
could say economic relations

1677
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,560
but especially when the um with the

1678
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,900
population threshold there's a huge

1679
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,960
fabrication some countries it would be 1

1680
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:20,600
000 and others it would be ten thousands

1681
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,080
um I think they do because Belgium does

1682
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,020
so um so that's kind of the irony yeah

1683
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:31,260
and that gets lost in when you look at

1684
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,120
the urbanization rates of 200 plus

1685
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,719
countries you can't look into that but

1686
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,880
the point by by Brendan Schmidt is that

1687
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,980
even if you solve that and come to a

1688
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,199
standardized definition you're still not

1689
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,239
out of the woods because it's it could

1690
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,159
still

1691
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:49,440
create all kinds of chaotic uh

1692
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,659
conceptions because the urban is not the

1693
01:19:51,659 --> 01:19:54,600
same as the city okay so that was kind

1694
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,600
of uh was the point okay so I hope yeah

1695
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,840
there's a number of perspectives here

1696
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:01,560
um

1697
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,040
there's not one size fits all answer to

1698
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,020
what the urban and the city is but

1699
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:09,540
there's different ways of of approaching

1700
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:12,679
the theme okay

1701
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,360
now

1702
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,860
um

1703
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:19,260
one definition that we could still use

1704
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,659
and there's also one that is used in the

1705
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:24,659
handbook is kind of very generically at

1706
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:26,580
the abstract level it's obviously

1707
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:28,800
urbanization is the process of becoming

1708
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,060
Urban

1709
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,640
and it refers at the abstract level to

1710
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,739
demographic process where increasingly

1711
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:35,659
people

1712
01:20:35,659 --> 01:20:38,159
live in that and more more and more

1713
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:39,179
density

1714
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:40,620
it has something to do with the

1715
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:43,860
globalization of uh

1716
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:47,100
uh of urban uh influence be it economic

1717
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,100
political cultural yeah it's kind of

1718
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,900
these places that matter

1719
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,900
and obviously this this Frame of the

1720
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:58,140
urban age is mobilized there

1721
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,300
and it's a call for

1722
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,360
starting to look into how cities are

1723
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,300
connected to the wider process of Urban

1724
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,920
Development

1725
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,320
and this is also connecting back to this

1726
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,260
notion of planetary urbanization

1727
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:16,560
by Brenner and Schmidt in a sense what

1728
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,940
they argue is that while cities may not

1729
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:23,880
populate the entire Earth they're

1730
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,719
actually

1731
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:27,900
quite delineated still if you produce a

1732
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:28,739
map

1733
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:31,980
you can't say that the entire uh global

1734
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,860
map is urban uh maybe a lot of people

1735
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:36,780
live in cities but still it wouldn't be

1736
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:38,540
a totality

1737
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:43,500
whereas the urban as a process as a way

1738
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,659
of living as a system of capitalist

1739
01:21:45,659 --> 01:21:49,140
production would be almost a totality

1740
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:52,380
and in planetary urbanization captures

1741
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:55,260
actually the fact that even when you go

1742
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,840
as far as as possible from the urban

1743
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,719
context from cities

1744
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,360
it would still lead back to these cities

1745
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,400
one way or another so the exploitation

1746
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,179
of seabeds in the North Atlantic it's

1747
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:12,480
absolutely absolutely not uh has not the

1748
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,300
characteristics of cities but it's

1749
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,500
part of a uh of exploitation processes

1750
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,320
that are commanded through uh through

1751
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,719
cities so it's a an example of what they

1752
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,380
call extensive urbanization whereas

1753
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,600
intensive urbanization in their mind

1754
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,179
would be the morphology of cities so

1755
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:36,440
it's a kind of sociological imaginary of

1756
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,780
urbanization As It All Leads back to

1757
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:42,600
cities one way or another whereas a more

1758
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,239
geographical imagination would start

1759
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:47,280
with well we can still remunerate

1760
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,400
certain places as being more dense as

1761
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,100
being more urban than one another

1762
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,179
whereas we also have to see the

1763
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:56,640
connections with other things so

1764
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,280
that's just one more approach of looking

1765
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,440
at it

1766
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,820
we've been talking a little bit about

1767
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,800
urbanism because it's always a bit of

1768
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,060
confusion difference between

1769
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,980
urbanization which we've been talking

1770
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,380
about and urbanism

1771
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:13,320
um you have urbanists here it's it's not

1772
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,840
just about observing and analyzing

1773
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,940
breasts is also

1774
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:21,360
um designing cities and shaping cities

1775
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,460
in a particular way so urbanism is

1776
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:31,080
is uh Dimitri uh uh as the craft of

1777
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,480
actually designing cities to a certain

1778
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,900
end but it also connects to uh and

1779
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,159
that's perhaps also what you were

1780
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,260
talking about at some point gaining an

1781
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,120
urban attitude there's something of an

1782
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,760
energy of that particular society and

1783
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,239
cities refers to a particular

1784
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:51,600
psychological or sociological feeling uh

1785
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,640
that gives a particular meaning to a

1786
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,860
space and I already talked about the

1787
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:58,860
opposition between the ideal type of a

1788
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:02,280
community where this kind of warm social

1789
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,980
ties kicking things together versus a

1790
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,199
society where it's more abstract formal

1791
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:10,800
roles that are impersonal uh I think

1792
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,960
when you look at cities and the

1793
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,480
representations and the way the urban

1794
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,719
space is consumed you find a lot of that

1795
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,140
uh you could say societal

1796
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:25,860
um anonymity uh or that kind of detached

1797
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,100
element in those images and

1798
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,800
when you look at yeah especially in the

1799
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,360
19th century

1800
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,159
I mean when people start to capture

1801
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:38,699
process of modernity of urban modernity

1802
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,860
and with this idea of the figure of the

1803
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:43,380
fla nerve which was at the same time it

1804
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:46,620
was usually a he a Dandy a rich person

1805
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:49,020
that was both connected to cities

1806
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,000
because of his wealth and he had to show

1807
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,980
himself off but at the same time he was

1808
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:57,360
also a spectator a walker by Passion who

1809
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,400
consumed Urban space from in a very

1810
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,920
Anonymous and detached way and

1811
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,020
especially in the 19th century I mean we

1812
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,699
have this Gallery here close to the

1813
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:06,980
ground Plus

1814
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:10,380
in Brussels it was a kind of urban space

1815
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,600
was designed for this Anonymous

1816
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,780
consumption was was all about Collective

1817
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:18,780
spectacular consumption and in many ways

1818
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,280
Urban Design

1819
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:23,340
especially when we start to Rebrand our

1820
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:24,960
city centers

1821
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,960
goes back to these forms of of urban

1822
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,060
consumption if you think about these

1823
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:34,800
renderings of uh on Spock Boulevard or

1824
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,260
if you look at renderings of how uh

1825
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:39,360
Philippine campus will look like in 10

1826
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,880
years it has this kind of spectacular

1827
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,640
element always to it that's that

1828
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,100
protects a particular kind of urban

1829
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,880
attitude that is there to consume Urban

1830
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,219
space to work

1831
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:56,880
so Urban Design it's about

1832
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:57,780
um

1833
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:00,600
they're really giving shape to Urban

1834
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,239
spaces but also capturing how people

1835
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:06,239
interact with psychologically and

1836
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,860
sociologically with the built

1837
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:11,000
environment especially within urbanism

1838
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,260
for for instance environmental

1839
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,960
psychology and that is a a very

1840
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,219
important team

1841
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,219
planning is

1842
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:25,620
a future oriented activity in which acts

1843
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,300
as various types engaged so that they

1844
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,400
can govern how development will take

1845
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,380
place so

1846
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,380
um obviously

1847
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,239
economic process societal process don't

1848
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,880
just unfold in and of themselves it's a

1849
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,520
kind of uh process of being mediated by

1850
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,280
a particular planning cultures I mean we

1851
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,980
talked about zoning before it's about

1852
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:49,760
giving a place to certain activities

1853
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,100
making choices of where things should be

1854
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,080
developed and it's actually quite a

1855
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,900
power Laden process because development

1856
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,239
in one place could mean non-development

1857
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:03,120
in another place where do jobs where are

1858
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,120
jobs being creative where do they not

1859
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,520
and how do certain planning procedures

1860
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,420
start to to tackle uh process of uneven

1861
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,340
development or under development within

1862
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,199
the city and especially in a city like

1863
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:18,239
Brussels

1864
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:21,120
one of the main you could say folki off

1865
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,280
of urban planning

1866
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,100
um in the regional plan has been the

1867
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:29,600
Canal Zone it was kind of a prioritary

1868
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,420
space which needed to be redeveloped in

1869
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,360
one way it's a well we'll be looking

1870
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,659
into the social geography of this place

1871
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:41,460
uh and and throughout the course but

1872
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,920
also as we go on excursions it's an

1873
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,020
ethnically diverse typically lower

1874
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:47,940
income neighborhood with a lot of

1875
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:51,360
unemployment and it's also very much a

1876
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,100
zone of transitions a lot of things

1877
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,199
happening there Redevelopment and

1878
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:58,080
planning is not neutral there

1879
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,940
um there has been a large focus on this

1880
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:03,860
area both in terms of trying to achieve

1881
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:06,420
industrial Redevelopment because there

1882
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:09,480
was a lot of unemployment kind of a

1883
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:12,300
rollout of a zone of economic expansion

1884
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,639
that was installed there

1885
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,639
at the same time also the ambition to

1886
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:22,080
achieve mixity to increase the mixing of

1887
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,480
residential and and

1888
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,139
um and and workings okay

1889
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:30,960
and what is kind of interesting there in

1890
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,540
in Brussels is that there was a very big

1891
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:36,300
contradiction between the ambition to

1892
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,300
attract uh businesses to this area and

1893
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,940
create jobs and the ambition of mixer

1894
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:44,580
team because mix City worked as a kind

1895
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,920
of an incentive for all of residential

1896
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:50,340
developers to start building

1897
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:53,340
um yeah high-end or

1898
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:57,060
I would say regionally unaffordable uh

1899
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:00,780
Apartments house etc etc so

1900
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:04,620
the idea of let's mix stuff is actually

1901
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,480
making

1902
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,120
um The Return of jobs to this area

1903
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,580
very difficult it leads to forms of

1904
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,300
industrial gentrification

1905
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:17,639
and it's also leading to some kind of an

1906
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:20,040
affordability crisis because the types

1907
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,659
of houses that are being produced there

1908
01:29:21,659 --> 01:29:24,659
has nothing to do with what the local

1909
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:27,679
residents would actually need okay so

1910
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:30,360
that's housing production but it's not

1911
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,420
tailored to the demand if you will

1912
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:37,860
so yes uh planning plays a role

1913
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:43,100
um and it's all but a neutral process

1914
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,280
now what is geography

1915
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,500
you have one minute to discuss this and

1916
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,480
geographers I'm looking at you to

1917
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,739
explain what geography is

1918
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,460
because I can't

1919
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:01,400
please discuss what is geography

1920
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:07,460
foreign

1921
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:21,720
[Music]

1922
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:43,520
[Music]

1923
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:53,049
[Music]

1924
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,060
yes

1925
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:06,120
you have an idea already

1926
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,880
it's not as I have to explain not the

1927
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,580
parts or branch of geology

1928
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,620
and receptions that's typically what I'm

1929
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,620
meeting up okay but um what's your idea

1930
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,900
about this

1931
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:21,900
mm-hmm

1932
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,800
and they were

1933
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:35,280
maybe total topology or

1934
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,280
the terrains like that or the nearby

1935
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,679
services

1936
01:31:40,679 --> 01:31:41,699
so

1937
01:31:41,699 --> 01:31:44,520
where a particular location is

1938
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,620
okay so it's about location it's about

1939
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:49,440
the impact of you could say the terrain

1940
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,900
on activities and those kind of things

1941
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:56,659
oh yeah okay thank you

1942
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
um

1943
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:08,239
particular like areas on sale

1944
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:11,600
like

1945
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:16,199
geology for example okay

1946
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:19,260
geography is the study of space I mean I

1947
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,780
can be applied to anything so it doesn't

1948
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:23,219
matter what you're studying if you want

1949
01:32:23,219 --> 01:32:26,100
to be looking at a scale then that's

1950
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,400
okay

1951
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,020
that gives us tremendous power as

1952
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:34,520
geographers thank you for that

1953
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:40,400
thank you for that any other ideas yeah

1954
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:52,739
so dialectics between humans and the

1955
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:54,900
environment okay

1956
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,360
other ideas yeah

1957
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,360
foreign

1958
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,560
[Music]

1959
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:32,940
like to say for example sometimes it to

1960
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,560
faculty

1961
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,400
you think so special approach

1962
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,400
that's very interesting yeah and your

1963
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,980
idea is still

1964
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:47,760
okay I think I think there's all I would

1965
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,219
say correct in a way but it shows that

1966
01:33:50,219 --> 01:33:51,840
there's different different answers to

1967
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,300
this question and the answer to this

1968
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,100
question has been different throughout

1969
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,280
the history of geography uh I would say

1970
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,620
in the 19th century it was indeed about

1971
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:04,560
creating detailed information on

1972
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,840
resources topography and those kind of

1973
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,300
things because geography was installed

1974
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:12,420
in an imperial program of exploiting the

1975
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:17,040
colonies but throughout the decades uh

1976
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,560
the main purpose or less on depth of

1977
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,780
geography has shifted

1978
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,659
or there's different kind of parallel

1979
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,400
interpretations of what the purpose of

1980
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,139
geography should be

1981
01:34:28,139 --> 01:34:30,679
I start with a number of

1982
01:34:30,679 --> 01:34:33,600
definitions where else do we go the real

1983
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,540
Royal geographical Society this is this

1984
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:40,020
kind of the heart of Empire if you will

1985
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:41,580
um one of the first geographical

1986
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:44,460
Societies in the kind of part of the

1987
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:48,120
British Empire as it's a kind of ruled

1988
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:51,480
disease and it gives us some idea of

1989
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,540
what geography could be so it's

1990
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:56,460
the understanding of Social and physical

1991
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:58,500
processes within the context plays

1992
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,179
recognizing the great differences in

1993
01:35:00,179 --> 01:35:01,860
cultures political systems economies

1994
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:03,480
Landscapes and environments across the

1995
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,980
world and exploring things between them

1996
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:08,580
so it's about the the world as a mosaic

1997
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,760
it's about geographical difference

1998
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:13,580
sensitivity to contexts

1999
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:17,580
and also thinking relationally so how

2000
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:20,580
does something that happens in Brussels

2001
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,280
connects to Kinshasa for instance so

2002
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,199
it's about connections between places

2003
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:27,600
but these are not I mean I'm not saying

2004
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,239
these are ideal definitions

2005
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:33,420
by far not but we can be inspired and

2006
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,280
fix certain things from

2007
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:38,159
American Association of geographers used

2008
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,540
to be the association of American

2009
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:42,120
geographers by the way but they changed

2010
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:44,520
their name to reflect more diverse

2011
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:48,480
audience uh in the community

2012
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,460
you want to understand the world's final

2013
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:52,860
start with the River City a mountain a

2014
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,840
village a road and follow it to the ends

2015
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,940
of the Earth geography asked the big

2016
01:35:56,940 --> 01:36:01,020
questions where how why what if as you

2017
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:02,940
were saying and gives you the

2018
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:04,920
perspective to answer them with advanced

2019
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,719
technology and the solid knowledge of

2020
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,659
the world in which we all live okay so

2021
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:12,719
follow your nose Trace connections uh

2022
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:15,540
and indeed ask these big questions where

2023
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:18,420
perhaps in other disciplines

2024
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:22,739
um there's less space to do so okay

2025
01:36:22,739 --> 01:36:25,199
by the way if you go to the original you

2026
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:27,659
could say literal Greek transcription is

2027
01:36:27,659 --> 01:36:30,540
Earth description

2028
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:33,000
um but that doesn't tell you that much

2029
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,820
right it's a standard definition would

2030
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:39,960
be to describe uh human activity at the

2031
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:43,020
interface of uh and with with the Earth

2032
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:46,139
or something like that so it somehow

2033
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:48,840
goes back to a very descriptive idea of

2034
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:51,719
what geography should be uh not

2035
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:54,060
necessarily producing any analytical

2036
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:57,120
knowledge or explanatory knowledge okay

2037
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,780
so I tend to not to like that definition

2038
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:02,699
too much but

2039
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:05,639
in original Greek it's what it means

2040
01:37:05,639 --> 01:37:06,780
okay

2041
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:09,239
now to further a little bit there and I

2042
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:11,340
think I mean this going a little bit

2043
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:12,780
more

2044
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:15,000
um towards my own expectation as well

2045
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,040
just another quote

2046
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,260
uh take from the handbook While most

2047
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:21,120
social science disciplines can be

2048
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,820
roughly defined by what they study the

2049
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:25,500
economy culture society and so on

2050
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,719
geography is defined by how we stand so

2051
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:29,940
that was what you were saying

2052
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,980
and so the World by our approach

2053
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,719
geographers study the economy Society

2054
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:35,699
politics and culture too but a

2055
01:37:35,699 --> 01:37:37,440
geographical perspective is one that

2056
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,500
emphasizes space it is approached to any

2057
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:43,020
of these subjects so it's not just that

2058
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:46,739
we can claim uh like political

2059
01:37:46,739 --> 01:37:49,380
scientists or like economists this kind

2060
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:52,260
of thematic field it's really our you

2061
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:55,440
could say theoretical and analytical

2062
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,980
working with the notion of space space

2063
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:02,040
as something that explains what human

2064
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:06,000
activity as it interacts with its

2065
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,080
environment that really

2066
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:12,060
identifies so sets us apart as

2067
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,159
geographers from us yeah just the

2068
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:15,360
questions the how is this definition

2069
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:18,139
that any difference from you know

2070
01:38:18,139 --> 01:38:21,300
sociology as a whole

2071
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,520
but because there would be far less

2072
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,020
attention to space

2073
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:26,639
I would say

2074
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,340
that's so childhood sociology isn't that

2075
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:31,320
space it's also defined how human

2076
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,120
interactions go

2077
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:36,920
like that the whole point is

2078
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:40,500
how space defines house I wouldn't think

2079
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,199
so I think sociologists would would

2080
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:46,380
start with particular yeah

2081
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,480
um histories perhaps look at the

2082
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,840
relations organizational forms uh

2083
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,179
perhaps identity those kind of processes

2084
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:57,120
but I think and they perhaps they may

2085
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,000
describe variety

2086
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,100
uh across different contexts in one way

2087
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:04,139
or another but perhaps they would not

2088
01:39:04,139 --> 01:39:08,159
use geography to explain uh

2089
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:12,659
those differences so for instance I mean

2090
01:39:12,659 --> 01:39:14,040
I mean what could I think of as an

2091
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,620
example I mean when you when you try to

2092
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:19,320
understand urban life

2093
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:22,080
uh being sensitive to how you're

2094
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:26,820
inserted uh in a Global Network of uh of

2095
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:29,280
cities could be

2096
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,080
um could be one way to appreciate your

2097
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,239
own positionality so if you're a citizen

2098
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:36,000
of a city like in Shasta which is an

2099
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,940
exploitative or subordinate relation to

2100
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:41,159
other cities in the world it may give

2101
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:43,500
you a hint of why your living conditions

2102
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:47,100
are that bad whereas sociologists May

2103
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:50,159
perhaps start explaining that from local

2104
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:52,980
cultures uh local societal

2105
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:55,500
characteristics political systems Etc a

2106
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,260
geographer would for instance try to put

2107
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,360
that in perspective and say look there's

2108
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,400
an overarching system

2109
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:05,100
a world system of sorts maybe we can

2110
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,639
talk about this next week that allows to

2111
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,620
explain uh that a little bit better

2112
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,179
okay I don't but I think yeah and that

2113
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:20,219
connects a little bit to the to the next

2114
01:40:20,219 --> 01:40:22,920
uh thing and the sociological

2115
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:26,280
imagination and these are the words uh I

2116
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,440
mean this is what what David Harvey

2117
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,780
writes and social justice in the city

2118
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,760
it enables the possessor to understand

2119
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,739
the larger historical scene in terms of

2120
01:40:34,739 --> 01:40:36,780
its meaning for inner life and external

2121
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:39,420
career a variety of individuals so the

2122
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,340
sociological imagination enables us to

2123
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,440
grasp history history and biography and

2124
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,000
the relation between the two in society

2125
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,460
so it's about think about issues like

2126
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:50,880
class and how knowledge is produced uh

2127
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,880
what kind of questions that you ask that

2128
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:56,040
are predefined for not predefined by

2129
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:59,639
shaped by our by your own class identity

2130
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:01,620
for instance or epic identity to

2131
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,960
acknowledge that would be one thing but

2132
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,639
Harvey says the spatial imagination

2133
01:41:05,639 --> 01:41:07,620
enables the individual to recognize the

2134
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:09,300
role of space and place in some

2135
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:12,719
biography so like for instance somebody

2136
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:15,739
from South Africa who starts teaching

2137
01:41:15,739 --> 01:41:18,500
in in London

2138
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,300
in

2139
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:22,560
as a geographer

2140
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,980
how with this personal trajectory uh

2141
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:28,920
lead to some kind of a focus on issues

2142
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,659
of what is modernity what is

2143
01:41:30,659 --> 01:41:33,060
non-modernity what is development what

2144
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:34,679
is under development and those kind of

2145
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:37,580
things so how for instance on a career

2146
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:40,380
as a scholar from the global South going

2147
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,239
to the global North might shape the

2148
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:44,340
questions that are being asked

2149
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:46,980
next to just issues of class ethnicity

2150
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:49,320
and other elements that may shape

2151
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,820
positionality

2152
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:52,679
I could use the example of Jennifer

2153
01:41:52,679 --> 01:41:54,960
Robinson for instance who fits this

2154
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,760
exercise and she came up with the idea

2155
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,060
of ordinary cities somehow debunking the

2156
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:01,980
whole idea that would be extraordinary

2157
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:06,119
world cities and then the rest okay so

2158
01:42:06,119 --> 01:42:08,040
just saying that in your personal

2159
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,960
biographies

2160
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:12,840
your spatial trajectory and your spatial

2161
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,119
relations with other places may also

2162
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,520
have an impact on the kind of questions

2163
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,460
uh that you're they're asking I'm not

2164
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:23,580
saying that uh sociologists are blind

2165
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:25,739
but they they just ask different kind of

2166
01:42:25,739 --> 01:42:26,699
questions

2167
01:42:26,699 --> 01:42:27,960
okay

2168
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:30,179
now for me I mean these are difficult

2169
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:32,100
theoretical discussions it's also not an

2170
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,560
epistemological

2171
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:36,960
epistemology class but I think it's safe

2172
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,659
to say that as as human geographers

2173
01:42:39,659 --> 01:42:42,179
we're interested in uh the interactions

2174
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:45,360
between space and Society how spaces

2175
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:48,179
shape societies and individuals and vice

2176
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:51,060
versa how individuals and societies

2177
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:54,000
space shape their environments and this

2178
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,980
is kind of what

2179
01:42:55,980 --> 01:43:00,119
at soja a famous uh American geographer

2180
01:43:00,119 --> 01:43:03,360
calls an association dialectic

2181
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,699
um and it's and then you translate that

2182
01:43:05,699 --> 01:43:09,360
to cities it's how Urban societies make

2183
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:12,300
the places they live in and at the same

2184
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,420
time how Urban space morphologically or

2185
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:18,480
otherwise has again back an influence on

2186
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,300
urban life as as groups and individuals

2187
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:24,719
think about segregation which shows a

2188
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:27,060
segregated social structure

2189
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:29,219
it's something social but it also will

2190
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:31,320
Define the kind of interactions that you

2191
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:34,260
have with others in urban space and they

2192
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:35,699
have an impact on what kind of

2193
01:43:35,699 --> 01:43:37,980
encounters you have in the city may have

2194
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,780
an impact on

2195
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,179
how privileged you are

2196
01:43:42,179 --> 01:43:45,659
um to what extent you know other social

2197
01:43:45,659 --> 01:43:48,719
groups and Society Etc so space one

2198
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:50,639
example that killing to the work of Nick

2199
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:51,780
later on

2200
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:54,840
that shows that space has in itself some

2201
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:57,360
kind of an autonomous form of

2202
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:01,199
uh explanation I'm very uh defensive as

2203
01:44:01,199 --> 01:44:03,840
a geographer as you can see because as

2204
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,000
all geographers I have an identity

2205
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,739
crisis

2206
01:44:07,739 --> 01:44:09,600
um but that's kind of a very productive

2207
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,340
one I would say because this kind of

2208
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:14,400
typifies the history of post-war history

2209
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,860
of geography and maybe other geographers

2210
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:19,380
will will recognize that

2211
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:21,960
um yeah so the social spatial dialectic

2212
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,360
perhaps this is as a synthesis what we

2213
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:27,420
can land on how society's people make

2214
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:29,460
spaces and how it works back to them and

2215
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,659
thinking about

2216
01:44:30,659 --> 01:44:34,320
the autonomous power of space and

2217
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:35,699
explaining stuff

2218
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:40,260
as an example if I can can I

2219
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:42,659
yes

2220
01:44:42,659 --> 01:44:44,639
four ways and I mean you mentioned it

2221
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:46,500
already it's thinking about different

2222
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:49,020
concepts of space territory scale

2223
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:51,900
networks plays are for common ways of

2224
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,880
thinking about space

2225
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:56,460
and they point to different kind of

2226
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:59,820
spatial processes and again it's not

2227
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:02,219
that one is better than the other to

2228
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:04,800
understand what is happening but as I

2229
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,100
will try to show by the example Brussels

2230
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:10,860
kind of seeking tension between these

2231
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:13,380
different concepts that get us gets us a

2232
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:15,780
little bit closer to understanding for

2233
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:18,239
instance in this case the conundrum that

2234
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:21,540
Brussels supposed so one way of looking

2235
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:25,139
at the city of Brussels is a territorial

2236
01:45:25,139 --> 01:45:27,540
one it has a particular jurisdiction

2237
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,940
it's the Brussels Capital Region which

2238
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,739
emerged as a region somewhere in the

2239
01:45:31,739 --> 01:45:35,520
1990s next to Flanders and malonia

2240
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,580
and it has certain competences it has a

2241
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:40,800
government a parliament we can do stuff

2242
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,440
besides stuff on its territory

2243
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,260
but not on culture because that's uh

2244
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,840
something that is being decided by

2245
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,540
flowers and the francophone Community

2246
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:54,300
but other than that there's kind of

2247
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:57,600
sovereignty uh on that level uh as what

2248
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,460
can be designed so it's a very strict

2249
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:02,520
kind of banded space if you walk 10

2250
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:05,040
meters outside those boundaries in

2251
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,260
principle uh the Brussels government

2252
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:10,080
can't say anything about you

2253
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:13,139
um and on the other hand it's also can

2254
01:46:13,139 --> 01:46:15,900
erect all kinds of barriers if Flanders

2255
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:18,659
wants to add another Lane to the Ring

2256
01:46:18,659 --> 01:46:21,179
Road across Brussels because it is very

2257
01:46:21,179 --> 01:46:23,699
centered on on car Mobility

2258
01:46:23,699 --> 01:46:25,860
well there's ways of blocking that

2259
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:27,179
because

2260
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:29,219
um there's certain stretches of the Ring

2261
01:46:29,219 --> 01:46:31,980
Road where Brussels can say no let's not

2262
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,960
do that here and in the end you end up

2263
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:36,000
still with the bottlenecks okay so this

2264
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,760
is territorial power to some extent uh

2265
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,460
which has also been used uh by the

2266
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:43,580
Brussels government saying everything

2267
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:47,580
is 50 kilometers an hour max When you

2268
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:51,420
entered the depart territory uh so yeah

2269
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:54,179
um take it or leave it

2270
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:55,980
so with territorial view of what

2271
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:58,260
Brussels could be a second one it would

2272
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,840
be a more scalar View

2273
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,619
and scale

2274
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:07,159
to

2275
01:47:07,159 --> 01:47:09,600
different processes work on different

2276
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,400
scales some of them are really micro

2277
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:14,460
teaching is a micro process taking place

2278
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:17,219
in the at the scale here of the

2279
01:47:17,219 --> 01:47:19,400
classroom

2280
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,840
whereas you could say commuting is

2281
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,239
something that takes place at a far

2282
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,280
larger scale as we go home it's a

2283
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:29,820
process That's radically goes beyond the

2284
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:32,340
boundaries of of this class okay it's

2285
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:33,960
the same when you look at economic

2286
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,940
activities

2287
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:37,500
um as you if you look at the

2288
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,739
Metropolitan Area morphologically

2289
01:47:39,739 --> 01:47:43,440
Brussels is actually much larger than

2290
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:46,199
the Brussels Capital Region so if we

2291
01:47:46,199 --> 01:47:49,260
were to Define Brussels as a scale of

2292
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:52,260
where Urban activities take place

2293
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:56,159
you could end up halfway to Flanders or

2294
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:58,739
halfway to Bologna okay so it radically

2295
01:47:58,739 --> 01:48:00,480
deep borders

2296
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,159
um the territory that is the Brussels

2297
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:03,600
capital region

2298
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:07,139
in contrast to other contexts

2299
01:48:07,139 --> 01:48:09,960
um there has not been a very uh

2300
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:12,960
successful process of we could say City

2301
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,900
regionalization where there was some

2302
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,179
kind of

2303
01:48:17,179 --> 01:48:20,219
governance expansion to manage the

2304
01:48:20,219 --> 01:48:22,440
Metropolitan uh process and a lot of

2305
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,960
context we see that new governance

2306
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,760
structures have been erected think about

2307
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:28,560
London for instance

2308
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:32,100
uh it hugely exceeds uh the original

2309
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,020
Heartland of London but includes more

2310
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:36,000
and more of its peripheries because

2311
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,119
these places are connected to

2312
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,820
um to the urban area okay this is not

2313
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:43,380
what happened in Brussels and this has

2314
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:46,139
something to do with the fact that

2315
01:48:46,139 --> 01:48:49,199
there's a very communitarian uh

2316
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:51,540
sensitive issue okay because it deals

2317
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:53,340
with all kinds of issues of

2318
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:57,179
redistribution of uh of income Etc we

2319
01:48:57,179 --> 01:48:59,580
have to keep in mind that about 60 of

2320
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:03,300
Belgian GDP is generated in Brussels uh

2321
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:06,119
but it's not being governed into in its

2322
01:49:06,119 --> 01:49:08,639
totality by the Brussels government

2323
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:10,739
in fact and that brings us to the third

2324
01:49:10,739 --> 01:49:13,560
one it's a network perspective

2325
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,260
there's all kinds of micro networks in

2326
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,239
this case this is the commuting map of

2327
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,940
Belgium that makes that the Surplus that

2328
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:22,560
is being generated by all these

2329
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,960
activities and Brussels I think about

2330
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,239
headquarter functions European functions

2331
01:49:27,239 --> 01:49:29,639
that apparently account for a quarter of

2332
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:32,520
the Brussels economy it actually leaks

2333
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,520
to the periphery so it leaks beyond the

2334
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,080
borders of this territory of the

2335
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,600
Brussels Capital Region a lot of people

2336
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:45,179
including myself work in Brussels but

2337
01:49:45,179 --> 01:49:49,679
um basically pay taxes outside of

2338
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:52,500
Brussels so I live in against this

2339
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,380
beautiful other city

2340
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:58,619
in Belgium and I yeah I get texts and

2341
01:49:58,619 --> 01:50:01,920
Flanders uh I spent a lot of money well

2342
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,020
not so much because I work too much I

2343
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:07,320
could spend a lot of money in Ghent

2344
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:09,239
um but it basically is some kind of

2345
01:50:09,239 --> 01:50:12,420
physical leakage from uh from territory

2346
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:13,460
right

2347
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:17,100
and uh this is a problem with Brussels

2348
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:19,800
we also could talk about uh eurocrats

2349
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:23,040
who are not taxed at all but work in

2350
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,500
Brussels so we can wonder about the

2351
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,420
multiplier economic multiplier that's

2352
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:29,100
being created by all these activities in

2353
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,320
Brussels and that means that yeah

2354
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,480
there's a lot of a large visiting class

2355
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:36,239
about 400 000 commuters come to Brussels

2356
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:40,260
every uh every day well pre-corona let's

2357
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:41,820
see if it's still the case

2358
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:45,480
uh but they use a city they spend uh

2359
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:47,639
time on on the infrastructure but not

2360
01:50:47,639 --> 01:50:50,159
necessarily paying for that

2361
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:52,500
and now it's very details of other kinds

2362
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:55,320
of ways of arranging that as solidarity

2363
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,480
than between the regions of flounders

2364
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,580
for instance space

2365
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:01,920
um a number of buildings every year to

2366
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,860
Brussels as a sign of solidarity where

2367
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:07,380
you can also frame it as just paying the

2368
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:09,239
bill for being on the Metro in Brussels

2369
01:51:09,239 --> 01:51:12,719
using it every day and so this kind of a

2370
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,780
discussion there

2371
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:17,780
and it also is framed in very

2372
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:22,080
identitarian communitarian terms

2373
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,179
and this is kind of when you use a

2374
01:51:24,179 --> 01:51:26,520
concept like place

2375
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:27,119
um

2376
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:29,460
gets you a bit closer to this process of

2377
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:31,739
how people attach meanings to some place

2378
01:51:31,739 --> 01:51:34,380
so Brussels and how it's represented in

2379
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:36,659
Belgian Media or Flemish media I invite

2380
01:51:36,659 --> 01:51:41,460
you to uh buy a Flemish newspaper and

2381
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:43,739
run it through Google to see how

2382
01:51:43,739 --> 01:51:45,600
Brussels is being represented as a

2383
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,340
particular frame

2384
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:50,780
um which has been augmented uh or

2385
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:54,659
centralized even further as we had the

2386
01:51:54,659 --> 01:51:57,540
terrorist attacks in 2016

2387
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:01,260
um where even Mr former president Trump

2388
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:03,739
describe to normal and big as a hellhole

2389
01:52:03,739 --> 01:52:06,960
and was very nicely taken over by

2390
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:08,639
Flemish media because it kind of

2391
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:11,119
resonates with the idea of yeah

2392
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:12,920
unsafe

2393
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:16,260
image of Brussels

2394
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:17,119
um

2395
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:20,159
dirty image of Brussels

2396
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:20,880
um

2397
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:23,580
and yeah so it kind of resonates there

2398
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:26,100
and what you see is especially is that

2399
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:28,199
yeah this is also you could say

2400
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:30,540
reenacted in the in the entire covet

2401
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:33,300
crisis where again it's the same frame

2402
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:36,480
of yeah Brussels can't manage look at

2403
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,820
vaccination rates it doesn't get its

2404
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:40,500
population under control they're messing

2405
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,199
up again if we were independent and

2406
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:44,540
flounders

2407
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:47,760
yeah that we could be have all kinds of

2408
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,340
other covet regulations etc etc would be

2409
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:53,280
free already so it's kind of this Frame

2410
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,040
of attaching certain meanings uh to

2411
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:58,760
certain places so if you just go to

2412
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:02,580
lidocack or you could also like they'll

2413
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:05,820
be it's a big sign but flaming and

2414
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:07,980
Thursday so it's

2415
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:09,619
it's

2416
01:53:09,619 --> 01:53:13,320
yeah I would say somewhere here

2417
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:16,679
so it's really dependent on um

2418
01:53:16,679 --> 01:53:19,440
on Brussels in terms of commuting but

2419
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:22,080
what you see is that with the kind of

2420
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,340
um return

2421
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:26,400
of higher end residential functions the

2422
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,159
city uh to the city of Brussels that is

2423
01:53:29,159 --> 01:53:31,619
actually a lot of displacement going on

2424
01:53:31,619 --> 01:53:34,199
and a lot of people that used to live in

2425
01:53:34,199 --> 01:53:36,119
what they call the residual housing

2426
01:53:36,119 --> 01:53:37,800
market still affordable housing in

2427
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:40,460
Brussels it's actually being pushed out

2428
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:42,980
and is increasingly

2429
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:45,360
commuting to Brussels from further and

2430
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:48,719
further away so in a sense you could say

2431
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:51,780
um Brussels is spilling over all the way

2432
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:53,820
to leader character and what you see is

2433
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:55,440
that there is a very strong opposition

2434
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:59,639
by uh identitarian parties a local mayor

2435
01:53:59,639 --> 01:54:01,760
which has really tried to

2436
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:04,820
form a kind of a Bridgehead if you will

2437
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:08,780
towards all that is foreign

2438
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:16,980
uh to this process of urbanization there

2439
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:19,380
and we can think about it uh what what

2440
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:20,820
we want but it's certainly something

2441
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:23,219
that is that is explaining a lot of the

2442
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:26,460
tensions between Brussels and it's it's

2443
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:28,980
growing Hinterland

2444
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:32,100
so four takes of the Brussels to four

2445
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:34,080
different kind of spatial

2446
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:38,639
uh approaches and I think combining them

2447
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:41,639
tells us a bit more about what on Earth

2448
01:54:41,639 --> 01:54:45,600
Brussels as a city is

2449
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,760
um okay

2450
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,139
um

2451
01:54:49,139 --> 01:54:51,060
is there still time do you still have

2452
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:53,340
time for one minute of thinking about

2453
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:55,679
what being critical means

2454
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:58,199
I think in eight minutes we can stop so

2455
01:54:58,199 --> 01:54:59,639
one minute

2456
01:54:59,639 --> 01:55:03,119
of thinking of what is critical not in a

2457
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:05,100
sense your condition is critical but

2458
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:07,920
what is critical Urban studies or

2459
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,440
critical urban geography for you what

2460
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:13,100
does that mean

2461
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,360
um

2462
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:28,760
the countryside

2463
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:52,790
[Music]

2464
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:05,159
being critical

2465
01:56:05,159 --> 01:56:08,239
what does that mean

2466
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:11,719
the ideas

2467
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:25,199
are the absolute on the students

2468
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:28,199
yeah so yeah questioning what you hear

2469
01:56:28,199 --> 01:56:32,520
what you see okay okay

2470
01:56:33,239 --> 01:56:34,920
making sure

2471
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:36,900
all right

2472
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:40,580
people who are the person yeah

2473
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:44,940
so it connects a bit to what you were

2474
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:47,699
saying uh fact-checking certain

2475
01:56:47,699 --> 01:56:49,020
statements

2476
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:52,340
uh see where your ideas come from yeah

2477
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:55,520
just being aware of your own biases like

2478
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,080
confirmation bias sharing thinking about

2479
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:00,540
something it's a huge help with being

2480
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:02,880
critical as well cherry picking what is

2481
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,800
that can you explain that traffic is the

2482
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:10,139
selective picking of your sources

2483
01:57:10,139 --> 01:57:14,099
uh while you have Ida and you only code

2484
01:57:14,099 --> 01:57:17,040
source that also save others that also

2485
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,840
represent the idea it's regarding all

2486
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:21,179
the other end yeah so you go back from

2487
01:57:21,179 --> 01:57:23,639
the results to uh to the data selection

2488
01:57:23,639 --> 01:57:26,940
yeah yeah so being reflexive about your

2489
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:30,380
own ideas yes exactly

2490
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,080
required

2491
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:39,900
mm-hmm

2492
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:42,139
in the words

2493
01:57:42,139 --> 01:57:44,940
caring caring

2494
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:48,239
uh and and okay and and caring how how

2495
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:52,040
exactly that's an interesting term

2496
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,119
s

2497
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:55,619
and then

2498
01:57:55,619 --> 01:57:58,440
it will be like analyzing extracting and

2499
01:57:58,440 --> 01:57:59,940
like practice

2500
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:03,739
and and what should we care about

2501
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:06,260
um

2502
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:10,080
true that's yeah any particular process

2503
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:13,560
yeah uh I think it implies being

2504
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:16,800
politically having an approach that is

2505
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,400
politically engaged and also maybe

2506
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:23,360
building upon his answer

2507
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:26,400
listening to different actors and

2508
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,920
especially the marginalized and not the

2509
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:32,060
the what do you call them

2510
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:36,619
official sources of knowledge okay

2511
01:58:36,619 --> 01:58:40,219
interesting yeah

2512
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:47,460
it can also be accepting that there is

2513
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:49,880
no classes

2514
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:54,860
but like everything in the context and

2515
01:59:01,139 --> 01:59:03,199
okay

2516
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:06,360
yeah I have to hold myself not a good

2517
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:08,699
discussion but it's an interesting point

2518
01:59:08,699 --> 01:59:10,800
I think it's about being critical about

2519
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,860
what effect is personally I would say be

2520
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:16,380
sensitive how to how effect is produced

2521
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:20,820
to use blue laptop in the sense that if

2522
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:23,699
you put men in white jackets it would

2523
01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:25,860
give certain people them more power to

2524
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:28,199
actually produce a fact whereas other

2525
01:59:28,199 --> 01:59:30,420
voices marginal voices will not be in

2526
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:32,460
that position yeah

2527
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:33,619
um

2528
01:59:33,619 --> 01:59:36,599
like a field level it involves like

2529
01:59:36,599 --> 01:59:39,239
taking care of the implications of the

2530
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:41,340
way you're conceptualizing things are in

2531
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:44,219
terms of economic and social impacts of

2532
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:45,619
that and then

2533
01:59:45,619 --> 01:59:48,000
re-evaluating the theory sort of

2534
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,800
Frameworks that you're using based on

2535
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:51,360
what you're finding on that yeah

2536
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,520
interesting so it's again being

2537
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,619
reflexive about your own positionality

2538
01:59:55,619 --> 01:59:59,159
trying to tease out to what extents uh

2539
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:00,960
your positionality shapes the questions

2540
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,699
you ask

2541
02:00:02,699 --> 02:00:05,400
um and then try to address that one way

2542
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:09,199
or another it's not easy yeah

2543
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,840
um

2544
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:28,820
foreign

2545
02:00:33,139 --> 02:00:35,639
label process

2546
02:00:35,639 --> 02:00:39,000
where some voices sound louder than

2547
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,260
others

2548
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,900
it reproduces stuff like that it also

2549
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:46,440
has geographical uh implications because

2550
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:48,900
it's not just some people I mean it

2551
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:51,420
overlays with spatial structures I think

2552
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:54,900
about it Global diploma Global cells

2553
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:57,780
okay thanks a lot I mean uh exactly I

2554
02:00:57,780 --> 02:01:00,480
mean I have not so much to add to that

2555
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,940
you can take the definition of of Jonas

2556
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:05,040
at all and I think it captures some of

2557
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:08,280
the things that were being said uh think

2558
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:10,980
about New Concepts that reveal something

2559
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:13,080
that we didn't know yet it's kind of

2560
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:15,179
obvious but still

2561
02:01:15,179 --> 02:01:18,599
um think about being politically engaged

2562
02:01:18,599 --> 02:01:22,260
yes something that matters uh one way or

2563
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:25,020
another but be reflexive about the fact

2564
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:27,119
that some things might really matter

2565
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:29,340
being picked up but not necessarily be

2566
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:32,159
uh you could say very Progressive I mean

2567
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:35,340
in a fascist Society there's all kinds

2568
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:38,040
of knowledge on segregation to be

2569
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,960
produced that is very useful and it

2570
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,760
could be extremely politically engaged

2571
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:45,300
in that but not necessarily uh

2572
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:46,920
thinking about you could say

2573
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:49,040
marginalized forces there

2574
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:51,719
third Point indeed taking seriously the

2575
02:01:51,719 --> 02:01:53,360
experiences lies practicing words of

2576
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:56,580
ordinary Urban residents

2577
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:58,739
or marginalized social groups to think

2578
02:01:58,739 --> 02:02:01,020
about really okay we have this hegemonic

2579
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:03,179
representation

2580
02:02:03,179 --> 02:02:04,739
what would happen if we would ask

2581
02:02:04,739 --> 02:02:06,300
different people if we start in a

2582
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:08,179
different positionality etc etc

2583
02:02:08,179 --> 02:02:11,760
obviously you have your positionality as

2584
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:14,159
a researcher on yourself

2585
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,139
and it may be sometimes very hard for

2586
02:02:16,139 --> 02:02:19,199
instance as a man to study feminist

2587
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:22,699
perspectives it may also be not

2588
02:02:22,699 --> 02:02:26,520
recognized as being a rightful person to

2589
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:29,460
studying these kind of aspects so I

2590
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:31,800
think it's a it's it's a kind of a a

2591
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:34,139
negotiation process there and then again

2592
02:02:34,139 --> 02:02:36,480
or think about

2593
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:39,960
um women that that focus on

2594
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:43,619
the eliteness of investment banking in

2595
02:02:43,619 --> 02:02:45,540
the city think about work of Linda

2596
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:49,619
McDowell for instance and how how it's a

2597
02:02:49,619 --> 02:02:51,239
difficult process for women to actually

2598
02:02:51,239 --> 02:02:54,480
enter these spaces have access but once

2599
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,099
they get access they ask very different

2600
02:02:56,099 --> 02:02:58,320
questions and they'll actually lead to

2601
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:02,280
quite uh revolutionary insights

2602
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:04,320
an alternative formulation and that's

2603
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,659
why I was a little bit hesitant with uh

2604
02:03:06,659 --> 02:03:09,719
there are no facts I don't agree I think

2605
02:03:09,719 --> 02:03:11,340
there are

2606
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:14,219
um effects facts in a sense that there

2607
02:03:14,219 --> 02:03:18,060
are factual realities and a new series

2608
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:21,300
kind of um kind of Middle Ground between

2609
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:22,920
you could say

2610
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:24,960
um truth as being something that's being

2611
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,159
constructed

2612
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:28,500
but you always have to construct it on

2613
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:30,900
the basis of some kind of empirical

2614
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:35,219
factual reality uh so not a radical

2615
02:03:35,219 --> 02:03:37,679
deconstruction or post-structuralist

2616
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:40,619
thinking uh there's always a way of

2617
02:03:40,619 --> 02:03:42,840
saying this is I don't know the entire

2618
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:45,239
truth but this is probably a little bit

2619
02:03:45,239 --> 02:03:47,520
more true than something else

2620
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,699
and yeah you can write the citation uh

2621
02:03:50,699 --> 02:03:52,400
read the citation sorry

2622
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:55,020
what he says is that the ultimate goal

2623
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:57,420
is to reduce uh

2624
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:01,080
illusion in society in and of itself so

2625
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:03,440
if you have shark

2626
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:06,659
periodical analytical categories and

2627
02:04:06,659 --> 02:04:08,940
Concepts you can work with that and you

2628
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,320
will see things perhaps in a different

2629
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:14,219
light and take away as

2630
02:04:14,219 --> 02:04:16,980
false beliefs and Illusions in society

2631
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:20,360
and it also means that it's a kind of a

2632
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:22,860
placeless and Timeless definition in the

2633
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:24,719
sense that this could be the mission for

2634
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:26,820
instance of critical Urban studies or

2635
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:28,800
critical urban geography and what is

2636
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:31,199
critical and what is a false belief and

2637
02:04:31,199 --> 02:04:33,119
what is an illusion may change over time

2638
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:35,699
so it's kind of it keeps holding the

2639
02:04:35,699 --> 02:04:38,699
definition but it may have to be updated

2640
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:42,000
in terms of how it works and exactly so

2641
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,920
some rules of thumb

2642
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:44,639
um

2643
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:47,159
there's no universal theory of any

2644
02:04:47,159 --> 02:04:50,460
anything and I think we'll uh we'll show

2645
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:54,000
that uh we have to be sensitive to the

2646
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,219
fact that every theory has its

2647
02:04:56,219 --> 02:04:57,960
birthmarks

2648
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:00,780
what were the questions uh that really

2649
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:03,659
gave rise to formulating a research

2650
02:05:03,659 --> 02:05:05,639
question to a theory in a particular way

2651
02:05:05,639 --> 02:05:08,400
well we'll have to take a look at the

2652
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,619
context about historically and spatially

2653
02:05:10,619 --> 02:05:14,159
uh to understand uh what that was so

2654
02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:16,860
think about The Chicago School that

2655
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:19,340
you'll be talking about with Nick

2656
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:22,500
it's it was assumed to be Universal

2657
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:24,719
model there's actually a model of a city

2658
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:28,920
that captures rapid urbanization in the

2659
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:31,139
early 20th century in Northern America

2660
02:05:31,139 --> 02:05:33,060
and then the question to an extent that

2661
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:34,440
actually explains something in different

2662
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:36,239
locations in different times

2663
02:05:36,239 --> 02:05:38,400
we're not going to reject that but we

2664
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,139
have to mobilize that concept and see

2665
02:05:40,139 --> 02:05:41,460
how far we get

2666
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:43,800
so we have to be reflexive about these

2667
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:46,440
bird marks so yeah even the concept of

2668
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:49,020
class is something that is a western

2669
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:50,820
Inception if you will

2670
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:52,739
to what extent does it allow to actually

2671
02:05:52,739 --> 02:05:55,739
capture for instance Indian Society

2672
02:05:55,739 --> 02:05:58,440
so we need to kind of provincialize

2673
02:05:58,440 --> 02:06:00,900
theory and say okay it originated at

2674
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:03,599
some point and now we can meaningfully

2675
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:05,520
think about how we can speak across

2676
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:07,980
context so think about

2677
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:08,880
um

2678
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:11,520
a global city has a concept that emerged

2679
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,560
say mostly in in Northern America

2680
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:15,659
Western Europe what extent does it allow

2681
02:06:15,659 --> 02:06:17,400
to capture what is going on in Singapore

2682
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:20,760
for instance so to play uh while being

2683
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:23,699
reflexive about these Concepts uh with

2684
02:06:23,699 --> 02:06:25,679
the application across

2685
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:28,320
and engages pluralism that's kind of I

2686
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,239
mean might be for engaged pluralism it

2687
02:06:30,239 --> 02:06:31,440
means that there are different kind of

2688
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:33,300
theoretical stances different kind of

2689
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:35,340
questions being asked entering from

2690
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:37,920
different kind of teams and I think it's

2691
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,580
not just about

2692
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:42,540
acknowledging that but it's actually

2693
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:44,699
engaging with this kind of descent

2694
02:06:44,699 --> 02:06:47,340
opinions and try to look for a

2695
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:49,020
conversation and

2696
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:50,699
maybe we can talk a little bit more

2697
02:06:50,699 --> 02:06:52,260
about that next week or in the next

2698
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:53,400
sessions

2699
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:56,400
as Urban Studies have grown and kind of

2700
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,860
become ever more Global as the

2701
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:01,320
urbanization has also globalized there's

2702
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:04,020
always a risk that has some

2703
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:06,960
um work that we become lost in in

2704
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:09,300
comparison to use the words of Jamie

2705
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:11,280
pack that we lose our points of

2706
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,380
reference they actually be able to to

2707
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:15,960
have some kind of coherent Urban studies

2708
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:18,540
project or at least speak to one another

2709
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:21,060
so I think there's a danger with a

2710
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:23,040
Global Research agenda with so many

2711
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,320
contextual differences how do we still

2712
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:27,719
make sense of urban processes in

2713
02:07:27,719 --> 02:07:31,320
Singapore versus uh versus Brussels how

2714
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:33,119
do you prepare

2715
02:07:33,119 --> 02:07:35,280
now I won't bore you now to death with

2716
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,320
the next few slides too much but I just

2717
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:39,000
want to say

2718
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,820
um that what geography was and what kind

2719
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:44,340
of critical questions were asked has

2720
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:47,760
changed tremendously uh throughout time

2721
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:50,820
much of geography originally was

2722
02:07:50,820 --> 02:07:53,580
really about human interaction with the

2723
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:55,500
environment

2724
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:56,580
um

2725
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:59,460
say environmental determinism where it

2726
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:01,320
was really believed yes it's really the

2727
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,060
physical environment that will shape

2728
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:05,099
human activities

2729
02:08:05,099 --> 02:08:07,440
Regional geography was also a very big

2730
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,599
tradition especially before the second

2731
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:11,639
world war where it was really about this

2732
02:08:11,639 --> 02:08:14,639
description of human activities in their

2733
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:16,560
physical media there's still some

2734
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,179
tradition there but what really happened

2735
02:08:18,179 --> 02:08:20,699
after the second world war boasts were

2736
02:08:20,699 --> 02:08:22,860
area especially since the 70s it was a

2737
02:08:22,860 --> 02:08:25,080
period of let's say great social and

2738
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:28,260
political and economic upheaval is a

2739
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:31,199
huge branching out of

2740
02:08:31,199 --> 02:08:33,900
um of geography so that's quite a

2741
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:37,320
plurality of traditions there and they

2742
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:39,599
take us quite far from the the origins

2743
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:42,080
of geography was was really about

2744
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:45,619
settlements if you will and then in the

2745
02:08:45,619 --> 02:08:49,320
pre-World War era was about okay show

2746
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,119
East Anglia and where are the

2747
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:54,119
settlements or describe me the structure

2748
02:08:54,119 --> 02:08:57,119
of a city after the second world war

2749
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:59,880
especially in the 80s it was a kind of a

2750
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:01,860
nomothetic move and the kind of we have

2751
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:03,960
to formalize this and you have for

2752
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:07,560
instance Boulder Crystal who came with a

2753
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:10,440
quite a neat model to explain why at

2754
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:12,119
certain locations you had certain

2755
02:09:12,119 --> 02:09:15,540
settlements of a certain size or for

2756
02:09:15,540 --> 02:09:18,360
instance he owns a much more such

2757
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:21,300
formalizing the idea okay if there's

2758
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:23,219
certain activities within a city at a

2759
02:09:23,219 --> 02:09:25,139
certain space it must have something to

2760
02:09:25,139 --> 02:09:27,000
do with the kind of value that is being

2761
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,420
generated by those activities and the

2762
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:32,880
fact that some activities outfit others

2763
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,920
on a certain location so these are kind

2764
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:37,139
of foundational approaches and I'm going

2765
02:09:37,139 --> 02:09:40,320
very fast here I know but it's just to

2766
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:43,860
take note of that this led to a much

2767
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:48,000
more plural uh discussion as of the 70s

2768
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,940
and I I can't really do justice to all

2769
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:53,760
these different Traditions here but what

2770
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,440
you could say more radical and critical

2771
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:58,380
voices uh share in one tradition you

2772
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:00,239
could say yes questions of social

2773
02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:04,739
justice uh distribution they work in a

2774
02:10:04,739 --> 02:10:07,619
materialist setting so what people have

2775
02:10:07,619 --> 02:10:10,500
and how does class for instance income

2776
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:13,340
Etc plus how does that explain divisions

2777
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:16,080
in the city

2778
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:19,320
nice names such as David Harvey uh Neil

2779
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:20,119
Smith

2780
02:10:20,119 --> 02:10:23,340
those were kind of a period with a lot

2781
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:25,739
of change we have social mobility of the

2782
02:10:25,739 --> 02:10:28,199
working class in 1970s

2783
02:10:28,199 --> 02:10:31,260
um feminist geographies uh that also

2784
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:33,599
emerged at this point

2785
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:36,599
um questioning male-dominated views

2786
02:10:36,599 --> 02:10:38,820
um on society

2787
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:41,880
Etc so thinking about placing geography

2788
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:45,060
relating it to process of of

2789
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:47,760
um of capitalism

2790
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:51,119
the other big strands you could say

2791
02:10:51,119 --> 02:10:51,659
um

2792
02:10:51,659 --> 02:10:53,960
there's more you could say a humanist

2793
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:56,820
humanistic geography that thinks about

2794
02:10:56,820 --> 02:11:00,360
urban lifestyles Urban behaviors Urban

2795
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:04,260
cultures which less kind of relates

2796
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:08,060
itself to uh to capitalism uh in a sense

2797
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:10,980
but really starts with okay what kind of

2798
02:11:10,980 --> 02:11:14,099
forces haven't we heard in the city how

2799
02:11:14,099 --> 02:11:16,619
are cities being experienced can we

2800
02:11:16,619 --> 02:11:18,719
think about the power of representation

2801
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:20,400
how different spaces are being

2802
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,560
represented what the power of discourses

2803
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,780
is it's not just about material

2804
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:26,460
circumstances also how we think about

2805
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:28,920
certain places that will explain what

2806
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:30,119
takes place

2807
02:11:30,119 --> 02:11:32,340
and also a shift towards more insane

2808
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:34,320
qualitative methods

2809
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,360
um that kind of simplifies the cultural

2810
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:39,420
turn uh more widely okay

2811
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:41,099
and this is not at the end of a

2812
02:11:41,099 --> 02:11:42,840
conversation I would say and that's kind

2813
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:45,420
of the abundance of further studies

2814
02:11:45,420 --> 02:11:48,719
uh more widely and Robin particular that

2815
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:50,400
all these different approaches exist

2816
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,619
next to one another but you have to kind

2817
02:11:52,619 --> 02:11:55,260
of be aware that they work in different

2818
02:11:55,260 --> 02:11:57,119
kind of traditions and then we'll

2819
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,639
formulate questions in a particular way

2820
02:11:59,639 --> 02:12:02,699
and I think you will see returning here

2821
02:12:02,699 --> 02:12:04,560
and there throughout the course somebody

2822
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:06,420
who works perhaps a little bit more in

2823
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:08,159
that framework or starts to refer to

2824
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:10,139
that tradition and it's something to be

2825
02:12:10,139 --> 02:12:11,940
aware of I can't do justice to the

2826
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:14,060
history of geography in three slides

2827
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:17,880
that would be over the top but it's

2828
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:19,619
something to think about

2829
02:12:19,619 --> 02:12:21,900
okay I'll end there sorry for taking a

2830
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:24,840
little bit longer by next week please

2831
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:27,540
try to get over these two texts

2832
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:30,239
um or share it with your colleagues and

2833
02:12:30,239 --> 02:12:32,760
the world city hypothesis by John

2834
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:36,239
Friedman and ALDI and uh somewhat less

2835
02:12:36,239 --> 02:12:39,719
old but still already investigated uh

2836
02:12:39,719 --> 02:12:42,920
text by saskia

2837
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:49,460
mixed with muscles

2838
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:51,179
all right

2839
02:12:51,179 --> 02:12:54,480
thank you very much

2840
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:57,860
um and see you next week

2841
02:12:59,690 --> 02:13:02,740
