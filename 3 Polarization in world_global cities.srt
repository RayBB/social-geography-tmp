[Music]

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,639
um

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,319
[Music]

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,820
okay welcome everybody to the third

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,740
session Urban social geography

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,620
this week's topic is polarization growth

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,380
in global cities uh now at just a few

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,660
housekeeping announcements I think in

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,219
the meantime everybody has seen

10
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,500
schedules regarding discussion seminars

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,960
I think there's still some minor issues

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,539
here and there trying to get that sorted

13
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,300
as soon as possible but make sure next

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,520
week there will be a discussion similar

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,039
for each and every one of you so please

16
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,440
attend and if you're there to present

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,899
um stick to the guidelines which just

18
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,640
try to stick in 10 minutes of

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,519
presentation because it will be a tight

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,020
exercise in any case

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,900
try to practice a little bit at home so

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,720
that you stay within those 10 minutes as

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,820
much as possible

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,920
um and then we'll have a nice discussion

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,020
also be advised that we start with

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,840
excursions this Friday and we start in

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,020
Brussels for those uh Urban and urban

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,000

and we meet at plus Simon Bolivar which

33
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,340
is the main square at the site of the

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,159
World Trade Center looking towards the

35
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,759
canal so Simon Bolivar and you'll see if

36
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,460
you're early either me wearing a very

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,119
special hat uh perhaps and some roses

38
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,340
and then if you're later you'll see a

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,560
whole bunch of people so you can't

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,960
really miss us in any case we'll be down

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,000
the stairs and somewhere on the Square

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,880
there's a few benches there we will

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,720
probably end around five at latest in

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,239
European quarter

45
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,540
uh and yeah uh you can bring lunch uh

46
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,220
but you can also buy lunch somewhere

47
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,220
there will be time over uh at lunch time

48
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,099
to actually uh buy things wherever you

49
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,620
want okay so that's not necessary I have

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,840
no idea what whether it will be this the

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,599
police check the weather forecast and

52
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,420
just accordingly and as I've learned a

53
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,720
pencil works better than a pen it's kind

54
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,120
of weatherproof although I hope it's not

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,980
a tornado that it's going to hit

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,160
Brussels okay

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,860
um right

58
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,739
so last week we've been talking about

59
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,019
you could say uh how to understand the

60
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,660
role of cities in the global economy the

61
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,819
whole discussion about command and

62
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,640
control functions to what extent uh

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,220
Power in This Global Urban system

64
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,459
relates to either headquarters and the

65
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,800
more classic world cities definition or

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,019
rather it refers to you could say this

67
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,720
amalgamation or complex of advanced

68
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,540
producer Services

69
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,739
um who collectively produce control

70
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,120
capabilities over global production

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,220
networks Global Financial markets we

72
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,800
also discussed plenty of uh critiques

73
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,280
different forms of critique on those

74
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,540
paradigms

75
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,239
what we'll try to do today is turn The

76
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
Coin around and

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,860
kind of in the spirit of uh John

78
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,500
Friedman's work back to the 80s if you

79
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,220
will

80
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,799
is also try to reflect on what extent

81
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,420
the insertion in these Global Urban

82
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,780
systems these powerful roles in the

83
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,019
global economy also affects the internal

84
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,299
structure of City so it's kind of this

85
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,819
macro micro link

86
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,459
last week we went from oh my gosh the

87
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,400
economy is globalizing uh what does this

88
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,340
tell us about uh the changing role of

89
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,280
cities in that global economy now having

90
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,920
established that centrality in the

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,019
global economy now we wonder to an

92
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,139
extent there are effects or implications

93
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,238
of that insertion on the social

94
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,360
structure of cities okay so it's kind of

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,520
the the flip side of last week's talk

96
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,919
so just to get started a little bit some

97
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,940
maps

98
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,080
uh was there a question

99
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
yes

100
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,880
I understand yes it was a bit packed so

101
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,979
let's try to have a break somewhere at

102
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,840
the um yeah at six something or five

103
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,440
past six yeah sure no problem

104
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,580
um yeah so Maps uh I I will yes

105
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,940
Apartments

106
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,800
the live stream isn't working

107
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,180
okay

108
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,040
or rather not okay

109
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,199
it is recording

110
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,069
[Music]

111
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,400
yeah

112
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,660
as you can see there's a red button

113
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,419
there and I think

114
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:34,400
the audio is supposed to work

115
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,080
zero viewers okay that gives us a hint

116
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,560
um let's see

117
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,479
the wrong link okay let's see

118
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,600
um

119
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,300
yeah

120
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,280
all right let me just put this online

121
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,240
ah

122
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,040
um

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,379
[Music]

124
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,260
um

125
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,880
[Music]

126
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,080
it looks awfully the same

127
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,220
doesn't it

128
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,490
[Music]

129
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:18,259
thank you

130
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,039
there's already one viewer

131
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,979
so that means it works three yeah I

132
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,460
think we're there

133
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,460
is it okay

134
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,660
yeah

135
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,800
all right then

136
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,520
okay let me just try to start again I

137
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,860
start with some Maps always nice as

138
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,759
Urban geographers here's a maps from

139
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,020
Australia that I will talk a little bit

140
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,180
more about in a second from the

141
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,720
opportunity Atlas in the US basically

142
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,400
shows you

143
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,800
um the median household income of

144
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,319
residents over a certain period so this

145
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,080
is Chicago the darker I mean the the

146
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,900
Bluer the Richer if you will the higher

147
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,380
the income and the more the US is read

148
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,220
it's it's lowering so kind of see is

149
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,340
very much kind of concentrated wealth in

150
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,879
the city center apparently of Chicago

151
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,919
and then you can say the peripheries and

152
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,740
this kind of other Rings uh of Chicago

153
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,319
with lower incomes and then going back

154
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,039
further from the from the center

155
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,958
Richter neighborhoods

156
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,839
um kind of the opposite picture here in

157
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,179
uh Detroit I'll show some examples from

158
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,919
the US because there's this great

159
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,140
material on that

160
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,580
um here we see a very large

161
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,980
concentration of say poverty or low

162
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,640
lower incomes in the city center or if

163
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,399
it's actually the city of Detroit which

164
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,120
interestingly ends at this kind of Road

165
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,560
here which is 80 mile roads which you

166
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,500
may know if you still know who Eminem is

167
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,800
he's been talking about this

168
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,399
um

169
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,380
I think he was born and raised somewhere

170
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,360
over there it acts as a kind of a city

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,940
limit uh you could say the inner city

172
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,700
neighborhood and also uh it's also kind

173
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,380
of a fiscal limit

174
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,980
um

175
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,279
uh at this at this point and we see that

176
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,080
actually it's it's a quite strong social

177
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,300
spatial divide between poorer

178
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,860
neighborhoods in the city center and

179
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,459
then richer suburbs you may know that

180
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,640
Detroit has gone into default a few

181
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,300
years ago so it's kind of uh a weird

182
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,820
situation because it it is a rich

183
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,600
agglomeration if you will but uh the

184
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,640
city itself which kind of ends at the

185
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,399
Eight Mile Road uh is quite poor so

186
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,959
there's a lot of people commuting into

187
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,180
the city that are quite rich but the

188
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,820
fiscal base of the city itself is kind

189
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,060
of it's kind of limited okay so quite a

190
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,600
a large rupture there in space

191
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,240
other examples are

192
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,560
Los Angeles a lot of inner city uh

193
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,000
poverty and very rich uh suburbs if you

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,480
will we all know Beverly Hills uh and

195
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,040
and those kind of

196
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,740
um areas

197
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,920
um this is Miami just another example

198
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,200
where we start contrasts at the

199
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,980
neighborhood level uh between say north

200
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,220
um Miami and South Miami and also quite

201
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,860
a start difference between

202
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,399
um let's say Miami Beach and the kind of

203
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,820
where the tourist areas are

204
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,760
and the continent if you will or what is

205
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,700
kind of interesting in the case of Miami

206
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,980
is that actually uh from a

207
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,140
climatological environmental perspective

208
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,860
it's actually quite safe to live onshore

209
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,019
and these are kind of the poorer

210
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,800
neighborhoods with kind of uh increased

211
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,540
strength of floods and those kind of

212
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,760
things we see some kind of a movement

213
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,180
back onshore also by richer people some

214
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,060
people call this climate related

215
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,620
gentrification we start seeing an

216
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,200
appreciation of real estate values on

217
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,620
Shore so it kind of shows that that

218
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,180
environmental impacts all so

219
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,519
kind of start impacting social spatial

220
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,640
divisions another example

221
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,140
um

222
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,160
of New Orleans as you may know

223
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,579
from more than a decade ago it was hit

224
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:46,380
by a a large hurricane and also had a

225
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,560
very differentiated effect in racialized

226
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,019
and ethnic terms a lot of people were

227
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,959
were hit were left without help a lot of

228
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,640
people residing in these poor

229
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,860
neighborhoods often also had a different

230
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,940
kind of ethnic background

231
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,600
um

232
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,200
so again quite a bit of Divisions there

233
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,660
um San Francisco

234
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,320
um

235
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,100
looks pretty well gentrified uh also

236
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,500
kind of very common sensical I mean you

237
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,720
look at at real estate prices in The

238
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,600
Wider San Francisco Bay area and it's

239
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,019
obviously also related to this kind of

240
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,620
happiness or Global city regeness

241
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,800
regionalism that is that is uh going on

242
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,800
there but just still a few pockets of of

243
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,860
urban property for instance uh Chinatown

244
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,500
there to the north perhaps also the

245
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,300
mission which is a kind of a another

246
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,920
neighborhood yes

247
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,740
always the classification numbers

248
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,180
because it seems to know that the

249
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,040
distribution like that we had income

250
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,800
levels isn't kind of doesn't typically

251
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,980
normalized for the specific uh if you

252
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,660
know anything about that uh no I think

253
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,880
it's uh if you look at the scale it's

254
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,220
the same everywhere right so uh so you

255
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,000
can compare across cities as well and

256
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,040
it's a good point it could mean that we

257
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,620
kind of lose some of the Nuance in

258
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,000
certain places

259
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,180
but what you gain is comparability

260
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,279
across across cities but I can say a bit

261
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,779
more about that in a second

262
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,779
New York uh a city that will be talking

263
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,680
more about uh very kind of Rich Lower

264
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,500
Manhattan if you go to the north I feel

265
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,660
a bit like a weatherman here I'm going

266
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,880
to the north it's uh

267
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,160
it's as we know

268
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,220
um a bit more cloudy no I mean it's a

269
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,579
it's a an area with with lower incomes

270
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,000
uh the Bronx an interesting areas also

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,899
here

272
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,420
um Brooklyn

273
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,980
which we'll be talking about a bit later

274
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,839
uh which kind of follows the income uh

275
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,120
characteristics of of Manhattan there's

276
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,120
kind of still Lower East and we have

277
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,680
like a Little Italy and those kind of

278
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,420
places who are still you could say uh

279
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,860
giving some shelter to people that are

280
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,779
not crazy Rich

281
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,120
um but you could say a lot of

282
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,000
concentrated 12 in the center then or

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,160
what kind of area with with the poorer

284
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,380
population and then you could say uh the

285
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,440
rich kind of suburbs Begin Again

286
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,899
now the point is not necessarily today

287
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,320
to talk about spatial structures uh

288
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,220
you'll talk way more uh about that with

289
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,959
uh with Nick

290
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,660
and she'll discuss segregation patterns

291
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,639
and those kind of things what I want to

292
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,279
focus on is mostly you could say the

293
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,880
reality of it's a division uh income

294
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,120
divisions class divisions in cities so

295
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,699
where do you do these uh examples come

296
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,920
from this is a I think you'll find at

297
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,139
the great website uh it's it's called

298
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,480
the opportunity Atlas

299
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,540
and what I've actually it intends to do

300
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,240
and it also connects to the work uh that

301
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,160
of Nick or that the things that Nick

302
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,220
will talk about it tries to trace you

303
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,079
could say neighborhood effects and the

304
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,880
idea is that the neighborhood that you

305
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,079
raise them

306
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,320
we'll have a substantial role in your

307
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,120
future life chances

308
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,060
and they're they basically uh but you

309
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,639
can read more about about it on this

310
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,459
webpage they basically tracked uh the

311
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,399
evolution of people with a kind of Life

312
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,160
development or careers of people uh

313
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,660
linking it back to their original

314
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,459
neighborhood so to the places they were

315
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,260
born in so they could say okay people

316
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,420
that were born in the Bronx

317
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,699
16 years later

318
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,220
what is the kind of chance they become

319
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,660
incarcerated

320
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,880
what is their income level

321
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,000
etc etc so it's kind of in a way

322
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,279
uh trying to measure some form of

323
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,079
spatial privilege

324
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,440
by having a result or being born in

325
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,600
certain neighborhoods that will have

326
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,480
actually an effect uh which is in some

327
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,360
way you could say reducible to the uh to

328
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,800
the amenities that you have to the

329
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,660
social context that you have but perhaps

330
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,100
there's also even more than that maybe

331
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,139
it's some kind of an isolated spatial

332
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,120
effect beyond that so that's kind of The

333
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Wider context of uh this Atlas And I

334
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,540
think yeah it's I would have hoped that

335
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,820
we had this for Europe it's a great

336
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,160
resource and you can you can browse a

337
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,019
bit do that but what I just want to

338
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,360
focus on today is the fact or use as

339
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,880
exhibits are these

340
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,639
um uh these income maps to illustrate

341
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,920
that

342
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,899
polarization in terms of income is a

343
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,779
day-to-day reality in a lot of U.S

344
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,720
metropolises had we had the data and

345
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,360
Europe we would also find uh quite star

346
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,820
contracts perhaps a little bit less but

347
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,880
still uh it would also be there so what

348
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,519
we can discuss then today I think is to

349
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,220
what extent class divisions

350
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,000
are reproduced in and through space and

351
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,660
actually try to understand why such

352
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,880
divisions occur in cities in the first

353
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,619
place now that's a very big debate

354
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,199
obviously what we'll try to do is try to

355
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,520
link that

356
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,459
to the debate we had last week and try

357
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,919
to link to what extents Global and world

358
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,740
city functions add to

359
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,439
existing polarization because

360
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,679
we cannot reduce it to an effect of

361
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,780
having headquarters or something

362
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,740
but perhaps entering uh the discussion

363
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,380
through globalized urbanization we could

364
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,059
actually start unpacking some of these

365
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,760
things so class divisions are about

366
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,919
the fact that we see social spatial

367
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,200
structures on the basis of social

368
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,880
groupings of

369
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,480
uh income profession occupational

370
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,419
structure and those facts so looking

371
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,660
through income levels and occupation we

372
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,960
find a social especially diverse

373
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
structure

374
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,299
now I use class here in a very let's say

375
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,900
uh analytical naive way because if you

376
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,160
use class

377
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,440
in many cases authors would also refer

378
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,660
to some form of identity formation

379
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,340
linked to that

380
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,280
that's not what I do here

381
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,740
it's more of uh much more mundane

382
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,340
looking at income levels

383
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,960
to look at the changing structure of the

384
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,660
city there's big debates to what extent

385
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,000
there is still such thing as class

386
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,580
identity

387
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,559
has something to do with existence of

388
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,440
subcultures depolitization etc etc

389
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,720
that's not really the point here it

390
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
would be an interesting debate it's more

391
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,340
about can we see objective objectifiable

392
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,340
divisions there in in society based upon

393
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,520
income and occupation okay just to clear

394
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,100
that a little bit

395
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,059
all right

396
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:57,900
um

397
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,120
so polarization

398
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,160
um it has been on the agenda has been

399
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,000
one of the main uh source of impetus or

400
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,799
or starting point for the world and

401
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,020
Global cities debate and again going

402
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,840
back to John Friedman and sort of wolf

403
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,000
in 1982

404
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,940
it's it's what kind of initiated their

405
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,179
interests there so just allow me to

406
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,980
recite with its towers of Steel and

407
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,620
glass with sensible shopping malls The

408
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,980
Citadel is the city's most vulnerable

409
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,260
symbol it's smooth surfaces suggest a

410
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,780
sleek and personality of money power

411
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,299
its interior spaces are ample elegant

412
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,559
and plush

413
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,900
and a properly secluded space is the

414
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,520
transnational Elites have built their

415
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,679
residences and playgrounds

416
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,200
country clubs and Bridal paths and

417
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,840
private beaches the overcrowded ghettos

418
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,179
exist in the far Shadows of the Citadel

419
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,400
where it is further divided into racial

420
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,100
and ethnic enclaves

421
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,500
some areas are Shanty towns none are

422
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,840
well provided with public services

423
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,400
garbages that does not get collected

424
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,559
only the police in the squad cars are

425
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,200
visible in evidence in many places

426
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,660
ghetto residents are allowed outside

427
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,520
their zones only during working hours

428
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,740
their appearance in the Citadel after

429
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,000
dark creates a small panic so it's kind

430
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,940
of a very dystopian image

431
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,120
you could say it's exaggerated it's kind

432
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,260
of

433
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,380
um not exactly empowering it's also very

434
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,660
black white but it's there's something

435
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,000
with this opposition that they that they

436
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,299
try to work with there's some kind of uh

437
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:39,299
growing divide in cities that is going

438
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,419
to become a social problem and that's

439
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,039
also what you also read in the world

440
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,860
city hypothesis of John Friedman

441
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,820
um

442
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,700
it's at some point it will become

443
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,020
everybody's problem and probably

444
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,240
probably also the problem of the elite

445
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,500
now again this kind of description tries

446
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,780
to capture a particular reality last

447
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,940
week I think I mentioned uh Robert De

448
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,760
Niro and Taxi Driver

449
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,900
uh perhaps

450
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,880
um uh John Friedman thought more talking

451
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,720
about contemporary La uh which is kind

452
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,140
of marked by The Citadel form uh to your

453
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,840
left uh if you've ever been to La I mean

454
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,120
a lot of Elites or people that are

455
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,419
walking around here never touch ground

456
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:26,340
they hover around they never go on

457
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,159
ground floor but it's kind of probably

458
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,380
dropped by a taxi in one of the hotels

459
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,900
and then they go at the first floor

460
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,559
level uh or second floor level in the US

461
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,539
from one building to another so it's not

462
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,940
only kind of uh horizontally segregated

463
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,380
there's also some kind of vertical

464
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,480
segregation there so that's kind of this

465
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,720
flow of people is not mixed with

466
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,299
um with bosses by

467
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,539
um then a bit further just kind of two

468
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,880
three four hundred meters is Bull Street

469
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,940
La uh not to be confused with Wall

470
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,340
Street in New York and this is kind of

471
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,020
where a completely different kind of

472
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,820
neighborhoods start so as you remember

473
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,400
this map from La

474
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,520
um in general you could say a very poor

475
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,900
uh in the city uh neighborhood

476
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,960
but kind of imprinted but by a number of

477
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,059
hotels

478
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,900
uh which kind of breathe post-modern uh

479
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,020
feelings and sentiments uh but then very

480
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,820
close to that immediately you're kind of

481
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,600
struck with with rapid kind of decline

482
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,640
um some people would call this a zone of

483
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,320
transition and we'll be talking with

484
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,740
Nick about the burgers uh model of of

485
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,080
cities there's a kind of a place that is

486
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,760
in change it's kind of changing

487
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,400
functions uh it's also a place where a

488
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,240
lot of uh migrants arrive

489
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,159
there's a lot of informal economy etc

490
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,080
etc and there's also kind of an idea

491
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,620
even in contemporary La that these

492
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,080
places The Citadel if you will these

493
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,179
hotels are also places that should not

494
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,980
be frequented by people that have

495
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,260
nothing to do there and just yeah as I

496
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,039
walk by I I think it was at the doorstep

497
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,580
of some of a plaza of Bank of America

498
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,000
something that I that I I took it um

499
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,960
yeah Bank Tower at Fifth Street

500
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,120
and it's kind of regulating social space

501
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,700
there and yeah you can't really read it

502
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,620
now but maybe you should read it at home

503
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,200
there's kind of very ambiguous language

504
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,220
being used so any activities that are uh

505
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,280
how's it phrase again that makes

506
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,059
annoyance or Muses that are

507
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:43,919
already annoying people or could annoy

508
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,559
people are actually not allowed there so

509
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,760
it's a very you could say uh ambiguous

510
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,880
fake description which gives for

511
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,100
instance social security guards the

512
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,559
Liberty to actually yeah remove people

513
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,840
from public space people that are

514
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,720
homeless and there's a there's a huge

515
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,640
homelessness

516
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,740
issue in L.A people are being displaced

517
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,799
even if they put offense in in downtown

518
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:12,480
uh there's a lot of panhandling selling

519
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,340
stuff and those kind of things and that

520
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,100
is kind of policed away so it's not it's

521
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,340
to be removed from from that public

522
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,980
space is because it doesn't fit the kind

523
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,140
of perhaps expectations of people that

524
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,480
that frequent these um

525
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,780
more like Citadel structures okay so we

526
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,059
could say it's still uh it could be an

527
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,919
extreme example but still very much

528
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,880
relevant today 30 or 40 years after uh

529
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,679
John Friedman was I was talking about

530
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,200
and this this is let's say one of the

531
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,299
the leading metropolis and economic

532
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,419
terms uh of the world

533
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,320
um so if it's happening here we could

534
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,299
imagine it's also happening elsewhere

535
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,320
okay

536
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,380
now what I would try to do now is look a

537
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,760
little bit into

538
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,940
exhibits about this archetypical case if

539
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,580
you will New York City

540
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,299
um

541
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,840
to show you a bit more how polarization

542
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,799
patterns have evolved over uh the past

543
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,960
decades

544
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,880
and I mean it's a Greek drama you know

545
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,679
already what is happening and the the

546
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,940
answer is polarization has increased so

547
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,880
income this disparities between

548
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,159
different kind of income groups in

549
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,460
society has increased and why New York

550
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,820
well I mean it's wonderful to say it's

551
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,860
has been one of the of the city's world

552
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,080
cities that have has received a lot of

553
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
attention uh it's still one of the main

554
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,360
uh Financial Centers of the world uh

555
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
it's kind of an extreme case if you will

556
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,059
if you try to research the impact of of

557
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,460
uh these kind of activities on the urban

558
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,799
fabric so

559
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:59,279
um I'm referring here to a very nice uh

560
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,799
study by the fiscal policy Institute

561
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,900
it's a bit dated

562
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,940
um but I still love it

563
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,039
um I'm actually hoping that it will do

564
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,900
the exercise again quite soon the

565
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,900
previous one uh report was just before

566
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,080
the crisis this one is kind of

567
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,299
diagnosing what went on just after the

568
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,580
crisis and I hope they have some kind of

569
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,400
I don't know uh mid-covets kind of

570
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,400
reports sometime soon but I mostly look

571
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,360
in these studies at the evolution of

572
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,340
income distribution and they use all

573
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,580
kind of weird terms such as desiles

574
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,260
quintiles quartiles which refers to the

575
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,020
place of an income group in the entire

576
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,500
population so a quintile is actually a

577
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,320
fifth of the entire distribution so top

578
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,100
quintile would be the top uh 20 of

579
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,860
earners and their average income the

580
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,200
bottom quintile would be

581
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,380
um the average of of the lowest 20 of

582
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,679
incomes right so these are relative

583
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,779
terms that show the position

584
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,880
with a certain income

585
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,740
what you would they position you would

586
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,779
take in this distribution okay and it's

587
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:16,380
usually focusing on income uh which is

588
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,500
income out of Labor

589
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,279
um in one way or another okay so this is

590
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,659
just one

591
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,100
um comparison and what they also do is

592
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,460
and they try to compare New York City

593
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,679
quite often uh sometimes they don't have

594
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,380
data on on New York City itself and then

595
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,080
they use New York state but try to be as

596
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,419
specific as possible

597
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,340
um and then they also try to compare to

598
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,779
the United States that's a question

599
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,200
yeah

600
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,419
uh I think I mean large really

601
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,520
polarization but the point is indeed and

602
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,840
that's kind of something that we get to

603
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,860
later

604
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,919
is that uh the question is if you

605
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,500
obviously more most easily start looking

606
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,159
at income because this kind of data are

607
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,779
easiest to find the next question is

608
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,400
what's the underlying occupational

609
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,340
structure so what produces that reality

610
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,260
uh and that's something that will pick

611
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,240
up uh on later and it's obviously

612
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,240
connected uh quite often kind of if you

613
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,340
think about the shift towards high-end

614
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,200
service jobs

615
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,860
would generate higher incomes

616
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,880
um

617
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,220
but the connection is not always there

618
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,320
is always highly contextual the same

619
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,760
kind of

620
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,600
um

621
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,059
occupations in different contexts may

622
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,480
give a very different income level and

623
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,559
that can be for a lot of reasons

624
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,580
so yeah but here we're talking about

625
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,980
income polarization uh to be sure

626
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,260
because it's it's it's the most obvious

627
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,760
Here and Now

628
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,940
so yeah as I said they try to compare

629
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,039
um city of New York but sometimes they

630
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,080
use New York State Etc so what you see

631
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,679
is here the median family income so this

632
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:17,760
kind of

633
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,980
people that are just in the middle of

634
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,020
this distribution this has been

635
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,260
declining over the past I think

636
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,100
um

637
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,799
uh 10 I mean in this case it's kind of

638
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,440
three to four years uh after uh the

639
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,480
creative session right so you see that

640
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,320
2008 2009 2010 2011.

641
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,500
um you find a steep Decline and it's

642
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,200
actually more more pronounced in uh the

643
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,419
city of New York so the city of New York

644
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:48,179
on average the median income was already

645
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,279
much lower than compared to New York

646
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,960
state which is kind of more refers to

647
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,360
the broader agglomeration mostly but

648
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,700
then also the rest of the state and it

649
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,580
was also significantly lower at the

650
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,860
United States so in general there's a

651
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,640
decline in median income uh in the city

652
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,140
of New York

653
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,539
at the same time what we see at the

654
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,360
other kind of sides of the picture is

655
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,200
the share of uh income total income

656
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,260
going to the top one percent and here is

657
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,360
again a comparison between

658
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,159
us and uh red then the state of New York

659
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,100
in green and then New York City kind of

660
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,700
smallest scale in uh blue which is on

661
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,500
top line so it's kind of interesting to

662
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,279
see and this data goes back to the 1980s

663
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,799
um they all share very similar patterns

664
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,200
here at the beginning the share of

665
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,940
income going to the top one percent

666
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,039
that's just reminds yourself one percent

667
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,380
of the entire distribution the top one

668
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,440
percent against the 99 remember

669
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,179
um was about 12 to 30 in the 1980s this

670
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,600
has exploded right so it has grown uh

671
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,760
across all scales

672
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,059
to something modest off you could say uh

673
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:13,020
22 in the US so one percent owns 22 of

674
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,340
all income just reflect on that

675
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,740
um and then in New York we see that

676
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,940
almost 45 most almost half of all income

677
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,399
is owned by the top one percent okay so

678
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,940
we all know Jeff Bezos and others uh but

679
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,159
this is kind of way more systematic yes

680
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,380
yeah

681
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,440
but the previous one yeah that's true I

682
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,899
mean this is just a figure

683
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:55,620
and it's one of these progress of liquid

684
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,159
possessions

685
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,539
yeah that's true that's right I mean

686
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,640
this is kind of you could say

687
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,760
uh the median income has decreased

688
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,360
everywhere uh it does seem to you do

689
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,000
seem to find here I would say that it it

690
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,179
decreases more in New York City compared

691
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,360
to others uh it's it's less you would

692
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,039
have to look at percentages there for

693
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,320
New York state or us but I think it's

694
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,460
it's kind of um going from 59 to 54.

695
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,620
yeah that's a very significant decline

696
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,200
but it's not one-on-one uh comparable no

697
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,320
you're right so this goes back way more

698
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,700
in time

699
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,799
um but the main point being here is that

700
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,260
a very small percentage is actually

701
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,220
running away with a lot of the income

702
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,919
and again indeed you see that here's

703
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,840
connection to what you were asking there

704
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,020
was a decline in general also for these

705
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,620
top one percent uh uh with the global

706
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,200
financial crisis but you also see that

707
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,720
it's kind of very quick rebound of these

708
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,600
highest incomes right so they they kind

709
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,820
of take a hit and that has something to

710
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,460
do probably with their fact that they're

711
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,760
exposed to so much parts of the economy

712
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,799
but then they rebounds uh quite soon

713
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,179
okay uh another kind of graph uh here

714
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,940
comparing New York state to the US so

715
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,519
unfortunately not at the at the city

716
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,000
level but yeah you get an idea here it's

717
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,919
comparing the top five percent in terms

718
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,460
of income and total income with

719
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,059
um

720
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,159
which you could say the bottom green

721
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,360
time so the the 20 uh lowest incomes and

722
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,880
then the middle group right so from 40

723
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,419
to 60 in the distribution so what you

724
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,039
find is that

725
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:47,820
um

726
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,039
over the years

727
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,220
um and this is comparing the late 70s so

728
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,980
you could say the mid 2000s so I mean

729
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,039
it's a dated analysis but that's uh the

730
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,720
furthest that they that they could go in

731
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,120
this analysis in uh the 1970s the ratio

732
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,239
between the top five percent and the

733
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,560
lowest incomes was 7.4 so people in the

734
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,800
top five earned 7.4 times more than

735
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,659
people with the lowest incomes in the

736
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,760
lowest quintile

737
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,239
um by the mid-2000s it had become 17.3

738
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,899
times right so take the income of the

739
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,918
lowest

740
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,179
um uh income households times 17.3 right

741
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,940
so tremendous tremendously growing

742
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,560
difference and it's also when you

743
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,480
compare it to the right growing much

744
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,500
faster uh than what you see in U.S in

745
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,639
general

746
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,280
and it still also pertains to the

747
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,719
relation between the top five percent

748
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,719
and but you could say the middle income

749
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,659
group or the middle class even there is

750
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,760
kind of these disparities have doubled

751
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,760
and they have have increased more uh

752
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,380
when you compare it to the US so it went

753
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:07,080
from 2.9 to 5.3 compared to uh 4.7

754
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,700
um when compared to yes okay so

755
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,500
massively increasing that difference so

756
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,780
it means that there's a growing

757
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,820
concentration of income and a very small

758
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,320
group

759
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,560
another exhibit showing this is uh

760
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,960
comparing the growth in income between

761
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,820
different groups so the bottom quintile

762
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,180
again lowest incomes actually lost a

763
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,880
share in total income

764
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,160
um when you compare the late 90s to the

765
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,020
mid-2000s

766
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,500
there was some growth for middle-income

767
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,960
groups and it was a very large group

768
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,400
that growth 18 to 19 in the income of

769
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,040
the life is good okay so the trends are

770
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,400
kind of clear it was a slow hiccup uh

771
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,800
with the global financial crisis but as

772
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,140
a kind of a secular Trend where a very

773
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,780
small percentage of the population yet

774
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,020
one percent or five percent is gaining

775
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,560
more and more uh share in the total uh

776
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,700
distribution I think

777
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,640
one way of of looking at that is why

778
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,440
that could be and we'll talk about

779
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,720
General patterns also more towards the

780
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,920
end of uh of today's uh session

781
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,619
is looking at what happens

782
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,800
um in evolutions of productivity so with

783
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,020
kind of with one hour of work what kind

784
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,200
of value do you produce how much cookies

785
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,400
do you cut or how much cards do you make

786
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,839
or how much

787
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,460
um you could say transactions Financial

788
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,200
transactions can you uh can you conclude

789
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,940
um versus the income from those

790
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,740
activities so what you see is that from

791
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,180
2001 until uh 2011 here there's actually

792
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,619
a 14 increase in productivity so for the

793
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,520
same hour of work you produce 14 more

794
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,500
wealth if you will

795
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,619
but when you look at the income levels

796
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,980
um from labor annual average real wage

797
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,320
so these are the the salaries that

798
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,579
people get

799
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,700
it has increased a little bit but it has

800
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,440
by no means kept base wet the Rises and

801
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,359
productivity left okay so it's kind of

802
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,859
it's running away

803
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,740
so there's an increase of about what is

804
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,220
it here two three four percent

805
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,460
um as we go across those uh 10 years

806
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,980
okay so that means that something else

807
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,320
is probably happening with the Weld and

808
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,240
value that's being created

809
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,680
and we talked a little bit about

810
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,099
financialization last week it means that

811
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,619
it's if it's not going to labor it's

812
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,599
probably going to the factor of capital

813
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,800
which means shareholders or uh you could

814
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,740
say well remunerated employees such as

815
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,640
CEOs managers who actually take uh a

816
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,619
growing piece off the cake

817
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,940
yeah this is New York

818
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,660
um

819
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,200
we'll get to more global patterns more

820
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,480
towards the end as a kind of an Outlook

821
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,700
exercise

822
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,960
but it's a trend that is that is

823
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,320
occurring across uh across countries

824
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,240
right and there's you probably know the

825
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,700
work of Thomas picketing it may have

826
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,240
rung a bell already uh he and his group

827
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,480
of we could say economic historians

828
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,960
have looked at systematically at income

829
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,520
data and income distribution data uh and

830
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,619
a more long-term perspective and they

831
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,540
yeah they can't compare all countries

832
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,460
because their data sources are limited

833
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,040
but they compare a number of key

834
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,720
European countries uh us UK Australia

835
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,920
etc etc so yeah these are unfortunately

836
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,640
um

837
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,520
patterns we see everywhere but in some

838
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,079
contexts they're more extreme than

839
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,680
elsewhere and US UK and we'll get to

840
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,859
that at some point are the most extreme

841
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,260
cases here

842
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,780
so yeah run away

843
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,599
um productivity but not necessarily more

844
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,460
remuneration

845
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,400
on the other side is and this is I think

846
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,700
a very telling graph is

847
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,640
to what extent uh can you make a living

848
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,599
a decent living if you work full time

849
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,520
on the minimum wage

850
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,980
right this was the analysis and I go

851
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,760
back again to the 1980s is it right

852
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,540
um

853
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,240
yeah or even earlier and you see that

854
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,300
during a substantial period of time if

855
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,460
you worked at the minimum wage

856
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,440
you were well above the poverty line

857
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,579
right so you had like 120 percent uh so

858
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,460
you could live if you will decently and

859
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,680
you wouldn't live in poverty

860
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,079
and this has completely melted away so

861
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,380
uh became uh very bad in the kind of

862
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,260
1990s but even well into today you see

863
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,079
that even if you work uh full time at

864
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,960
this wage you still fall below uh the

865
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,579
poverty line okay so it's kind of

866
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,820
something institutionally is wrong there

867
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,560
and the fiscal policy Institute has been

868
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,020
one of the main I would say Advocates

869
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,599
also for an increase in minimum wages

870
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,820
uh and yeah and a lot of metropolitan

871
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,119
areas also for instance in in London

872
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,640
there's also kind of uh demand for

873
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,119
London living wage uh which sometimes

874
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,420
should be higher uh than in the rest of

875
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,680
the country because the standard of

876
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,500
living it's just more expensive in these

877
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,140
large metropolitan areas okay so a very

878
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,780
dire picture a lot of people at the very

879
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,480
bottom are not only you could you could

880
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,940
say losing out in terms of income levels

881
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,640
it's also still it's not sufficient to

882
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,460
actually make a living uh when you're at

883
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,820
that site of the income distribution

884
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,040
so just to give you a bit of a picture

885
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,619
from this arguably extreme case of the

886
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,260
the sincerity of the situation

887
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,720
uh and yeah you can find this report

888
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,380
online pulling apart uh New York

889
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,420
um and I would recommend that you have a

890
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,579
look at that but I think the conclusion

891
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:36,060
is that we see uh in growing income

892
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,339
polarization in the state of New York

893
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:40,619
more narrowly in New York City

894
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,800
and it's becoming more dramatic than the

895
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,720
US average

896
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,960
okay over to you for another one to two

897
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,540
minutes group thing and I would like to

898
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,119
ask you why it is according to you that

899
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,280
specifically world and Global cities are

900
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,800
becoming so polarized okay and then

901
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,300
we'll take the question straight after

902
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,070
that go ahead

903
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:16,920
[Music]

904
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,820
thank you

905
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,970
again

906
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,820
[Music]

907
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,300
today

908
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,859
okay

909
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:01,099
thank you

910
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,780
I miss you too

911
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,339
[Music]

912
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:51,439
[Music]

913
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:59,599
thank you

914
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,300
okay let's hear it this is what you came

915
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,440
up with

916
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,800
you

917
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,460
[Music]

918
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,540
what did you come up with

919
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,420
yeah

920
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,260
a little areas

921
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,819
so let's speak for four people

922
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,980
so there's a comment about the cost of

923
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,720
living

924
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,760
okay but it's more you could say more a

925
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,220
symptom if you will I mean it's kind of

926
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,000
the price of real estate housing

927
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,640
um daily consumption etc etc

928
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,220
you could say it affects everybody

929
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,740
to a similar degree unless we

930
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,060
acknowledge that there's even more

931
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,040
differences I mean that's that the cost

932
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,079
of living for the rich would be also

933
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:51,780
very high but maybe they can afford it

934
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,060
it's not really an explanation of why we

935
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,720
see polarization I think yep I think a

936
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,520
lot of governments buy into the tripod

937
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,800
and so we see large companies which

938
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,260
already have a lot of capital getting

939
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,240
more subsidies from the government

940
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,859
getting

941
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:11,700
um

942
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,920
place in say special economic zones

943
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,700
where electricity land live around a lot

944
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,520
of things are subsidized uh

945
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,220
they're they're drinking well providing

946
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,180
um

947
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,060
employment however that said employment

948
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,000
the salary is not distributed so you

949
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,260
have the larger companies getting larger

950
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,839
what do you mean with trickle-down

951
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,800
Logics yes so I mean the the rhetoric of

952
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,740
that is of course that if you have a

953
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,440
large company

954
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,060
it provides employment and the ideal

955
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,400
scenario is to be more people with more

956
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,460
money except what often happens is that

957
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,160
the top one percent offset company will

958
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,460
probably get larger income and the

959
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,060
income distribution is quite skewed

960
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,040
so yeah this this important critique I

961
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,720
think that's also what for instance

962
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,180
Doreen Massey was talking about I mean

963
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,000
and throughout her career fighting this

964
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,980
kind of trickle-down Economics principle

965
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,540
and she talks about

966
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,420
because of global cityization

967
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,060
which is actually producing inequalities

968
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,700
which are not it's not just let's wait

969
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,280
for a bit more Global City formation and

970
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,079
it will be eased away

971
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,660
what he actually says no uh this

972
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,060
polarization is an outcome of global

973
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,119
City formation uh it's because you have

974
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,980
certain activities that we will have

975
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,180
this is not something it's something

976
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,940
permanent and not something that will go

977
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,980
away a bit more trickle-down economics

978
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,800
so because economics something with

979
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,780
the fact that you create multipliers

980
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,240
that money circulates to the territory

981
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,540
we can create jobs will then fuel growth

982
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,640
etc etc but little is said about the

983
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,220
income levels of these people uh what

984
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,079
kind of jobs are created what kind of

985
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,480
working circumstance Etc right

986
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,859
okay other ideas

987
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,300
um

988
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,079
capitalism just how do I make the most

989
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:33,000
money as fast as possible and the more

990
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,319
you try to do that and practically

991
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,599
intuition as possible the more exciting

992
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,359
social problems but you know it just it

993
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,420
like self-destructure the same sounds

994
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,980
so there's deliberate corporate

995
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,460
strategies but perhaps they can also be

996
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,859
more viable and some live touch

997
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:51,800
regulations compared to other places

998
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,339
yeah yeah

999
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,680
the

1000
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,780
formulations

1001
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,220
so yeah that's true there's a lot of

1002
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,220
local policy that works towards creating

1003
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,380
some kind of a business climate

1004
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,780
of national policies that are

1005
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,900
restructuring the detection of Labor etc

1006
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,339
etc yeah

1007
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:42,060
I mean I also think that the cities are

1008
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,160
trying to struggle to attract global

1009
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,800
companies and that at the end global

1010
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,020
companies They Don't Really enrich City

1011
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,880
budgets with the taxes because they

1012
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,240
either evade it either the city trying

1013
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,460
to once again attract those local

1014
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,099
companies trying to subsidize them in

1015
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,400
terms of substitute but then

1016
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,680
like taxes is something to support the

1017
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,079
lower weight of the more like insecure

1018
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:09,720
parts of the population and then like

1019
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,480
they uh like a low-income workers they

1020
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,040
don't get the support of the city

1021
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:17,940
okay let's

1022
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,800
there was a lot of answers from there so

1023
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,359
spatial redistribution yeah

1024
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,839
Taxation and also creating social

1025
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:34,079
policies so this is something in one of

1026
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,839
the tasks he just mentions it's very

1027
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:39,020
briefly about the uh develop

1028
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,160
developmental State something like this

1029
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,859
like this uh this process has changed in

1030
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,560
things that have a more active role and

1031
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,640
I think it's going to be something that

1032
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,400
also shapes this polarization absolutely

1033
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,599
yeah foreign

1034
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,839
but you know there's a maybe a

1035
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,300
concentration of people who derived a

1036
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,680
larger portion of their income from

1037
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,079
financialization

1038
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,079
foreign

1039
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,180
because I mean we also have to

1040
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,280
distinguish between uh say processes

1041
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,020
that work across the entire territory

1042
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,020
they say okay what holds for countries

1043
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,060
and what is so specific about some

1044
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,619
places that they seem to be more

1045
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,540
polarized than the rest of the country

1046
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,619
okay yeah

1047
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:01,819
minimum

1048
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,200
thank you

1049
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:12,119
easily removed

1050
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,760
[Music]

1051
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,300
awesome yeah uh at the end at the back

1052
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,280
sorry sorry

1053
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,119
um

1054
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,940
yeah I was thinking about following the

1055
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,000
responsibility for social reproduction

1056
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,160
has been privatized and put on to the

1057
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,440
individuals so especially in places like

1058
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,359
the US where there's continual crises

1059
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,339
it's extremely hard for the working

1060
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,619
classes

1061
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:39,380
of course with responsibilities

1062
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,839
and then also like a privatization of

1063
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:45,420
of column is going to do

1064
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,339
and different quality

1065
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:49,079
can you say a bit more about social

1066
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,300
reproduction because it's a very

1067
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,400
analytical term or kind of almost

1068
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,440
theoretical term what do you mean with

1069
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,880
that

1070
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,400
um just like things like

1071
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,099
um everything from Healthcare to taking

1072
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,660
care of children

1073
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,680
um yeah you know feeding your family

1074
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,119
having them enough money for utilities

1075
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,859
and things like that

1076
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,140
right so and when it comes to the system

1077
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,780
the worker itself needs to be produced

1078
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,480
in a social way uh it's not a good time

1079
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,119
making the worker I mean physically but

1080
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,720
also educating the worker feeding uh I

1081
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,700
mean kind of educating and socializing

1082
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,740
them into a particular uh working

1083
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,960
culture yeah

1084
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,960
um

1085
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:48,440
I guess ideas Rich the richest

1086
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,660
before I feel like places where that is

1087
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,819
more accepted like in the UK there's

1088
00:52:53,819 --> 00:52:56,700
like hot dogs like reality TV for

1089
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,020
example like

1090
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,599
um big brother like benefit the street

1091
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:03,300
it like kind of created the idea that

1092
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,220
the poor are just like messy people who

1093
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,880
kind of think about their property

1094
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,680
oh yeah

1095
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,319
I I would agree but I think then the

1096
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:14,700
question is to what extent would it play

1097
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,420
out more in an urban context than say in

1098
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,180
I don't know rural Britain maybe because

1099
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,180
it's poverty is is less present there

1100
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,520
although I would like to see a map of

1101
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,819
that but yeah I think the power of new

1102
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:32,040
liberal ideas is clearly going to but

1103
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,660
okay one final idea

1104
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,139
[Music]

1105
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,400
um

1106
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,760
so it has something to do with them

1107
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,220
perhaps with um existing solidarity

1108
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,160
networks it would extends there's still

1109
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,040
solidarity between people uh and what

1110
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,720
extent the urban environment still

1111
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,520
supports that

1112
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,400
you've covered quite a bit of ground I I

1113
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,859
don't have it in my slides all of that

1114
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:31,079
but I think it shows what you can do

1115
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,359
collectively in trying to um try to pick

1116
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,520
up this puzzle so so thank you for that

1117
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,160
what I just want to do is is take you to

1118
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,260
a number of slides because I think try

1119
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,240
to gather a number of elements and then

1120
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,540
work towards this polarization thesis

1121
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,839
however fullable it is uh we'll try to

1122
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:51,059
try to get there and then we'll take a

1123
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:52,920
short break

1124
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,079
so yeah uh conceptualization

1125
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,960
uh have been written about this uh I

1126
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,700
I've been mostly referring to the global

1127
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,160
City but there's plenty of other kind of

1128
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,980
scholarship on that uh as you can see in

1129
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,140
this picture it has been one of the main

1130
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,280
kind of

1131
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,180
um

1132
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,960
um you could say theorized conceptualize

1133
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,300
uh problems of contemporary cities and

1134
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,640
something with yeah what you do with

1135
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,520
this uh with these dualities

1136
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,339
um John monkov and Manuel constells

1137
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:28,680
talked about dual City Susan Feinstein

1138
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,680
wrote by divided cities Peter Marcus

1139
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,960
another great scholar talk about quarter

1140
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,800
cities

1141
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,200
uh Buddhists talked about fragmented

1142
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,319
cities Etc so it's kind of has been one

1143
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,300
of the main debates in urban social

1144
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,079
geography but it seems that uh all these

1145
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,079
kind of uh things necessarily or or most

1146
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,660
emblematically start to connect

1147
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,900
um to cities rather than wider uh wider

1148
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,119
territories and

1149
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,400
um and and a lot of people start to look

1150
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,480
for

1151
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,339
um particular answers as I said last

1152
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:04,140
week I tend to go back to the 80s

1153
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,020
because it's kind of my my natural

1154
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,760
cohort

1155
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,760
um but quite often people go back to the

1156
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,339
60s the 70s and this kind of wider

1157
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:17,880
restructuration of of cities and wider

1158
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,599
economies and we could say uh the North

1159
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,460
Atlantic sphere so it's

1160
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,440
I mean there's a lot of things have been

1161
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,420
written there's a rich scholarship but

1162
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,660
arguments it's kind of biased if you

1163
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,020
will to say the crisis of cities or the

1164
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,660
the crisis cities have underwent

1165
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,059
in Western Europe Northern America okay

1166
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:41,099
so there's plenty of stuff that needs to

1167
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:44,339
be written uh on on the histories and

1168
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:47,339
these historical trajectories uh of say

1169
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:51,780
Chinese cities uh African cities etc etc

1170
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,800
um

1171
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,559
but it's not something that uh that I

1172
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:59,220
can now cover uh today okay but

1173
00:56:59,220 --> 00:56:59,960
um

1174
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,180
it's yeah kind of the general narrative

1175
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,400
that you find in these different uh kind

1176
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,740
of analysis is that the economic

1177
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,020
restructuring kind of started uh in the

1178
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,119
1960s 70s when

1179
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,579
there's a culmination of the crisis of

1180
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:16,619
what they call North Atlantic fortism

1181
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:19,619
and as I I think explained last week or

1182
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:21,599
two weeks ago

1183
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,420
um there was this system of regulating

1184
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,940
capitalism where there was a deal say

1185
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,000
between the workers and capital that

1186
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,140
increased productivity would uh

1187
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,700
um that the fruits of that and the

1188
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,319
surface of that would be shared with

1189
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:40,440
workers okay this is kind of Ford going

1190
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,980
back to to Henry Ford uh he he paid his

1191
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,440
workers a little bit more

1192
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,119
um so they would be more productive but

1193
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:50,520
they could actually in fact also buy the

1194
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,160
cars that they were producing uh at the

1195
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,140
at the hellish speed okay so that was

1196
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,839
kind of the Wilder model uh we saw the

1197
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,579
emergence of the middle classes in the

1198
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:02,640
immediate post-war era everybody could

1199
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,000
could buy uh consumer goods because of

1200
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
rising productivity levels uh it was the

1201
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,280
invention of free time to actually spend

1202
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,680
your money and consume it and so I can

1203
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,500
actually go to shop Shops and and buy

1204
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,099
stuff at some point this model kind of

1205
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:22,619
started to crumble there were problems

1206
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:24,059
with

1207
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:26,579
um with productivity it couldn't keep up

1208
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:29,940
with Rising uh wages

1209
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,460
and kind of them at the macro level the

1210
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,960
solution was

1211
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,319
a relocation of production uh and you

1212
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:38,819
could say the start point of

1213
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:41,280
globalization the new international

1214
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,880
division of labor the effect was that

1215
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,980
there was de-industrialization and you

1216
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,079
could say the core of the world economy

1217
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:53,099
is high income industrialized places so

1218
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:54,960
again we're talking about Northern

1219
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,540
America Western Europe mostly

1220
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,660
and it's set in motion the process of uh

1221
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,819
structural and employment

1222
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:04,380
which was

1223
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,720
felt throughout countries and

1224
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,020
territories but was very very Urban uh

1225
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,880
in many contexts there was a lot of

1226
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,220
productive activities within cities

1227
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,680
um and as these active moved away became

1228
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,940
obsolete what happened is that you could

1229
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,619
say Urban poverty and unemployment

1230
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:28,559
became very much Urban phenomena so

1231
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,720
cities lost their functions productive

1232
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,859
functions

1233
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,420
but they had to deal with a lot of

1234
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:36,540
things say the costs of unemployment etc

1235
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,079
etc so we have a decline in tax base and

1236
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,500
in many contexts what you see is a shift

1237
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,700
towards

1238
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,640
austerity so there's less income

1239
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,119
so this budget cuts etc etc so the whole

1240
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,480
idea and the immediate post-war era was

1241
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,660
a strong Indian state so you had mass

1242
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,880
production Mass consumption but also

1243
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,680
with states that was inspired by John

1244
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,079
men and he said okay if there's an issue

1245
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,559
with uh with consumption

1246
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:10,680
well the the government itself will be

1247
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,099
the first investor will make sure that

1248
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:16,980
um that the economy keeps on going that

1249
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,660
kind of changed in the spirit as well

1250
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,640
the state was seen as something that had

1251
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,059
to roll back its activities stop

1252
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:27,240
interfering uh with all kinds of uh

1253
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,299
market-based processes and so this kind

1254
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:32,940
of the starting point of uh the

1255
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,760
neoliberal ideology

1256
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,680
uh whereas the state was still kind of

1257
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,040
setting the rules of Market uh Market

1258
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,480
systems

1259
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,540
it stopped indeed providing for instance

1260
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,880
a whole range of public goods that that

1261
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,280
were mentioned in many countries okay so

1262
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,040
most of I mean accentuated this took

1263
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,440
place in the US and the UK you could say

1264
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,480
the new liberal heartlands or the

1265
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,000
leading examples of that with uh that

1266
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,700
Margaret Thatcher Ronald Reagan

1267
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,400
but it started to creep in an effect it

1268
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,099
became some kind of a mobile policy that

1269
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:10,319
was also in practice being implemented

1270
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,420
in other contexts

1271
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,180
sometimes to a lesser extent in a more

1272
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,579
variegated way etc etc and the whole

1273
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:21,059
research agenda by Francis Jamie pack a

1274
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:23,640
very nice uh and one of the leading

1275
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,400
scorers in in urban geography

1276
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,339
is about that so what is neoliberalism

1277
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:32,520
what is neoliberalization is it the same

1278
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,160
everywhere how variegated is it how does

1279
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,720
it connect itself to different kind of

1280
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,700
contexts that's that's the whole thing

1281
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,700
so we see those ideas spreading a lot

1282
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,859
across a lot of these say Western

1283
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:46,799
European North American states

1284
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,559
um and in in one way or another it leads

1285
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:52,260
to some kind of to a self-fulfilling

1286
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:55,200
prophecy because as the state Retreats

1287
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,140
from certain areas

1288
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,200
it deregulates very often

1289
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,140
um a lot of these uh these markets which

1290
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,260
hands more power to large corporations

1291
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,720
and we already talked about uh

1292
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,079
multinational corporations uh last week

1293
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:16,020
and we see a rising concentration of

1294
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,599
power of industrial and financial

1295
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:22,380
conglomerations etc etc and indeed in

1296
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,720
the process where also the state is kind

1297
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,160
of rescaled where a lot of

1298
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,680
responsibilities are kind of pushed to

1299
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,440
the local level you get some kind of a

1300
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,900
self-fulfilling Mantra of competing

1301
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,799
cities to attract Global capital okay so

1302
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,819
that's kind of the situation where a lot

1303
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:44,220
of policy makers you could say in the

1304
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,980
80s end of the

1305
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,059
1980s were kind of facing uh a kind of

1306
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:53,880
zero-sum game where there's only so much

1307
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,700
production for instance to take place so

1308
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,460
Amazon will uh will have its Center

1309
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,920
either here or it will go across the

1310
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,180
border and what can we do about that

1311
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,619
well

1312
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:10,559
David Harvey is one of the the the main

1313
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,619
uh scholars in this area he says well

1314
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:16,079
what we see that a lot of our policy

1315
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,599
makers are trying to do is they try to

1316
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:22,559
become entrepreneurial right so whereas

1317
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,180
they were managing

1318
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,760
the territories and trying to think

1319
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,319
about

1320
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,740
um the spatial structures of welfare uh

1321
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,780
amenities and to distribute growth

1322
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,880
across the territory you kind of get the

1323
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,059
flip side a much more competitive idea

1324
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:41,880
about growth and a new kind of role for

1325
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,220
people that were previously managing

1326
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,079
territories to become some kind of

1327
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,240
entrepreneurs right

1328
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,000
and David Harvey talks about this in his

1329
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,579
famous piece and I think uh people and

1330
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,500
miss and four cities also discussed this

1331
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:00,660
with um with Matthew uh from uh he

1332
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,160
describes the shift from Urban

1333
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,839
managerialism to Urban

1334
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,640
entrepreneurialism where you get a

1335
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,680
different kind of mindset with policy

1336
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,880
now

1337
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,640
okay so this is kind of the Mantra is a

1338
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,200
bit structuralist but it's kind of the

1339
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,960
reasoning of how you could say macro

1340
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,900
phenomena at some point lead to a very

1341
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,599
particular Urban reality

1342
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:26,760
um and what David Harvey then does and

1343
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,280
this is a kind of a short excurse that I

1344
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,619
want to take you through what it does it

1345
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:33,180
says okay in this competitive

1346
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,280
circumstances

1347
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,780
we see that policy makers start to adopt

1348
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,599
a number of strategies and a number of

1349
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:44,339
entrepreneurial strategies and I'll take

1350
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:45,960
you through them

1351
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,900
be advised and sometimes it kind of

1352
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,400
interesting to see that people think

1353
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,280
there's kind of some kind of a recipe by

1354
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,319
David Harvey say if your cities in

1355
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:58,740
trouble please consider applying this

1356
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,020
strategy this is not what David Harvey

1357
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,540
does he kind of observes and analyzes

1358
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,900
this phenomena he's not prescribing some

1359
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,760
kind of entrepreneurial strategies that

1360
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,680
then should be implemented by policy

1361
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,160
makers just to be clear which reminds me

1362
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,859
of an anecdote David Harvey I think once

1363
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:20,280
gave a lecture in New York and he I

1364
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,819
think he's famous for his analysis or

1365
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,240
reading of of thus Capital

1366
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,540
by Michael Marx volume one has very nice

1367
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,819
videos on that he has a companion to

1368
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:33,619
Capital

1369
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:35,880
uh and also gave a lecture about that

1370
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,040
somewhere in New York and apparently

1371
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,260
there were also some investment bankers

1372
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,859
in the room and after the lecture his

1373
01:05:43,859 --> 01:05:45,599
investment bank has walked up to him and

1374
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,940
said well Mr Harvey I think you have a

1375
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,619
very good understanding of how Finance

1376
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:51,720
Capital Works would it be possible

1377
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,850
possible to hire you as a consultant

1378
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,559
[Music]

1379
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:58,920
um I think he declined but yeah just to

1380
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,200
be very clear I mean it's

1381
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,119
um it's an analysis that he provides

1382
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,819
it's not a recipe that it thinks that

1383
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:08,579
should be installed okay all right

1384
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:09,299
um

1385
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,980
so yeah I mean the first kind of thing

1386
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,660
that is under pressure if you will is

1387
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,940
these productive activities or what it

1388
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,559
sees is that

1389
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,079
um some policy makers still manage to

1390
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:21,839
kind of keep productive activities in

1391
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,480
their territories and I mean that still

1392
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,220
there will be some public and private

1393
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,380
Investments and you could say the

1394
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,660
physical and social base

1395
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,000
um uh of course physical and social

1396
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,039
infrastructure so think about knowledge

1397
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,700
networks educational facilities uh try

1398
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,520
to build Venture Capital sometimes the

1399
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,020
state becomes some kind of venture

1400
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,200
capitalist itself uh but indeed as has

1401
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,720
been described also try to work on all

1402
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,780
the things that are too costly uh

1403
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,780
um reduce excessive labor costs for

1404
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,520
instance

1405
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,480
um tax breaks etc etc and that quite

1406
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,819
often kind of leading the idea is that

1407
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:04,740
the city regions should become yeah

1408
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:07,500
silicon valleys uh that that should be

1409
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,780
the ambition that they should seek to

1410
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:12,000
attract Capital people

1411
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,280
um sometimes this kind of set to attract

1412
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,920
the creative class to refer to Richard

1413
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,579
Florida but it's kind of this idea that

1414
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:23,819
yes a high-tech productive city is still

1415
01:07:23,819 --> 01:07:27,599
mad imaginable and we have to create the

1416
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,579
right business environment to get there

1417
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:33,180
okay so images of clusters and there's a

1418
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,940
lot of cluster policy but it used to be

1419
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,980
I think in a lot of cities

1420
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,359
it's also the reason why you had

1421
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,780
dedicated districts Edge cities uh

1422
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,839
linked to healthcare or biotech

1423
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:49,319
etc etc so that's kind of one strategy

1424
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:52,140
that is still imaginable for cities

1425
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,660
the second element entrepreneurial

1426
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,000
strategy is to compete for consumption

1427
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,599
yeah so people have money to spend

1428
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,859
there's a spatial division of

1429
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:03,720
consumption what you want is that people

1430
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,140
spend their dollars Euros uh rupees in

1431
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:10,500
your country and your city and not in

1432
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,539
the neighboring City okay

1433
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:14,700
and obviously with globalization this

1434
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,259
this kind of changes you see the

1435
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,540
emergence of global tourism flows etc

1436
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,759
etc so there's a kind of battle if you

1437
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:23,339
will to attract tourists retirees

1438
01:08:23,339 --> 01:08:26,939
there's a whole economy behind Elderly

1439
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:29,759
Homes uh because well these are people

1440
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,120
who have pensions still and they provide

1441
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,219
a safe stream of income

1442
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:36,000
um

1443
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,339
and you could say local consumption

1444
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:39,540
activities

1445
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,520
now there's a contradiction in

1446
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,738
capitalism there because with the crisis

1447
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:47,698
of fordism uh we see a decline in

1448
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:51,000
purchasing power the factor labor is

1449
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,880
typically less powerful

1450
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,920
um so yeah there's there's less less

1451
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,620
money to spend people don't really see

1452
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:02,279
uh an increase in their in their uh real

1453
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:05,880
wages as we've seen in the picture uh on

1454
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,520
New York but this goes back to the 1970s

1455
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,080
for instance when you see pictures of

1456
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,160
the US

1457
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,560
there has been hardly any increase in

1458
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,140
real wages despite huge productivity

1459
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,060
growth okay

1460
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,759
um so this conundrum in many cases being

1461
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:23,120
resolved by

1462
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,960
reverting to uh to credit basically

1463
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,859
um

1464
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:31,500
so instead of kind of buying it from the

1465
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,238
salary that you have

1466
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:34,679
there's an increase to say

1467
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:36,899
financialization of the economy in the

1468
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:39,020
sense that a lot of households become

1469
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,179
dependent on credits mostly through

1470
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:46,859
banks to obtain housing but increasingly

1471
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:49,198
also all other kinds of consumption

1472
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:52,500
Goods Goods washing machines cars etc

1473
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,540
etc

1474
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:56,520
so this is kind of one way of solving

1475
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,340
that that contradiction

1476
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:02,160
um it's also uh trying to attract High

1477
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,460
income jobs uh because yeah they have a

1478
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,040
lot of money to spend uh and what form

1479
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,400
does it take well in many cases uh it

1480
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,080
will have some impact on the social

1481
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,719
spatial structure uh it could be either

1482
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:18,420
state-led gentrification it could be

1483
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,000
market-based gentrification

1484
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,560
um in many cases what you will see is

1485
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,440
that cities will try to uh become more

1486
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,540
attractive one way or another by using

1487
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:31,380
Heritage uh architecture and these are

1488
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,120
things that that you will also talk with

1489
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,640
with boss about cities are kind of

1490
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,260
transformed into these kind of urban

1491
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,280
spectacles that are

1492
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,860
collectively adding more value to the

1493
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,020
goods that are consumed there so if you

1494
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,280
walk around from the spectacular

1495
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,800
neighborhood you might be inclined to

1496
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,000
spend a bit more yes

1497
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,040
yes

1498
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,739
very also really increase the work of

1499
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:07,760
the city like the one in

1500
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:16,739
library and before that the seat was

1501
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:17,520
very

1502
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,860
popular and everyone was not really an

1503
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,719
attraction and part of it

1504
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:24,179
was very interesting yeah yeah yeah no

1505
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:25,860
but it's it's kind of these these

1506
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,620
examples of of landmark buildings uh

1507
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,659
they're they're quite often they're used

1508
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:32,340
in large scale reconversion number one

1509
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,980
is is I think maybe you refer to Bilbao

1510
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,800
all right that's Northern Spain yeah so

1511
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,280
there was an old Industrial Area uh and

1512
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,340
I think it's in the 1990s already

1513
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,840
spectacular urbanism in the sense that

1514
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,060
spectacular architecture usually there's

1515
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,640
some kind of a mobile class of what they

1516
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,340
call start attacks uh who are kind of

1517
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,699
foreign

1518
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:02,219
who connect to these Global circuits and

1519
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:03,960
starts producing these kind of

1520
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,080
spectacular architectural forms that

1521
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,179
then send the message to the world which

1522
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:11,640
can be then uh kind of linked to City

1523
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,460
branding or city marketing strategies

1524
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,800
Etc so the city in and of itself can be

1525
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,920
consumed but also plays a role in

1526
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,699
fueling consumption practices within

1527
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:25,800
okay so that's kind of if you're

1528
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,500
interested uh to hire David Hardy for

1529
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,719
that he can advise you how to do that

1530
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,440
and then the third third one is what he

1531
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,420
says he said there's still

1532
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,760
an element of the previous system there

1533
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,460
but it's kind of transformed so and you

1534
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,300
could say foreign

1535
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,580
to kind of stimulate growth it was still

1536
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,860
capitalist growth for sure across the

1537
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,159
territory somewhat evenly

1538
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:55,620
um so yeah there's you could say General

1539
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,140
taxation there's a fund and it can be

1540
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:01,080
invested across the territory and lower

1541
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,900
level governments can still try to

1542
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,840
attract some of that funding but it

1543
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,060
becomes increasingly you could say

1544
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,360
marketized as well quite often you'll be

1545
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,400
competing with other cities and other

1546
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,100
regions to start to attract these kinds

1547
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,100
of redistributed funds

1548
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,739
um just a number of examples in the U.S

1549
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:25,440
it's it's about where our military and

1550
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,199
defense Investments being made that's

1551
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,480
the story of Silicon Valley in Europe

1552
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,860
there's a lot of competition between

1553
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,420
regions

1554
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,140
um

1555
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,679
for for instance a regional development

1556
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,760
funds which work on both competitiveness

1557
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,659
of of regions but also cohesion so it's

1558
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:47,460
not kind of

1559
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,880
100 evil or something like that but it's

1560
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,620
a mechanism uh to yeah to redistribute

1561
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,719
um these kind of Investments across the

1562
01:13:57,719 --> 01:13:59,820
territory but increase you could say the

1563
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:02,040
capacity of these places for growth and

1564
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,140
at the same time also work towards

1565
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,179
providing amenities

1566
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:08,460
uh Child Care etc etc people that are

1567
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,860
joining me on Friday I'll say a little

1568
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,659
bit more about that in relation to

1569
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:14,940
Brussels the canalso for instance is one

1570
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,460
of these zones of actions uh for the

1571
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:20,580
European uh Regional development effect

1572
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,140
when you look for instance people that

1573
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,420
know Flanders a little bit

1574
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,699
um you have stops feeling spray actin

1575
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:28,739
urban renewal projects

1576
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:31,739
it's kind of led by Flanders

1577
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:32,580
um

1578
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:36,239
and it's it's basically giving money to

1579
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:41,340
uh to cities to reconvert Inner City

1580
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:44,340
neighborhoods okay and quite often you

1581
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:47,280
have to apply uh either you say okay I'm

1582
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,280
going to hand in a concept note so you

1583
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,620
get some some funding to develop your

1584
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,780
idea and then perhaps if you're

1585
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,300
successful later on you can attract uh

1586
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,179
funding by uh by the Flemish government

1587
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,179
but thus far you see that it's mostly uh

1588
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:05,880
the Central City Central stadium so the

1589
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,100
main agglomerations that have the main

1590
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,040
capacity also to apply uh for these

1591
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,179
funds so

1592
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:14,400
it's not that all small cities can

1593
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,219
actually uh benefit from that okay there

1594
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:18,840
was a question

1595
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,840
um

1596
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,600
specifically is redistration Surplus

1597
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,719
like looking at both electric economies

1598
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:31,560
like governments are just financing that

1599
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,800
they're all running down so they're all

1600
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,380
running

1601
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:39,000
deficits yeah deficits so I mean it is

1602
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,260
that's an interesting like just looking

1603
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:43,739
at it like Surplus but really it's like

1604
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,800
making choices about where we're going

1605
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,340
yeah yeah who's going to pay for the

1606
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,860
future yeah but that's yeah okay so

1607
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,780
there's a question okay uh governments

1608
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,280
don't have money how can you be talking

1609
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,780
about Surplus I think what I'm talking

1610
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,340
about is the service that is being

1611
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:02,219
created uh in the economy which is not

1612
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:04,679
necessarily the same as the government

1613
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:06,020
budget

1614
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,420
uh which is under conditions of what I

1615
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:12,540
would call permanent austerity is is

1616
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,580
kept small and then the only thing that

1617
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,739
you can do is is yeah say okay we're

1618
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,560
going to become more efficient and

1619
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,040
that's a a mantra that you hear often or

1620
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,860
basically have very small cuts across

1621
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:29,400
the board so I think uh it used to be

1622
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,260
you could say more

1623
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,320
um in the previous especially to for the

1624
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,540
70s or something like that it's the

1625
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:40,260
allocation problem was smaller because

1626
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:43,440
the fiscal base was was larger there was

1627
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,960
more economic growth which could be more

1628
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,020
easily taxed without you could say

1629
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,600
hurting corporations or people or

1630
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,040
workers it's only at the point uh where

1631
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,980
um you could say and yeah there was a

1632
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:01,800
kind of stagnation of profits that it

1633
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,800
became very hard for governments

1634
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,120
um

1635
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,719
yeah to how would I put this to um to

1636
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:11,880
maintain fiscal levels

1637
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,520
without eating into the profits of of

1638
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,960
the corporations that were still there

1639
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,640
so it's kind of a

1640
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,159
yeah it became a very awkward situation

1641
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:23,100
uh so they they rather kind of cut back

1642
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:27,060
on on expenditures running to increase

1643
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,880
um for instance corporate tax rates so

1644
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,520
that could have been one way of dealing

1645
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,820
with that thinking about uh

1646
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,739
um raising productivity levels in

1647
01:17:37,739 --> 01:17:39,960
another way by investing in technology

1648
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,360
etc etc and that has happened to some

1649
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,179
extent but it hasn't been the answer uh

1650
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:47,280
across the board I think the main

1651
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,520
I would say Trend was to

1652
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,219
keep a check on on the on the wages of

1653
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:55,620
people so yeah that's when I when I talk

1654
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,960
about Surplus is kind of more what kind

1655
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,640
of wealth is created within the

1656
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,500
capitalist system

1657
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,199
rather than more in accountancy terms

1658
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:07,020
what's the does the government run a

1659
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:10,380
surplus or a benefit or or a deficit

1660
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,219
um yeah just to be be clear there

1661
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:17,280
um but yeah despite the fact that even

1662
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,380
if there's the smaller budgets available

1663
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,900
and so the allocation mechanism has

1664
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,800
changed it has become less kind of

1665
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,020
an element of how would I put this

1666
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,880
managing

1667
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,159
kind of growth across the territory it

1668
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,980
has become more of a of a competition

1669
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,080
really and you see for instance these

1670
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,760
urban renewal projects as long as

1671
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,520
there's a competition

1672
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:44,219
to attract These funds to your city

1673
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:47,400
um and that's yeah then you see that it

1674
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,620
leads to some kind of uh Winner Takes a

1675
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:51,900
doll phenomenon I mean Flemish

1676
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,640
government is reflexive about that so

1677
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,440
it's not extreme that it's all to one

1678
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,300
city but still there's a tendency that

1679
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,760
some cities benefit a bit more from that

1680
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,800
than others that's

1681
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,239
that's always dependence

1682
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,600
um yeah

1683
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,900
um I'm taking a lot of time then the the

1684
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,900
next uh kind of final one and then we

1685
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,900
kind of end the excurs and go back

1686
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,600
um to the discussion about command and

1687
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,699
control and world cities the kind of

1688
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:24,360
final strategy is to make sure that in

1689
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,100
the international division of labor in

1690
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,540
these Global production networks and

1691
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,580
Global Financial networks that you hold

1692
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,100
these functions of command and control

1693
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,620
and you can say there's a specific kind

1694
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,960
of entrepreneurialism well you're invest

1695
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,239
in physical connectivity digital

1696
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:43,560
connectivity uh nowadays uh that you

1697
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,659
invest in you could say supply side

1698
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:48,480
economics I heard that a little bit uh

1699
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:53,000
so state of the Arts uh districts

1700
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:55,679
that are there to attract International

1701
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,840
corporations and

1702
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,940
development Central Business districts

1703
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,640
that what I mean with that

1704
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,400
also invest in educating the labor force

1705
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,500
uh thinking about installing business

1706
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,659
schools for instance in Frankfurt one of

1707
01:20:09,659 --> 01:20:13,380
the uh the leading Financial Center in

1708
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,600
um in Germany

1709
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,300
um due to University it has its business

1710
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,760
school financed by Deutsche Bank right

1711
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,280
so and there's lectures uh by people

1712
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,100
working at Deutsche Bank

1713
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:29,100
educating the new generation of critical

1714
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,640
uh social scientists okay

1715
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,620
um so this kind of a dynamic that's

1716
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,480
particularly attaching itself to world

1717
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,120
cities and the kind of idea is that if

1718
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,699
you attract these Global functions it

1719
01:20:41,699 --> 01:20:44,460
will indeed set in motion some kind of a

1720
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,080
trickle-down effect

1721
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,380
it will inflate property prices because

1722
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,659
they will as we have learned with Brad

1723
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:54,420
Christophers they will become a part of

1724
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,280
international portfolios

1725
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:00,060
etc etc so that's kind of the strategy

1726
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,360
that is set there

1727
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,780
okay let's have a quick break uh five

1728
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,520
minutes and then we actually get to the

1729
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,340
polarization thesis which is taking a

1730
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,120
lot of time today

1731
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:20,719
a little bit yeah

1732
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:28,880
thank you

1733
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,880
okay

1734
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:33,440
[Music]

1735
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,900
uh yeah

1736
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,540
um can I do the screen you can send me

1737
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,679
an email

1738
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:43,140
or maybe what I can do is just but I

1739
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:46,940
want to avoid that kind of um

1740
01:21:53,179 --> 01:21:56,100
or you can just shout and say who is

1741
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,330
bueno no no no no

1742
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:00,500
[Music]

1743
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,420
okay yeah I think they have that same

1744
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,340
problem as far because I don't know who

1745
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:07,440
is presenting with me this weekend I

1746
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,719
don't have any ways

1747
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:12,540
thank you ma'am yeah yeah yeah but

1748
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:16,520
normally you can see it uh on canvas

1749
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,440
yeah

1750
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,360
okay and it's probably because

1751
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,800
the people in the other group

1752
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,420
uh I'll add email addresses

um

1767
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,480
because

1768
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:37,260
it wasn't something yeah

[Music]

1775
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:40,639
okay let's reconvene

1776
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,320
let's get started again

1777
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:02,480
okay

1778
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,179
so we have this brief excurs learning

1779
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:08,040
about different entrepreneurial

1780
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,080
strategies and I think what I wanted to

1781
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,340
show is that

1782
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:14,219
thank you there's there's a wide

1783
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:16,560
restructuring of the economy and we can

1784
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,560
place growing Global City formation

1785
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,540
within that as one particular strategy

1786
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,920
okay

1787
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,440
or one particular process that is

1788
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,920
explicitly relevant for world cities

1789
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,560
now going back a little bit more to the

1790
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,060
discussion about how does this connect

1791
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,780
to polarization

1792
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:39,239
well as we found there's this and it's

1793
01:29:39,239 --> 01:29:41,159
mostly Friedman and wolf Friedman and

1794
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:42,860
system

1795
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:45,659
uh the starting point was this

1796
01:29:45,659 --> 01:29:48,239
observation of a change in the economic

1797
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:51,540
base generally a decline and well-paid

1798
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:54,000
manufacturing jobs which is some kind of

1799
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,580
an exodus because of globalization of

1800
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:57,480
production

1801
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,900
and at the same time a restructuring of

1802
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:05,159
the economy uh towards services

1803
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:08,219
as we've seen 80 percent of cities is

1804
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:11,159
service based but it's both at the high

1805
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:13,620
end and at the low end both formal

1806
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:16,020
Services service markets and informal

1807
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:18,199
service

1808
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:22,620
so what kind of polarization thesis says

1809
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,120
well there's something particular about

1810
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,719
these commands and control functions

1811
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:28,860
uh

1812
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:31,800
fuels this polarization process please

1813
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,460
take a seat

1814
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,400
okay

1815
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:48,440
[Music]

1816
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:52,340
please do a refill

1817
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,679
so there's something particular about

1818
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,500
these APS and headquarters economies

1819
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,560
that will set a motion polarization

1820
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,420
process okay

1821
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,520
so at one point there's you could say

1822
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,340
competition within the APN APS complex

1823
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:11,460
itself which will lead to

1824
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,800
an idea of Outsourcing getting rid of

1825
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,380
some kind of non-core activities

1826
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:20,940
quite often this leads to low-key kind

1827
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:24,060
of activities that are all and a lot of

1828
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,880
contexts also linked to some form of

1829
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,639
informal economy

1830
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:31,440
and a lot of kind of Migrant labor that

1831
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,040
takes care of routine service charts

1832
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,020
think about cleaning functions think

1833
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:38,400
about

1834
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,639
um well the Xerox machine and those kind

1835
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:45,600
of things clerical work etc etc

1836
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,300
next to that what you also see is that

1837
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,239
with these high-end functions or these

1838
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:53,040
command and control functions

1839
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,760
it comes with uh the influx of

1840
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,639
wealth salaries people that have a lot

1841
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,120
of spending power that have their own

1842
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:05,699
desire for certain forms of of housing

1843
01:32:05,699 --> 01:32:08,820
quite often the sets in motion bursts of

1844
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:11,040
gentrification so the displacement of

1845
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,100
initial populations

1846
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,719
um and it's also at the level of

1847
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:18,540
consumption Goods of of leisure

1848
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,280
activities that this leads to a

1849
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,560
transformation okay so if you host these

1850
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,960
activities well basically the managers

1851
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,600
the CEOs people in Business Services

1852
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,179
Advanced producer Services well they

1853
01:32:30,179 --> 01:32:31,980
have the whole Ecology of cultural

1854
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:35,400
amenities and hurricane Etc uh so

1855
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,199
there's this also creates some kind of

1856
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,420
demand for

1857
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,139
um low-income jobs to cater quite

1858
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:46,500
literally to these uh Elites there is

1859
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,020
something particular about world cities

1860
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:52,320
which makes that there will be a even

1861
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,159
more augmented process of polarization

1862
01:32:55,159 --> 01:32:59,760
compared to non-world cities or

1863
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:00,300
um

1864
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:03,239
or wider territories okay and the end

1865
01:33:03,239 --> 01:33:06,000
result the ideas is that you get with

1866
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,360
you get a a different structure or

1867
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,340
income distribution in the sense that

1868
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,040
there's a lot of growth of jobs at the

1869
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:17,159
very top there's a growth of jobs at the

1870
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:19,320
at the bottom of the income distribution

1871
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:23,040
and in general because of a decline in

1872
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,880
well-paid well remunerated stable

1873
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,199
manufacturing jobs there's a kind of a

1874
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:30,659
decrease of middle income groups and you

1875
01:33:30,659 --> 01:33:33,179
end up with an hour class okay so

1876
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:36,780
something like that okay

1877
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:39,300
um that when this kind of figure shows

1878
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,980
how that works

1879
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:44,699
it's a bit hard to decipher here but

1880
01:33:44,699 --> 01:33:47,340
there's the growth of M which is kind of

1881
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:51,420
uh managerial class so CEOs of

1882
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:54,000
international corporations link to that

1883
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,239
is p these are kind of the producer

1884
01:33:57,239 --> 01:33:58,800
services or the advanced business

1885
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,360
services that we've been talking about

1886
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,820
and then below that see these are all

1887
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:05,960
kinds of clarable tasks okay

1888
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:09,239
menu tasks and kind of taking care of

1889
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:11,159
administrations

1890
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:14,219
Etc in the current day and age these

1891
01:34:14,219 --> 01:34:15,900
activities are also kind of being

1892
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,000
globalized and offshores and of

1893
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,460
themselves the 1980s there these back

1894
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:23,580
office Works still took place in global

1895
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,840
cities okay

1896
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:28,739
so at the same time you see a growth you

1897
01:34:28,739 --> 01:34:30,780
could say an informal markets or

1898
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:34,139
informal parts of the economy

1899
01:34:34,139 --> 01:34:34,860
um

1900
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:38,760
and these are often also based on

1901
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,940
um on migrantly okay

1902
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:42,840
um

1903
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,060
for instance what we have here I mean

1904
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,520
all these kind of amenities that we were

1905
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,520
talking about hurricane

1906
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,139
letter activities is kind of supported

1907
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:55,280
by that uh there's in informal

1908
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,780
production facilities that are

1909
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:01,440
re-emerging in cities and then yeah

1910
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,480
consumption rules and other kinds of

1911
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,179
things that are also kind of emerging

1912
01:35:06,179 --> 01:35:09,060
there in connection to

1913
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,400
um the rise of this APS complex and

1914
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,040
Global Corporation so in general what

1915
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,620
you need to remember is you have an

1916
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:20,040
exodus of these high-wage manufacturing

1917
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,560
jobs that's what kind of is the main the

1918
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,199
restructuring and the kind of influx of

1919
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:27,600
workers

1920
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,659
um often from uh from a global scale of

1921
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:33,360
foreign migrant workers that quite often

1922
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,840
end up in uh in informal labor markets

1923
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:39,239
and note that I still have this one if

1924
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:41,040
you don't mind how

1925
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,800
big okay so a general restructure of

1926
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,260
this labor market and importantly and

1927
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:47,820
what sets

1928
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:50,280
um women Global cities apart from you

1929
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,260
could say the rest of the territory or

1930
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:54,659
small cities is that this labor market

1931
01:35:54,659 --> 01:35:56,699
becomes globalized

1932
01:35:56,699 --> 01:35:59,340
and it speaks because I have both sides

1933
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:02,580
of uh this hourglass it works at the at

1934
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:05,400
the top level we have the uh the high

1935
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,540
paid

1936
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,659
um migrants and it works also at the

1937
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:12,420
lower end of the income distribution

1938
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:15,300
and quite interestingly

1939
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:18,659
uh sometimes quite cynically there's

1940
01:36:18,659 --> 01:36:20,520
um also different terminologies for that

1941
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:23,400
so people at the high end uh it doesn't

1942
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:26,040
really matter uh or they're kind of not

1943
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,620
seen as immigrants but these are expats

1944
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:31,139
quite often for instance in Belgium they

1945
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:33,840
enjoy quite interesting text regimes

1946
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,600
with the discussion as to whether it

1947
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,300
would be a nice idea to actually tax

1948
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:41,100
expats in Belgium

1949
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,560
um so these are kind of seen as people

1950
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,179
that

1951
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:45,900
um

1952
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,060
that bring in a lot of expertise a lot

1953
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,820
of value that make a city very

1954
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:54,360
competitive uh in this global war for

1955
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:58,020
talent whereas uh people that are more

1956
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:01,920
at in the lower paid jobs are seen as as

1957
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,760
immigrants right uh or foreigners etc

1958
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,320
etc Okay so

1959
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,060
there's a lot of terms of being used

1960
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:10,380
there that are

1961
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,920
take part of a very performative and

1962
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,560
normalizing

1963
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,600
um and normalizing the situation so the

1964
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,719
way we talk about these divisions

1965
01:37:21,719 --> 01:37:24,060
matters I think

1966
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:24,659
um

1967
01:37:24,659 --> 01:37:26,520
so what we see is

1968
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,159
um uh also

1969
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:32,360
growth of of low-skilled

1970
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:37,380
or these skilled uh migrant workers

1971
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:40,560
um so are the people that have little

1972
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,800
qualification in a country of origin and

1973
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:47,159
and come to a world of global City

1974
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:49,920
or people that have qualifications

1975
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,300
but

1976
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,639
for some reason because they cross the

1977
01:37:53,639 --> 01:37:57,239
border have lost proof of that okay so a

1978
01:37:57,239 --> 01:37:59,239
lot of contacts even if you eradicated

1979
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:02,760
in one or one in the other direction

1980
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,340
uh you have to kind of be accredited for

1981
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,739
that right so you have to uh your

1982
01:38:07,739 --> 01:38:10,139
diploma needs to be certified to be able

1983
01:38:10,139 --> 01:38:12,239
to access the labor market in one way or

1984
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:13,980
another

1985
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,900
this in and of itself is quite an

1986
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:18,600
interesting process uh but it means that

1987
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,820
a lot of people especially in informal

1988
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:24,060
uh relative informal migration

1989
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,560
may not be in the position to actually

1990
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,659
do that so they may have all kinds of

1991
01:38:27,659 --> 01:38:29,880
skills but they can't formally use them

1992
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,639
okay so this is a kind of process of

1993
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:34,860
descaling that is that is going on now

1994
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,600
what it creates especially in a place

1995
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,480
where you have a lot of immigration and

1996
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,340
that's that's typically World in global

1997
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:44,639
cities it just creates a very large pool

1998
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:48,719
of people that have a very poor

1999
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:49,440
um

2000
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,540
uh you could say that are that are not

2001
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:54,300
really empowered that that don't have a

2002
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:56,159
bargain power to negotiate a better

2003
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,900
wages

2004
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:00,600
um and if they don't do it well somebody

2005
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,219
else will and that's kind of the the

2006
01:39:02,219 --> 01:39:04,920
notion of a reserve Army of Labor

2007
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,920
a lot of people that are in flux debt

2008
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,100
will basically take any job

2009
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:13,080
and you see in that case you see the

2010
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,139
emergence of what people call 3D jobs

2011
01:39:16,139 --> 01:39:19,080
dirty demanding and dangerous or dirty

2012
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,780
dangerous and difficult uh a lot of

2013
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:24,000
Migrant labor in Roman Global cities

2014
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,159
ends up in uh these kind of segments

2015
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:32,580
and these are typically jobs that people

2016
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:35,820
um that kind of the natives if you will

2017
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:39,060
are unwilling to do

2018
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:41,400
and I mean for instance if you look at

2019
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,400
the whole debate about the fella Fallout

2020
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,139
of brexit

2021
01:39:46,139 --> 01:39:49,880
and it had been driven tremendously by

2022
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,739
anti-immigrant they are stealing our

2023
01:39:52,739 --> 01:39:56,340
jobs sentiment uh and now they're the

2024
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,800
economy is kind of crippled

2025
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,100
by uh not having access to fuel because

2026
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:05,159
there's no truck drivers to actually uh

2027
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:07,380
or migrant truck drives to actually

2028
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:10,080
bring the fuel to to pump stations gas

2029
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,080
stations so you can refill your car so

2030
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,219
it's kind of

2031
01:40:14,219 --> 01:40:18,659
uh history with the Vengeance there

2032
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:20,520
um and it kind of shows The crucial

2033
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,920
dependence of our economy a lot of

2034
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:23,940
cities

2035
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:26,520
in that migrant labor and a lot of

2036
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,000
essential services that is absolutely

2037
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,420
undervalued in societal terms

2038
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:34,860
um

2039
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,840
yeah and then

2040
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,360
what what is actually uh quite

2041
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,400
interesting to see and that's also work

2042
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,739
by Sasuke assassin when she was still

2043
01:40:43,739 --> 01:40:46,920
married hence group

2044
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:49,739
um that yeah

2045
01:40:49,739 --> 01:40:52,020
a lot of these activities are informal

2046
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,659
are connected to floating populations

2047
01:40:54,659 --> 01:40:58,739
people that are residing temporarily in

2048
01:40:58,739 --> 01:41:00,000
cities

2049
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,300
um that may be transmigrants uh move on

2050
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:05,179
one way or another

2051
01:41:05,179 --> 01:41:10,020
and yeah they they form the context of

2052
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,179
you could say potential exploitation

2053
01:41:12,179 --> 01:41:13,920
it's not necessarily happening but it's

2054
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,500
kind of a context where people that want

2055
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,900
to take advantage

2056
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:22,020
um Can more easily do that okay

2057
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:24,199
um it can be

2058
01:41:24,199 --> 01:41:26,520
sometimes for very good reasons to say

2059
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,940
Okay I want to help somebody

2060
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:33,300
and I'll let you clean my house or take

2061
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,580
care of the children and I'll pay you

2062
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,620
the minimum wage or something like that

2063
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:38,940
[Music]

2064
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:41,600
right that could be the position of a

2065
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,820
middle-class family uh in in a global

2066
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:46,920
City but at the same time there's this

2067
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:49,619
structural discrimination of these

2068
01:41:49,619 --> 01:41:52,260
groups in society they may be well

2069
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:55,380
suited to take other jobs at Society but

2070
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:57,719
yeah they're kind of forced into them so

2071
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:00,239
it's kind of in combination with a large

2072
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,980
group of people that are looking for

2073
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:03,719
jobs

2074
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:06,239
um the informal character allows a lot

2075
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:07,199
of

2076
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:10,860
um informal uh potential forms of of

2077
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:12,780
exploitation and this is what substance

2078
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:15,659
calls the peripheralization at the core

2079
01:42:15,659 --> 01:42:18,060
so what she says is that typically we

2080
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,100
think about exploitation as a relation

2081
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,800
between say the global North or the

2082
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,780
global South well actually it's taking

2083
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:27,780
place it re-enters the global North so

2084
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:30,179
in world and Global cities you can also

2085
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:32,280
find this

2086
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:35,880
um these exploitative relations because

2087
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:38,239
the global South is actually

2088
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:39,860
living

2089
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:43,560
in world and Global cities whereas the

2090
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:44,780
relation

2091
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:47,659
remains exported okay so

2092
01:42:47,659 --> 01:42:49,920
peripheralization of the Court just in

2093
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:53,040
figures to to illustrate this is to

2094
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,900
referred a little bit to the research on

2095
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:57,659
this so there's a whole strand of

2096
01:42:57,659 --> 01:43:00,060
research looking into urban belief

2097
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:02,280
Networks

2098
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:04,500
some kind of interesting work by uh

2099
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,659
William Carroll looking at Interlocking

2100
01:43:06,659 --> 01:43:09,840
directorates it's it's one way of

2101
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,460
measuring

2102
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:13,320
um you could say the connections between

2103
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,360
cities

2104
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:15,900
um

2105
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:19,560
by looking at the the overlaps between

2106
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:23,900
the board of directors of Corporation so

2107
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:28,739
one one member of the board sitting on

2108
01:43:28,739 --> 01:43:31,380
different boards so for instance

2109
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:36,480
uh 40 spunk Belgium and BNB buddy bar uh

2110
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:39,300
Paris or something like that and we see

2111
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,219
actually in this picture there's quite a

2112
01:43:41,219 --> 01:43:43,560
strong connection between Brussels and

2113
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,360
Paris but it shows that

2114
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:48,239
yeah uh as we we live in a kind of

2115
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:51,480
global economy as for the corporate

2116
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:54,179
world has globalized there's also you

2117
01:43:54,179 --> 01:43:55,800
could say the social structure there

2118
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:58,860
behind that of a traveling Global Elite

2119
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:00,960
with a lot of power decision making

2120
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,540
power that is connecting this kind of

2121
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:06,000
place okay so if you're board of

2122
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,400
directors of uh and the board of

2123
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,340
directors of 10 or 15 corporations well

2124
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:12,960
you will be

2125
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,460
you say traveling around in first class

2126
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:19,500
uh between these places

2127
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:23,280
uh and and go from Citadel to Citadel if

2128
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,080
you will okay

2129
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:26,639
um I also did a little bit of research

2130
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:29,699
into how this looks and Islamic markets

2131
01:44:29,699 --> 01:44:31,080
and I found actually quite similar

2132
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:34,020
things the geographies look different

2133
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:37,800
um but um what out of that is how

2134
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,739
governance structures work in Islamic

2135
01:44:40,739 --> 01:44:43,560
Banks and there you find that next to

2136
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,719
the typical board of directors you also

2137
01:44:45,719 --> 01:44:48,000
have a Sharia board and these these

2138
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,179
boards basically review to what extent

2139
01:44:51,179 --> 01:44:53,820
the activities of banks are

2140
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:57,840
in line with the Sharia okay so are they

2141
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,139
um hello or are they not considered uh

2142
01:45:01,139 --> 01:45:03,619
Allah

2143
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:06,600
uh yeah it's it's very similar to what I

2144
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,300
found in uh on the previous figure in

2145
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,739
the sense that it's also very

2146
01:45:10,739 --> 01:45:14,100
concentrated uh uh social geography so

2147
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,080
it's very concentrated in a very limited

2148
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:19,199
set of Scholars

2149
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:21,360
um some of them sit on the board 50

2150
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:24,420
different corporations

2151
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:26,100
um which creates all kinds of

2152
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:28,500
interesting things as to to what extent

2153
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:31,260
is this so credible that they will

2154
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:34,080
review uh the Sharia compliant character

2155
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,000
or other things going on

2156
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,219
uh you see there's a connection with New

2157
01:45:38,219 --> 01:45:39,840
York

2158
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,020
um well at some point golden Sachs uh

2159
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:46,199
also was planning to to go into Islamic

2160
01:45:46,199 --> 01:45:47,340
markets and there was a whole

2161
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:51,179
controversy uh as to what extents

2162
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:53,580
um their financial products

2163
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,739
was actually

2164
01:45:55,739 --> 01:45:59,340
um reviewed by by Sharia scholas or

2165
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:01,020
whether this was some kind of reviews

2166
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:04,920
etc etc there was a huge Flashback by

2167
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,800
um

2168
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,860
scores by this entire community and uh

2169
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:12,719
in the end it didn't materialize but

2170
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:15,000
just to show you that there's different

2171
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,739
ways of approaching these Urban lead

2172
01:46:16,739 --> 01:46:19,619
networks but it's it's the existence of

2173
01:46:19,619 --> 01:46:21,420
those kind of structures that allows us

2174
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:23,639
to understand yeah what kind of

2175
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:26,580
activities take place at that level and

2176
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,219
how do you can affect uh say income

2177
01:46:29,219 --> 01:46:30,360
structures because they they're

2178
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:33,199
extremely well remunerated and will

2179
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:36,900
reside in different kind of places

2180
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,119
now at the other end what I was talking

2181
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:41,159
about is this these new forms of

2182
01:46:41,159 --> 01:46:43,080
industrial

2183
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:43,820
um

2184
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:48,659
exploitation uh in these sweatshops

2185
01:46:48,659 --> 01:46:49,500
um

2186
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,179
so yeah what are these kind of

2187
01:46:51,179 --> 01:46:52,679
sweatshops you may have heard of that

2188
01:46:52,679 --> 01:46:55,199
it's kind of the Renaissance of very old

2189
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:58,320
forms of exploitation or industrial

2190
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,960
organization you may have heard about in

2191
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,239
the middle age Middle Ages you had to

2192
01:47:03,239 --> 01:47:05,699
put it out system where people in the

2193
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:07,500
household and were in the countryside

2194
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:11,219
were actually producing uh at the piece

2195
01:47:11,219 --> 01:47:16,080
by piece salary uh textiles for uh for

2196
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,480
capitalists and cities

2197
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:21,300
um it's kind of reinvented in the 20th

2198
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,060
and 21st century and so flat shops are

2199
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:27,540
these small units usually underground uh

2200
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:30,119
or in secluded spaces often in the

2201
01:47:30,119 --> 01:47:31,980
textile industry

2202
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:34,139
uh that works through all these kind of

2203
01:47:34,139 --> 01:47:37,320
sub subcontracting uh deals so you never

2204
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:40,139
quite know who is really hiring people

2205
01:47:40,139 --> 01:47:42,840
so there's different kind of layers of

2206
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:45,480
of governance there uh a lot of people

2207
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:48,840
yeah are indeed paid by the piece or

2208
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:52,800
have daily or weekly contracts uh which

2209
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,440
yeah it's extremely precarious as you

2210
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,659
may understand

2211
01:47:57,659 --> 01:48:00,239
um and yeah we see that it's kind of

2212
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:03,420
re-emerging and it was say the 19th

2213
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:04,380
century

2214
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:07,040
um it took place in a lot of

2215
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,119
industrializing cities

2216
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:12,420
it's went away and for instance in the

2217
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:16,260
U.S you see that because there was all

2218
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:19,020
kind of yeah the trade unions

2219
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:20,820
um initiatives

2220
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:24,840
uh regulations were adapted for instance

2221
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,600
in relation to the to the New Deal

2222
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,800
um just before uh the Second World War

2223
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:34,080
which made this practically impossible

2224
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:37,320
so it was in a context where you had far

2225
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:39,659
less migrant labor but actually possible

2226
01:48:39,659 --> 01:48:42,300
to regulate those markets

2227
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:45,420
but that's kind of returned to the 1990s

2228
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:48,719
this kind of all of a sudden is back at

2229
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:51,360
these are very old data but in the 1990s

2230
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,060
uh calculated I think between four

2231
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:55,860
thousand five hundred and four thousand

2232
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:58,080
five hundred of seven thousand textile

2233
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,239
companies there and then in New York

2234
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:03,300
were actually sweatshops okay so when

2235
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:04,920
you think about world city formation

2236
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,560
it's not just

2237
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,080
um these Glitz and Glam offices with

2238
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:13,020
bankers at the same time it's very old

2239
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:15,000
forms of exploitation that are made

2240
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,960
possible by a complete

2241
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:21,719
absence of any labor rights uh

2242
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:23,639
protection

2243
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:27,600
so yeah uh the places in Chinatown of

2244
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,840
the lower lower east and yeah is this

2245
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:33,840
kind of situations are still occurring

2246
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,320
there okay

2247
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:40,020
now then to turn a little bit to

2248
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:42,900
um I would say criticism or critiques of

2249
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,420
the polarization pieces because it seems

2250
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:47,880
to be a very kind of elegant thesis

2251
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:50,219
right as the the restructuring of the

2252
01:49:50,219 --> 01:49:52,560
economy at the same time there's a

2253
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,080
globalization it leads to attraction of

2254
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,960
headquarters and APS functions and this

2255
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:00,360
kind of adds to a wider process of

2256
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,940
income and rational polarization which

2257
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:05,040
then may also lead to social spatial

2258
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,900
polarization okay because people with

2259
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,940
different kind of income groups may not

2260
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:11,460
necessarily live in the same place quite

2261
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:13,260
on the contrary if they have very

2262
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:14,760
different Lifestyles they may want to

2263
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:16,800
live something else

2264
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,139
same time also the empirical base is

2265
01:50:19,139 --> 01:50:22,739
mostly linked to a limited set of of

2266
01:50:22,739 --> 01:50:25,980
cases New York London Tokyo so

2267
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:28,500
especially in the 1990s when

2268
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:31,260
this became a major debate the question

2269
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:36,060
is is Susan right uh or is something

2270
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:38,520
wrong to put it in the words of Chris

2271
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:41,400
Hamlet who is also one of one of you say

2272
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,800
the main counter voices in this debate

2273
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:46,080
so for instance according to to hamnet

2274
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,239
yeah he's very critical of this term

2275
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:50,760
polarization as we also briefly

2276
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:52,199
discussed before

2277
01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:54,480
he says well it's an all-purpose General

2278
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,360
signifier

2279
01:50:56,360 --> 01:51:00,179
and in the end yeah it doesn't really

2280
01:51:00,179 --> 01:51:02,719
explain much and we don't

2281
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,920
necessarily neatly describe what is

2282
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,440
going on in particular world cities

2283
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:10,139
so what it says is that next to

2284
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:11,880
polarization

2285
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,520
this other process is thinking thinkable

2286
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,280
right we can think about

2287
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:18,960
proletarianization so that's the

2288
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,900
emergence of say

2289
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:24,540
an exploited underclass if you will to

2290
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:27,420
use that term in society as the main

2291
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:28,619
Trend or it could also be

2292
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:31,080
professionalization which somehow refers

2293
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:34,139
to social Mobility

2294
01:51:34,139 --> 01:51:37,080
um the rise of middle income jobs etc

2295
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:39,900
etc so instead of assuming that world

2296
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,360
and Global City formation necessarily

2297
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:45,600
produces polarization it's actually a

2298
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,219
research question empirical question

2299
01:51:47,219 --> 01:51:51,540
what is going on uh in cities Okay so

2300
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:54,840
rather than just saying okay uh this is

2301
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:59,040
a piece or or a given fact it may be a

2302
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:02,100
hypothesis to see to what extent we see

2303
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,619
evidence of polarization or where do we

2304
01:52:04,619 --> 01:52:06,480
see other things happening and one way

2305
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,820
of doing that is also taking more into

2306
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:11,760
account the occupational structure and

2307
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,060
the spatial structure of cities

2308
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:17,580
so to tell a bit more about this

2309
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:21,000
occupational structure uh what it talks

2310
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,100
about Chris hamnet and this is kind of

2311
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:27,060
an interesting evolution in the 1990s uh

2312
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:30,179
he mostly looked at the case of London

2313
01:52:30,179 --> 01:52:33,300
uh and he says well

2314
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:35,639
what we find in New York

2315
01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:37,980
are not necessarily necessarily find

2316
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:40,500
that in the case of London there's

2317
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,020
actually very little polarization what I

2318
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:45,900
find is professionalization okay

2319
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:48,719
so yes there's a growth of high income

2320
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:49,860
jobs

2321
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:52,980
but it's not necessarily linked to an

2322
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:56,400
explosion of jobs at the bottom so it's

2323
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:59,159
it's not really an hourglass at the same

2324
01:52:59,159 --> 01:53:02,100
time we also see evidence of a growth in

2325
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:04,280
Middle income jobs

2326
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,920
and a lot of people

2327
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:10,920
can make can move up you could say the

2328
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:14,880
occupational structure can be trained uh

2329
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,060
it can get a training

2330
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:22,080
um and are professionalizing

2331
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,960
um so yeah he doesn't find the pattern

2332
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,920
of of what what was assumed to be the

2333
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:32,460
the two expected pattern of New York at

2334
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:33,900
the same time he says well it could be

2335
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:38,460
related to the fact that migration is

2336
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:41,400
there and then far less the case

2337
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:45,480
um it's also uncomparable to uh what you

2338
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,239
find in New York so you had migration

2339
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:51,659
obviously uh to London but it was less

2340
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:54,239
globalized it was mostly linked you

2341
01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:55,679
could say too

2342
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:59,699
the remnants of Empire but it wasn't of

2343
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:02,580
the scale of what you found in New York

2344
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:05,159
and so he says yeah there's also a much

2345
01:54:05,159 --> 01:54:08,000
more generous welfare state

2346
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,159
when you compare it to what you had in

2347
01:54:11,159 --> 01:54:12,420
New York so

2348
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:15,300
no this is okay let's not exaggerate we

2349
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,280
don't really fight polarization other

2350
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:21,600
pathways are actually thinkable

2351
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,060
um and then

2352
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:27,840
what we actually uh kind of find them in

2353
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,460
such context is that

2354
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:30,179
um

2355
01:54:30,179 --> 01:54:32,400
it might be something that's kind of

2356
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,619
more intersects with

2357
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:35,460
um

2358
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:39,480
you could say uh process of privilege

2359
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:43,500
that intersects with gender roles in uh

2360
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,780
and society and this benefit so it's

2361
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:49,199
it's less uh the whole discussion about

2362
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:52,199
yes does this APS complex that that

2363
01:54:52,199 --> 01:54:54,060
start to transform the entire labor

2364
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:56,520
market now it's actually wider

2365
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:00,540
dimensions of of uh gender and ethnicity

2366
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:03,000
which is in society that will explain

2367
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,639
what we find in labor markets so for

2368
01:55:05,639 --> 01:55:08,400
instance Joy by Susan uh Feinstein

2369
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:12,000
and colleagues they they look at uh the

2370
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,139
exclusion uh by female labor in high-end

2371
01:55:16,139 --> 01:55:19,980
jobs or for instance the work by uh by

2372
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:21,420
John Wills

2373
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:23,580
um no John May and colleagues I forgot

2374
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:27,800
what the first name of the co-water is

2375
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:32,040
is to say okay look we have to look much

2376
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,139
more at ethnicity to understand what is

2377
01:55:34,139 --> 01:55:36,119
going on because

2378
01:55:36,119 --> 01:55:38,820
um for instance one third of of London's

2379
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:41,820
Filipino population is actually in

2380
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:44,219
Health and Social care Brazilians are in

2381
01:55:44,219 --> 01:55:46,980
cleaning services uh

2382
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:53,119
sick are are hired as as security guards

2383
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:55,980
algerians are running

2384
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:59,400
um the Metro System etc etc okay so

2385
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:01,440
these kind of more General processes

2386
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:04,020
will tell us much more about what is

2387
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:06,119
going on

2388
01:56:06,119 --> 01:56:08,040
what we find is that when you start

2389
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,980
looking at more recent work at London

2390
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:14,820
is that yeah this whole argument that

2391
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:16,920
that longness somehow excluded or

2392
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:20,719
protected from processes of polarization

2393
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:24,179
doesn't really seem to hold yeah there's

2394
01:56:24,179 --> 01:56:25,380
a question

2395
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:28,380
uh

2396
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:43,260
yeah like a shadow economy or something

2397
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:46,260
yeah I think that's one of the reasons

2398
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:49,100
uh that's a very good point and I think

2399
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:51,360
that's one of the differences between

2400
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,940
for instance the work of John May and

2401
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:58,020
colleagues and the conclusions by Chris

2402
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:01,020
Hamner who is focusing on formal

2403
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:02,940
occupational structures

2404
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:05,340
so indeed that's the first point

2405
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:07,860
methodological question is there's

2406
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:09,900
basically a result of the data that is

2407
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:11,119
being used

2408
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:15,000
and actually what you find is that uh in

2409
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,980
the article that was in the reader which

2410
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:20,580
is a way more recent one he also admits

2411
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:23,099
that process of polarization are going

2412
01:57:23,099 --> 01:57:27,840
on in London okay so it's kind of um he

2413
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:31,500
has seen the light Chris Hamlet and

2414
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:33,119
that's kind of yeah just referring to

2415
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:35,580
this paper is kind of I find a very

2416
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:36,780
interesting paper because it really

2417
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:40,440
targets uh migrant groups here in the

2418
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:43,380
sense that they look at at remuneration

2419
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:46,699
and the kind of jobs that are being done

2420
01:57:46,699 --> 01:57:49,440
by people that typically are not part of

2421
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,659
visual statistics

2422
01:57:51,659 --> 01:57:52,380
um

2423
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:56,040
and yeah it's kind of it's kind of hard

2424
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,659
to draw conclusions from that and say

2425
01:57:57,659 --> 01:57:59,880
okay uh for instance if you look at this

2426
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:02,400
picture yeah this kind of showing the

2427
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,340
the division across different kind of uh

2428
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:10,560
rage groups so they they yeah collected

2429
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:14,159
responses by over 300

2430
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:19,800
uh uh people in informal markets

2431
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:20,760
um

2432
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,940
yeah you find that only nine percent

2433
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:26,940
actually uh earns the living wage right

2434
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:28,679
so it's it's

2435
01:58:28,679 --> 01:58:31,560
it really shows that there's an overlay

2436
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:35,340
between the migrant labor and poor

2437
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,380
working conditions but at the same time

2438
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:40,320
it doesn't give you an overview of the

2439
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,000
entire structure of the labor market so

2440
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,219
it's kind of a yeah it can't draw

2441
01:58:44,219 --> 01:58:46,139
systemic conclusions from that but if

2442
01:58:46,139 --> 01:58:47,820
you for instance compare it to this kind

2443
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:50,820
of picture which is not about income but

2444
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:52,199
there's about

2445
01:58:52,199 --> 01:58:55,199
uh job quality so it's a very rough

2446
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:59,460
marker of you could say yeah where in

2447
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:01,860
the say social hierarchy or occupational

2448
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:03,780
hierarchy are we at

2449
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:05,760
there you see that there's actually a

2450
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:08,520
growth at uh in the kind of the the

2451
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:11,219
shooting jobs if you will

2452
01:59:11,219 --> 01:59:15,000
um a stagnation will be prime of normal

2453
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,300
decent jobs and a large growth at the at

2454
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:20,880
the top okay so and these kind of

2455
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,500
indicators that that they would

2456
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,719
occupational structure it's counter

2457
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:27,960
evidence towards professionalization so

2458
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:30,980
I think what happens here is that

2459
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:34,440
when Chris Hammond was writing his his

2460
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:37,860
argument against Susan in the 1990s it

2461
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:39,840
may have still been true

2462
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,619
it may be have been biased by looking at

2463
01:59:43,619 --> 01:59:47,580
formal statistics not capturing what was

2464
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:50,099
going on at the bottom because it was

2465
01:59:50,099 --> 01:59:51,840
basically part of the informal economy

2466
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,900
but then even with that

2467
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:58,320
as time has passed the picture uh even

2468
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,060
in the formal Market would would no

2469
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:01,739
longer look as he would have described

2470
02:00:01,739 --> 02:00:04,440
it so it's kind of a process of of

2471
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:06,960
restructuring that has um that has only

2472
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,420
been initiated later I think compared to

2473
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:11,840
to report

2474
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:15,360
okay but in any case I think

2475
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,340
um it's also not necessarily the points

2476
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:22,500
uh to say okay assassin is right or uh

2477
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:25,139
or Hamlet is wrong point is that we have

2478
02:00:25,139 --> 02:00:26,280
to

2479
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:29,099
identify different process that can

2480
02:00:29,099 --> 02:00:30,840
actually take place at the same time so

2481
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:33,659
you can imagine ant polarization and

2482
02:00:33,659 --> 02:00:35,400
professionalization at the same time

2483
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:38,280
it's not because you see polarization

2484
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:40,199
that some

2485
02:00:40,199 --> 02:00:41,940
segments of the population actually

2486
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:45,239
undergo social Mobility uh in fact it

2487
02:00:45,239 --> 02:00:46,500
could actually be quite an interesting

2488
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:48,480
question in the context of

2489
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,699
polarization who is still able to

2490
02:00:50,699 --> 02:00:53,219
improve oneself on the labor market and

2491
02:00:53,219 --> 02:00:55,800
who is who is not so it's kind I think

2492
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:57,659
that for me was kind of the gist of of

2493
02:00:57,659 --> 02:01:00,960
the article uh by Chris Hamlet's uh

2494
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,340
there

2495
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:04,679
okay let me move on because uh again

2496
02:01:04,679 --> 02:01:07,380
running out of time

2497
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:09,599
um so yeah looking more closely at the

2498
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:11,659
occupational structure I I can't

2499
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,239
possibly go beyond that but it gives you

2500
02:01:15,239 --> 02:01:17,520
a hint of what to look for the second

2501
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:21,000
element is spatial structure right so a

2502
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,920
very important critique Prince by Susan

2503
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:28,320
Feinstein is uh to what extent are the

2504
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,659
result of polarization is also a

2505
02:01:30,659 --> 02:01:32,880
statistical artifact and there's a lot

2506
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,900
of focus on on cities

2507
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:39,900
but we at the same time we know that

2508
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:41,940
middle classes have been suburbanizing

2509
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:45,300
or are still suburbanizing so maybe this

2510
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:48,840
whole disappearance of middle-income

2511
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:50,940
jobs from cities and the fact that you

2512
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:52,500
end up with a very polarized labor

2513
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:54,480
market it could be some kind of an

2514
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,639
artifact

2515
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:58,920
um so yeah I think that's something to

2516
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:01,320
to take into account that's also why

2517
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:03,300
it's interesting to compare you could

2518
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:06,599
say differences between what we did in

2519
02:02:06,599 --> 02:02:09,360
New York State versus New York City I

2520
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,699
think you can't say that there's no

2521
02:02:11,699 --> 02:02:14,460
General Trend in kind of a decline of

2522
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:16,500
middle income jobs for instance in the

2523
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:19,440
case of of the US

2524
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,420
um but it's perhaps less accentuated

2525
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:24,239
than if you only look at at a very neat

2526
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:26,940
uh City Center okay so there's always an

2527
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:28,920
a possibility that wealth is

2528
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:30,840
suburbanized and would give you a

2529
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:32,159
different question so

2530
02:02:32,159 --> 02:02:34,980
scale matters space matters in the sense

2531
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:37,380
that you have to be aware that you need

2532
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:40,040
to kind of map the appropriate

2533
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:43,440
metropolitan area to to understand the

2534
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,000
entire structure of the labor market

2535
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,380
okay

2536
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:49,440
no yeah and everything can go many ways

2537
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:50,639
and sense that you also have to be

2538
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:52,739
sensitive to what extents

2539
02:02:52,739 --> 02:02:53,580
um

2540
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:56,159
uh you could say these higher incomes

2541
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:58,139
will drive gentrification there has been

2542
02:02:58,139 --> 02:03:01,280
a whole process of moving out of cities

2543
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:04,020
uh but there's also been a return to the

2544
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,780
city when you take a city like Brussels

2545
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:09,360
I think I would say it's around a few

2546
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:11,040
thousand there has been a return of

2547
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:13,340
middle incomes and a lot of places

2548
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:16,139
really leading world cities has been

2549
02:03:16,139 --> 02:03:18,119
returned of the super rich

2550
02:03:18,119 --> 02:03:21,360
uh setting in motion motion process of

2551
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,280
what Loretta Lee Schools super

2552
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:26,040
gentrification in just one example of

2553
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:28,260
that is and I refer to that on the map

2554
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:30,000
uh Brooklyn

2555
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,780
used to be you could say uh a nice uh

2556
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:38,219
suburb uh off of New York just across uh

2557
02:03:38,219 --> 02:03:41,280
the river which was still affordable and

2558
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,199
you could deliver these Brown stones but

2559
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:44,960
what she described is

2560
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:51,239
how actually the the top uh earners in

2561
02:03:51,239 --> 02:03:53,280
New York are increasing we're

2562
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,860
increasingly buying in uh in these

2563
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:57,900
property markets so we see that almost

2564
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,820
half of

2565
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:02,820
um of all Brooklyn was owned by the top

2566
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:06,360
10 okay and that in that period you see

2567
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:09,179
a tremendous growth in or inflation of

2568
02:04:09,179 --> 02:04:12,300
property values in that period so you

2569
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,219
really have to look at the detailed

2570
02:04:14,219 --> 02:04:17,760
level uh within a city how uh you can

2571
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,920
say these higher incomes

2572
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:22,199
yeah what kind of spatial process they

2573
02:04:22,199 --> 02:04:25,080
set in motion and sometimes at least a

2574
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:26,219
gentrification of inner city

2575
02:04:26,219 --> 02:04:28,260
neighborhoods it may be more peripheral

2576
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:31,739
processes etc etc so there's no Unified

2577
02:04:31,739 --> 02:04:34,800
spatial structure there it's just a

2578
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,139
question if we have a restructure of the

2579
02:04:37,139 --> 02:04:38,460
economy

2580
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:40,980
where does it spatially attaches itself

2581
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,239
okay

2582
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:45,260
another example is for instance Brussels

2583
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:49,380
where we find that let's say voltage

2584
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:52,159
information and process often

2585
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:54,659
europeanization of the economy and all

2586
02:04:54,659 --> 02:04:56,159
kind of functions that are linked to

2587
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:58,800
that how it has kind of reinforced

2588
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,679
existing social spatial divides and this

2589
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:04,739
is worked by uh now admitted to a

2590
02:05:04,739 --> 02:05:07,440
professor from KU live and discussed a

2591
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,400
lot

2592
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:11,159
uh who looked at

2593
02:05:11,159 --> 02:05:14,099
um at the evolution of you could say

2594
02:05:14,099 --> 02:05:17,099
migrants populations and expat

2595
02:05:17,099 --> 02:05:19,260
populations sorry for that divide again

2596
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:23,639
but it's it's being used in reality

2597
02:05:23,639 --> 02:05:25,860
um in in Brussels and what you see is

2598
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:26,820
that

2599
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:27,659
um

2600
02:05:27,659 --> 02:05:29,159
uh you could say typically the

2601
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:32,520
population with with a lower income

2602
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:35,820
um the Moroccan population has has grown

2603
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:38,719
in the western partner western part of

2604
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:41,840
the city

2605
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:48,540
and the poor Crescent which is kind of

2606
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:50,460
the leading imaginary there also with

2607
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:53,540
policy makers uh whereas you could say

2608
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:56,840
europeanization has attracted a lot of

2609
02:05:56,840 --> 02:06:00,420
expats uh mostly Americans and other

2610
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:02,719
kind of um

2611
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:05,880
people from the European Union mostly

2612
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:09,000
settled in the Southeastern part of

2613
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,540
um of Brussels and what Chris castellope

2614
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:16,020
explains is that in this geography it's

2615
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:18,719
kind of reproducing earlier rounds of

2616
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:22,080
division in Brussels

2617
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:25,199
um it's kind of no coincidence that

2618
02:06:25,199 --> 02:06:28,139
people with a Moroccan uh ethnicity end

2619
02:06:28,139 --> 02:06:31,380
up in the Northwest it has something to

2620
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:33,780
do with the wider process of of Migrant

2621
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:37,139
labor guest Labor uh from the 1950s and

2622
02:06:37,139 --> 02:06:38,940
60s

2623
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:40,560
I can say a lot about that but the

2624
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,480
bottom line is Belgian government

2625
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:45,840
actually uh went to Morocco but also

2626
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:49,020
Turkey Greece Italy to

2627
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:50,699
um to really

2628
02:06:50,699 --> 02:06:53,460
you could say brand Belgium as the place

2629
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:55,020
to work

2630
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:57,420
um a lot of of Migrant Services broader

2631
02:06:57,420 --> 02:07:00,000
families they were seen as temporary

2632
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,460
guest workers and the empties people

2633
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:04,860
decided yes we were going to build a

2634
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:06,000
family here

2635
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,460
uh and he actually well uh worked in all

2636
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:10,260
kinds of productive activities in

2637
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:11,880
Brussels

2638
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:15,780
who with the crisis of the 1960s 70s

2639
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:18,360
uh ended so the the you could say

2640
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:20,520
globalization of production also had a

2641
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:24,119
huge impact on these kind of jobs so a

2642
02:07:24,119 --> 02:07:26,520
lot of these migrant workers

2643
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:28,500
were faced with structural unemployment

2644
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:30,900
and were kind of locked in into these

2645
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:34,800
situations uh and yeah never really got

2646
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,199
out of there okay so there's there's

2647
02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:38,280
still

2648
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:39,119
um

2649
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:42,659
uh provides unemployment rates

2650
02:07:42,659 --> 02:07:46,320
um and what we find is that with the

2651
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:49,260
restructuring of the economy just at the

2652
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:50,940
time when new kind of jobs were being

2653
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:53,159
created there were the jobs that were

2654
02:07:53,159 --> 02:07:56,280
not really matching the the profile of

2655
02:07:56,280 --> 02:07:57,780
these guest workers so there was a lot

2656
02:07:57,780 --> 02:08:00,659
of of service work

2657
02:08:00,659 --> 02:08:03,420
um and yeah I mean it required training

2658
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:06,599
which was not necessarily offered to

2659
02:08:06,599 --> 02:08:08,219
make that transition within one

2660
02:08:08,219 --> 02:08:09,840
generation so

2661
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:12,179
that's why you kind of see this this

2662
02:08:12,179 --> 02:08:15,840
kind of pattern uh reproduce so the

2663
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,580
argument by Chris gas float is that we

2664
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:19,860
should really uh look also into

2665
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:20,580
um

2666
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:23,520
looking at the continuities uh in these

2667
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:25,739
spatial structures you for instance also

2668
02:08:25,739 --> 02:08:27,119
find that

2669
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:30,300
um in in contemporary Elite geographies

2670
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:32,699
and kind of continuing a little bit the

2671
02:08:32,699 --> 02:08:34,679
work by Chris Castle but then focusing

2672
02:08:34,679 --> 02:08:38,159
on say the the upper stratum if you will

2673
02:08:38,159 --> 02:08:40,860
uh we looked at cultural patronage

2674
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:43,880
activities which is basically

2675
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:47,040
a method to identify people with a lot

2676
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:49,860
of money or that think about themselves

2677
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:52,800
as being distinct by consuming high-end

2678
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,719
cultural activity so we basically went

2679
02:08:54,719 --> 02:08:58,199
to uh La moner

2680
02:08:58,199 --> 02:09:00,199
um

2681
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:06,320
uh what is it again uh Elizabeth

2682
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:08,820
so you have all kinds of highbrow

2683
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:11,400
cultural activities uh in Brussels

2684
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:14,040
taking place we also went to Bazaar we

2685
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:16,380
tried to identify who is actually on the

2686
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:20,219
big friend list uh who is sponsoring

2687
02:09:20,219 --> 02:09:22,800
these uh high-end cultural institutions

2688
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:25,800
I mean these fees are not kind of super

2689
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:28,380
spectacular I think sometimes we find

2690
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:30,239
it's kind of you become a big fan of

2691
02:09:30,239 --> 02:09:33,420
bizarre I think it was 12 500 euros per

2692
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:36,719
year so it's not kind of Jeff Jeff Bezos

2693
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:38,159
but at the same time it's not something

2694
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:41,460
that you could spend on a normal salary

2695
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:44,880
so you that was kind of used as a as a

2696
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:47,280
kind of Criterion to kind of find a

2697
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:49,380
group that that has both you could say

2698
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:52,280
cultural capital uh and also economic

2699
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:54,659
what we found then is that and that was

2700
02:09:54,659 --> 02:09:56,219
actually quite interesting that the two

2701
02:09:56,219 --> 02:09:58,139
these kind of methods you could actually

2702
02:09:58,139 --> 02:10:01,320
identify where these people live and we

2703
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:04,080
actually I mean boss and I uh took our

2704
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:07,739
pipes and went taken pictures uh I could

2705
02:10:07,739 --> 02:10:11,400
actually uh at the plot level identify

2706
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:13,380
where where Elites were living

2707
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:15,060
do you find kind of interesting

2708
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:16,679
clusterings there

2709
02:10:16,679 --> 02:10:19,139
and it's all very much concentrated in

2710
02:10:19,139 --> 02:10:21,540
and actually in a city neighborhood so

2711
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:24,960
most of the kind of Roads led to uh to

2712
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:27,380
this kind of area around

2713
02:10:27,380 --> 02:10:31,679
and those kind of areas so we identified

2714
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:34,020
that our Elites are very Urban if you

2715
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:36,540
will and the other place was kind of

2716
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:40,440
more uh Suburban but still within the

2717
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:42,800
Russell's Capital Region with spookular

2718
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,739
which is more like villain neighborhood

2719
02:10:46,739 --> 02:10:47,639
um

2720
02:10:47,639 --> 02:10:50,340
uh so it's kind of a distinct uh way of

2721
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:52,320
life but it's kind of interesting that

2722
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,780
the the major we could say segregation

2723
02:10:54,780 --> 02:10:57,420
process that you find in terms of gated

2724
02:10:57,420 --> 02:11:00,179
communities those kind of things this is

2725
02:11:00,179 --> 02:11:02,159
not something that you

2726
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:04,199
easily find in Brussels these things

2727
02:11:04,199 --> 02:11:06,719
exist in Brussels but it's not

2728
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:10,860
yeah it's not the Sao Paulo or Rio de

2729
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:13,139
Janeiro or this kind of thing so it's

2730
02:11:13,139 --> 02:11:14,460
really

2731
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:17,520
um Happening by micro mechanisms at the

2732
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,980
Block Level that is kind of segregation

2733
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:22,760
is is going on

2734
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:25,980
no just those were just a few examples

2735
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:29,099
to take into account uh histories of

2736
02:11:29,099 --> 02:11:32,040
spatial structure that may matter

2737
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:34,980
now drawing into a close I think what I

2738
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:39,360
want to say is that yeah how to explain

2739
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:42,239
um we could say inequality polarization

2740
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:43,800
etc etc I think we've learned that

2741
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:45,960
polarization it's just one way of one

2742
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:49,440
outcome of this process is we need some

2743
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:51,480
kind of an analytical or explanatory

2744
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:52,920
model for that

2745
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:55,440
Hannah and I want to draw on birds and

2746
02:11:55,440 --> 02:11:58,020
mustard here and I find it's still quite

2747
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:59,520
interesting because they they're working

2748
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:01,739
kind of three ways they said look

2749
02:12:01,739 --> 02:12:04,260
there's at the macro level a level of

2750
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:06,900
global change the economy in general is

2751
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:08,880
restructuring it could be financializing

2752
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:11,580
this uh new international division of

2753
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:14,040
labor etc etc so that's happening at the

2754
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:15,659
macro level there's also at the

2755
02:12:15,659 --> 02:12:17,639
individual level

2756
02:12:17,639 --> 02:12:20,340
due to personal characteristics choices

2757
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:21,199
Etc

2758
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:24,659
patterns habits cultures you may uh have

2759
02:12:24,659 --> 02:12:25,739
different kind of Labor Market

2760
02:12:25,739 --> 02:12:27,900
opportunities

2761
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:30,179
um there's a lot of noise there it's

2762
02:12:30,179 --> 02:12:31,679
hard to study

2763
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:34,080
um in a systematic way but we need to

2764
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:36,000
acknowledge that but what is kind of

2765
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,860
interesting is how the micro and the

2766
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:40,080
micro kind of connected by this medium

2767
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:42,360
level level of analysis

2768
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:44,400
because it's kind of the interface

2769
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:46,679
between Global process and local process

2770
02:12:46,679 --> 02:12:49,500
so we can think about how ethnicity

2771
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:51,840
gender and those kind of things will

2772
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,840
structure access to the labor market and

2773
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:56,940
positionality in the labor market as

2774
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:58,920
that labor market is being restructured

2775
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:00,719
we have to acknowledge National

2776
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:02,880
differences

2777
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:04,800
um we talked about yeah the rise of

2778
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:06,659
neoliberalization

2779
02:13:06,659 --> 02:13:09,300
it hasn't materialized in the same way

2780
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,760
or at the same time in different kind of

2781
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:14,159
spaces there's large differences still

2782
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:16,079
between more you could say

2783
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:18,260
Social Democratic

2784
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:20,460
or at least

2785
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:24,420
light versions of social democracy

2786
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:27,179
um Princeton Continental Europe compared

2787
02:13:27,179 --> 02:13:30,020
to the UK or the US

2788
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:31,739
so

2789
02:13:31,739 --> 02:13:34,260
in Continental Europe in many places

2790
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:37,380
there's still quite a solid social

2791
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:41,280
security system uh minimum wages etc etc

2792
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:43,920
and we kind of identify these are kind

2793
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:48,440
of crucial elements in explaining uh

2794
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:51,780
oh my God promo federalization is

2795
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:54,239
getting late so if you have these kind

2796
02:13:54,239 --> 02:13:57,900
of security measures in place it will

2797
02:13:57,900 --> 02:13:59,880
immediately kind of prevent at least

2798
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:03,179
informal markets uh that you have a an

2799
02:14:03,179 --> 02:14:04,980
explosion at the bottom

2800
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:07,739
um so yeah that's that's something to

2801
02:14:07,739 --> 02:14:09,780
take into account and also clearly even

2802
02:14:09,780 --> 02:14:12,000
within National context you need to look

2803
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,099
at the functions and that's connecting

2804
02:14:14,099 --> 02:14:17,699
back today with Harvey uh cities have

2805
02:14:17,699 --> 02:14:19,079
different kind of functions and that

2806
02:14:19,079 --> 02:14:21,420
will also shape its trajectory if you

2807
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:23,159
look at city like Detroit or Charlotte

2808
02:14:23,159 --> 02:14:27,360
War it's not so likely that these places

2809
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,219
will now become leading Global

2810
02:14:29,219 --> 02:14:32,280
commandment control centers okay

2811
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:35,280
um because they don't simply don't have

2812
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:39,060
that uh that economic trajectory so

2813
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:41,159
that's something this positionality in

2814
02:14:41,159 --> 02:14:44,119
global economic systems has also been

2815
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:47,699
taken into account concluding then I

2816
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:50,340
think yeah the future how would it look

2817
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:51,900
like

2818
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:54,599
um this kind of freewheeling here but

2819
02:14:54,599 --> 02:14:57,000
it's it's kind of lightly and you can

2820
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,440
see in the you know kind of current

2821
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:01,800
developments uh in cities also amid

2822
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:04,440
covet is that it's very likely that

2823
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:07,139
these growing inequalities are only

2824
02:15:07,139 --> 02:15:09,300
going to increase

2825
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:12,739
according to me you see that austerity

2826
02:15:12,739 --> 02:15:17,460
has been temporarily kind of uh forced

2827
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:19,380
there's a lot of intervention linked to

2828
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:21,480
covet there's again a discourse of a

2829
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:22,980
strong state

2830
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:26,340
but as you saw that you immediately send

2831
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:28,440
a lot of official documents that it had

2832
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:31,079
to be temporary and now you see a return

2833
02:15:31,079 --> 02:15:33,540
to a kind of discourse that there will

2834
02:15:33,540 --> 02:15:35,639
be again budget cuts need to be made et

2835
02:15:35,639 --> 02:15:38,940
cetera etc for instance in Flanders we

2836
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:42,060
are preparing the digi from the digi

2837
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:44,099
jump so our education needs to go

2838
02:15:44,099 --> 02:15:45,239
digital

2839
02:15:45,239 --> 02:15:48,119
but at the same time we have to have a

2840
02:15:48,119 --> 02:15:50,579
budget cut of 100 million euro

2841
02:15:50,579 --> 02:15:52,260
so

2842
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:54,840
okay how do you marry those two I mean

2843
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:57,300
for sure there's ways to become more

2844
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:59,940
efficient but at the same time it's not

2845
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:01,619
really credible okay

2846
02:16:01,619 --> 02:16:05,520
uh so nothing really has changed I think

2847
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:08,820
in this micro narrative uh of austerity

2848
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:11,480
so that's that's kind of continuing

2849
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:14,639
and uh you could say the flexibilization

2850
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:17,760
of the labor market it's still also

2851
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:20,639
progressing okay

2852
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:22,560
uh it will be different in different

2853
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:25,739
kind of contexts but it's it's it's not

2854
02:16:25,739 --> 02:16:29,099
really going away uh migration as you

2855
02:16:29,099 --> 02:16:30,780
know

2856
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:33,000
um and this is linked obviously to to

2857
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,920
wider issues such as uh uh Global change

2858
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:40,859
will simply be more people that will

2859
02:16:40,859 --> 02:16:42,959
have to rely on migration to still make

2860
02:16:42,959 --> 02:16:44,040
a living

2861
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:47,160
uh which also means in a lot of cities

2862
02:16:47,160 --> 02:16:48,840
if you don't work on Social Security

2863
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:52,080
minimum wage etc etc you will don't you

2864
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:54,420
won't do anything about the uh the whole

2865
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:56,280
discussion about the reserve Army of

2866
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:58,260
Labor so these conditions for

2867
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:00,299
exploitation

2868
02:17:00,299 --> 02:17:02,879
will remain in place

2869
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:05,218
so that's kind of working at the at the

2870
02:17:05,218 --> 02:17:06,959
bottom end if you will

2871
02:17:06,959 --> 02:17:09,840
at the same time at the top end uh and

2872
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,280
it's kind of returning a little bit to

2873
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:12,540
the whole discussion about income

2874
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:14,580
distribution at the very start

2875
02:17:14,580 --> 02:17:16,679
we see that there's some kind of Return

2876
02:17:16,679 --> 02:17:19,679
of the Gilded Age has

2877
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:22,978
um Thomas picketti calls it so a period

2878
02:17:22,978 --> 02:17:25,740
in the in the 20th century where in the

2879
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:30,058
19th century sorry uh where a lot of

2880
02:17:30,058 --> 02:17:32,459
um you could say personal protectories

2881
02:17:32,459 --> 02:17:34,799
were kind of shape there where you where

2882
02:17:34,799 --> 02:17:36,898
you already come from so it's a form of

2883
02:17:36,898 --> 02:17:39,359
patrimonial capitalism where it matters

2884
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:43,500
more uh who your parents are than what

2885
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:46,500
you do in terms of uh I choose this

2886
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:48,240
profession or that profession I work

2887
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:50,820
with choose to work hard etc etc

2888
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:52,920
and that means that

2889
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:53,478
um

2890
02:17:53,478 --> 02:17:59,040
an increasing uh part of of of wealth

2891
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:03,478
is not based on on income but it's based

2892
02:18:03,478 --> 02:18:06,718
on other sources of return on assets so

2893
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:08,519
you see that a lot of

2894
02:18:08,519 --> 02:18:10,379
a lot of groups that when you talk about

2895
02:18:10,379 --> 02:18:12,718
the one percent of the zero point one

2896
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:15,000
percent their income is not

2897
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,820
the remuneration of labor but holding

2898
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:22,260
shares uh bonds etc etc

2899
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:26,160
um so this kind of kind of explains why

2900
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:30,240
people that depends on an income from

2901
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:34,859
labor if there's no real wage increases

2902
02:18:34,859 --> 02:18:37,558
well you lose out on people that are

2903
02:18:37,558 --> 02:18:39,660
basically representing Capital that are

2904
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:41,840
shareholders and that kind of runs away

2905
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:44,398
and this kind of the research by by

2906
02:18:44,398 --> 02:18:46,799
picture looking at to the share of the

2907
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:50,040
0.1 so not the one percent but the 0.1

2908
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:51,058
percent

2909
02:18:51,058 --> 02:18:53,340
uh in the United States Britain Canada

2910
02:18:53,340 --> 02:18:54,840
and Australia

2911
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:58,260
we're back in in the U.S at

2912
02:18:58,260 --> 02:19:01,939
um the 0.1 owning seven percent of

2913
02:19:01,939 --> 02:19:06,058
income right so 0.1 owns seven percent

2914
02:19:06,058 --> 02:19:09,058
of all income in in the US

2915
02:19:09,058 --> 02:19:11,939
so it's just just try to imagine what

2916
02:19:11,939 --> 02:19:15,120
that means so and it's it's and every

2917
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:18,179
time you see uh economic growth and if

2918
02:19:18,179 --> 02:19:19,920
it's not automatic automatically

2919
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:22,200
translated into an increase in wages

2920
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:24,420
which is obviously a whole bargaining

2921
02:19:24,420 --> 02:19:27,058
process you see that the return on

2922
02:19:27,058 --> 02:19:29,760
Capital increases and but it runs away

2923
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:32,160
from real income

2924
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:34,320
um and I think that will be the main

2925
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:36,840
discussion I think in the post-war era

2926
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:39,240
what you had for instance the US is

2927
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:42,179
extremely progressive taxation the

2928
02:19:42,179 --> 02:19:44,398
higher incomes were was taxation up to

2929
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:47,519
70 it was considered normal

2930
02:19:47,519 --> 02:19:50,160
what you see now in in multiple

2931
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:52,140
presidencies for instance in the US and

2932
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:54,600
that has been relaxed there are now

2933
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:57,720
counter Tendencies I would say corporate

2934
02:19:57,720 --> 02:19:59,820
taxation there's a whole debate about

2935
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:02,580
that to what extent uh we need to kind

2936
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:05,100
of increase that or standardize that it

2937
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:07,880
is a kind of multi-level chess game

2938
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:10,740
uh which will be hard to realize but at

2939
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:12,840
least some things are going on that so I

2940
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:16,740
think yeah at the top end I think I mean

2941
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:19,560
if all goes normal there's no social

2942
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:21,899
upheaval I think the strength will just

2943
02:20:21,899 --> 02:20:23,820
continue and the question is to what

2944
02:20:23,820 --> 02:20:27,300
extent to when is this socially feasible

2945
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:29,040
to keep things together or will it

2946
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:30,899
really pull apart and political and

2947
02:20:30,899 --> 02:20:32,880
other kind of terms when you think about

2948
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:35,340
cities and then as the final point it

2949
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:37,620
means that this function of cities is

2950
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:39,840
becoming uh transformed as well and

2951
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:41,280
maybe this links a little bit to what

2952
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:43,080
Brett Christopher was talking about last

2953
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:45,899
week is that cities become

2954
02:20:45,899 --> 02:20:50,280
basically safety deposit boxes for those

2955
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:52,800
people that rely on wealth uh you can

2956
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:55,319
think about absent renterism in London

2957
02:20:55,319 --> 02:20:57,060
there's all kinds of neighborhoods that

2958
02:20:57,060 --> 02:20:59,819
are owned for instance by people from uh

2959
02:20:59,819 --> 02:21:02,640
the Arab Persian Gulf that don't live in

2960
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:05,939
London but just yeah and they don't even

2961
02:21:05,939 --> 02:21:07,979
bother to rent out parts of

2962
02:21:07,979 --> 02:21:10,319
Knightsbridge or Chelsea because they

2963
02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:12,000
don't care because they're the value of

2964
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,460
these properties just increases so much

2965
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:15,479
that

2966
02:21:15,479 --> 02:21:17,819
it's irrelevant whether you rent it out

2967
02:21:17,819 --> 02:21:21,000
another example is shell companies in

2968
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:24,319
Manhattan the Time Warner Center

2969
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:27,479
on average 30 million per Apartments I

2970
02:21:27,479 --> 02:21:29,520
think 80 percent of this case is bought

2971
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:31,740
by shell companies which is basically

2972
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:33,780
trusts within a trust within the trust

2973
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:35,939
or whatever so it's somewhere in the

2974
02:21:35,939 --> 02:21:38,160
Cayman Islands or Bermuda trust that

2975
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:40,920
boys these uh properties but you never

2976
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:43,800
really know who's behind these shell

2977
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:46,560
companies so it's a way to uh for which

2978
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:48,660
individuals and corporations to buy into

2979
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:52,380
the same profit property

2980
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:55,620
to maintain the value of those assets to

2981
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:58,979
store their wealth in places

2982
02:21:58,979 --> 02:22:03,660
and yeah to end on the final point it

2983
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:06,720
means that the function of cities is

2984
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:08,520
being transformed as

2985
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:11,280
yeah as holders of value

2986
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:14,640
uh primarily and according to Sasuke

2987
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,640
assassin and the death I conclude

2988
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:19,740
there's a real danger that a process of

2989
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:21,720
deurbanization

2990
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:24,899
is taking place in these leading world

2991
02:22:24,899 --> 02:22:27,780
and Global cities and the case of

2992
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:29,939
abstinent terrorism is a good one

2993
02:22:29,939 --> 02:22:32,580
there's absolutely no life nobody is

2994
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:34,439
living there it's a kind of pure

2995
02:22:34,439 --> 02:22:37,620
financial asset or it's an empty Tower

2996
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:40,100
block where nobody lives

2997
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:42,600
uh and it seems to be a very big

2998
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:44,100
contradiction because when you think

2999
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:44,780
about

3000
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:47,880
bustling bustling world and Global

3001
02:22:47,880 --> 02:22:51,120
cities with a lot of innovation and

3002
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:53,220
diversity etc etc

3003
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:55,380
these are empty shells

3004
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:58,140
there to store the value and the wealth

3005
02:22:58,140 --> 02:23:00,840
of a very very very very very very rich

3006
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:04,740
people and I think it's a huge issue

3007
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:06,899
that we should reflect on

3008
02:23:06,899 --> 02:23:10,370
okay thank you

3009
02:23:10,370 --> 02:23:11,540
[Music]

3010
02:23:11,540 --> 02:23:15,359
thank you uh I hope it was not too

3011
02:23:15,359 --> 02:23:17,460
depressing

3012
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:20,100
um or maybe it that it is depressing and

3013
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:23,100
that we do something about it

3014
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,220
um
